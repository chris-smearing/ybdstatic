								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing six top designs for power, efficiency and easy handling, we chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F8DZQV/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; Elite</a> as the best canister vacuum. The unique multi-mode floor head switches quickly between carpets and bare floors, and the power and dust control on this model are competitive with popular dealer-sold vacuums going for double or triple the price. If you&#8217;re not sure about the long hose of a canister vacuum but want more flexibility than an upright, the bagless <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> has the best features from both types.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After testing <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuums</a>, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">upright vacuums</a>, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-car-vacuum/">car vacuums</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vacuums for pet hair</a>, we turned our attention to the prestigious category dominated by thousand-dollar European super-vacuums beloved by enthusiasts (and dealers, if not repair technicians) worldwide.</p>
<p>We thought long and hard about a budget for this review. We read all about Miele, Riccar, Sebo and other well-known makers who have canister vacuums that compete for shelf space at vacuum dealers. Miele is especially notable, since they consistently take top scores in publications like Consumer Reports and even the usually-budget-conscious Wirecutter. We also talked to vacuum dealers and watched them demonstrate these luxury vacuums and rave about their power, longevity and long-term value.</p>
<p>After our pet vacuum tester&#8217;s lackluster experience with his own Miele &#8211; Calima, though, we thought long and hard about how to qualify value for a general review. </p>
<p>Given how well our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">upright vacuum review</a> winners handle the same situations a canister excels in, we settled on a high-but-comparable $450 price maximum as a first criteria. This eliminated even the least-expensive Miele models with a power head, like the $700 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XHQJKKD/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Compact C2 Electro+</a>. Other high-end brands were even farther out of reach.</p>
<p>We think you should know these prestige brands are out there, and if you&#8217;re researching canister vacuums you&#8217;ve almost certainly heard people rave about them, but none of our team members could imagine spending $700 to $1200 on a vacuum given how good the less expensive brands have become.</p>
<p>Looking for results of vacuum tests that weren&#8217;t specifically dealer-sponsored advertisements, we quickly found that Kenmore is the only major seller of canister vacuums with filtration and carpet-cleaning features we&#8217;ve come to expect in this middle-tier price range.</p>
<p>We also looked at consumer satisfaction numbers from Consumer Reports and J.D. Power, along with retailer customer reviews and YouTube reviews, to pick three more competing designs that could fit into tighter budgets along with the mid-range Kenmore and Shark vacuums.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, a canister vacuum separates the motor and dust receptacle from the tools you hold with a long hose. Most of the weight of the vacuum is in the &#8220;canister&#8221; that follows you around on the floor, so you&#8217;re more free to move around and reach tight places.</p>
<p>Canister vacuums have the advantage in smaller rooms. The low-profile head of a canister vacuum’s pickup tool fits under furniture, and the lower weight makes tight corners less tiring. The drawbacks start when you have to move the canister body while you’re vacuuming.</p>
<p>An upright vacuum, by comparison, really shines if you need to clean up and down a carpeted hall or over a large open space. The cord is usually long enough that you can finish the job without unplugging, and you won’t have to drag a canister along behind you.</p>
<p>Canister vacuums are popular in Europe, and upright vacuums are overwhelmingly more popular among American homeowners. This shift probably comes down to a difference in floor plans, with spread-out wall-to-wall carpeting floorspace favoring uprights versus the bare floors and staircases of old-world architecture.</p>
<h3>Air vs. electric brushrolls</h3>
<p>For cleaning carpet, a spinning brush roller works much better than suction alone by agitating the carpet and sweeping up the dirt and hair as they bounce around. This is a defining trait of most upright vacuums, but you can get a brushroll head for many canister vacuums.</p>
<p>Canisters often come only with air-turbine-powered brushroll tools, though, which means that the flow of air spins a turbine that powers the brushroll. That&#8217;s better than no roller at all on low-pile carpet. However, we found when testing the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuums</a> against our writer&#8217;s own air-driven <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S1AGM30/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Miele &#8211; Calima</a> that even expensive turbine heads are poor at picking up hair, and they don&#8217;t have enough power to agitate long-pile carpet.</p>
<p>For this review, we tested two canister vacuums from Kenmore that use motorized brushrolls, and one turbine-powered system from Electrolux.</p>
<h3>A third way: Shark&#8217;s Lift-Away system</h3>
<p>Shark’s “Lift-Away” vacuum design tries to split the difference between a canister and an upright: When you want to separate the bulky motor housing from the floor tools you can just push a button and detach it. The hose is very short compared to a purpose-built canister system, but it has many of the same strengths when you need to vacuum under a bed or on carpeted stairs.</p>
<p>Note that among Shark models, only the more expensive &#8220;powered lift-away&#8221; models like the Apex can run the brushroll motor when the base is detached. We&#8217;ve tested the value-oriented Navigator in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">best upright vacuum review</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuum review</a>, but we only compared the more versatile Apex against canister vacuums.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Appropriate floor tools:</b> If you only need to clean bare floors, the most basic sweeping heads will work quite well at picking up dirt. As soon as you need to work on carpet, though, an electric rotary-brush head helps shake out and capture more dirt.</p>
<p><b>Bagged vs. bagless system: </b>Most popular canister vacuums still use bags to capture dirt, despite upright vacuums switching almost entirely to bagless designs. Bags often capture fine dust better, and they can make it easier to dispose of what you&#8217;ve vacuumed up if you don&#8217;t have the option of stepping outside to empty it.</p>
<p><b>Hose length:</b> The length of a hose will determine how much area you can clean before you have to start dragging the motor around.</p>
<p><b>Retractable cord: </b>While the canister design means that you&#8217;ve always got a hose taking up space in the closet, a common convenience on these vacuums is a retractable power cord.</p>
<p><b>Height control:</b> On the plushest carpet, wheels that lift the brushroll head above the ends of the fibers will allow you to continue gliding smoothly even with strong suction power and strong agitation from a brushroll.</p>
<p><b>Onboard tool storage: </b>Specialized tools for detail cleaning are handy to have, but if there&#8217;s no place to keep them on the vacuum itself, many of us will keep them in a box and forget about them quickly.</p>
<p><b>HEPA-class filters</b>: High-efficiency particulate air filters (almost always called HEPA-class) are defined by the U.S. Department of Energy as filters trapping 99.97% of tiny 0.3-micron particles that pass through. If the manufacturer doesn&#8217;t specify HEPA filtration, you&#8217;re almost certainly blowing a lot of fine dust into the air when you vacuum.</p>
<p><b>Sealed-system airflow:</b> Expensive filters are needed to capture allergy-triggering dust, but if your vacuum isn&#8217;t well-sealed, some of that dust will just leak out all the same.</p>

<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<p>The critical tests for a vacuum involve, of course, cleaning floors. But the features that make a vacuum excellent on tile floors may not be as good on wall-to-wall carpet, area rugs or hardwood.</p>
<p>We sprinkled samples of precisely weighed debris samples on carpet, then weighed the bags or canisters of the vacuums after to see how much of the dirt was recovered. On bare floors, we put down the same dirt as well as cereal and tested for scatter and efficient pick up of the biggest pieces.</p>
<p>A powered &#8220;beater&#8221; brushroll makes a big difference getting sand and dirt out of carpet, and it was easy to see the impact of agitation and brushing in the results.</p>
[table id=322 /]
<p>The turbine-powered brushroll on the Electrolux &#8211; EL4021A didn&#8217;t help much, though. It got stuck in longer carpet fibers and was only slightly more effective than the bare-floor tools included in less expensive vacuums. The height control on the Kenmore heads gave the biggest advantage in long-pile carpet, but Shark&#8217;s dual-brush system performed almost just as well.</p>
<p>Too much suction will make it hard to move a vacuum over thick carpet, or even get caught on the edges of area rugs. All of these canister vacuums offer some way to either slow down the suction motor or allow some air to bypass through a vent. That makes them more versatile than even the most prestigious brands in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">upright vacuum review</a> that just got bogged down or stuck.</p>
<h3>Suction</h3>
<p>In order to compare the raw power of these vacuum motors, we plugged them each into a vacuum gauge rig and noted the maximum amount of negative pressure made by the motors.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25539" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test.jpg" alt="Suction test" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The difference in power between the most expensive and least expensive groups is worth noting, but all of these vacuums have enough power to easily pick up heavy sand and debris on all floor types. For carpet, the higher suction numbers won&#8217;t really help without excellent height control, or a more complex brushroll system like the Shark &#8211; Apex uses.</p>
<h3>HEPA filter</h3>
<p>We logged air quality readings with a Dylos particle counter before, during and after our cleaning tests to see how well the HEPA-class filters in some models actually capture dust. These tests weren&#8217;t performed in a sealed room, but the air was cleaned to a baseline level between tests with the Winix air purifier from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">air purifier review</a> running for five minutes.</p>
<p>The readings after vacuuming showed even most HEPA-filter vacuums kicking up three times more large dust particles into the air than we measured at the start of the test — on average from 13 up to 48 parts per million (PPM). The worst case was the Bissell &#8211; Zing: Its basic foam filter didn&#8217;t catch much dust, and there was ten times the starting level in the air after vacuuming.</p>
<p>Between its strong airflow and effective filter design, the Kenmore &#8211; Elite made an impressive 20% improvement in air quality compared to starting conditions — a powerful sealed-system vacuum can actually clean your air as well as your floor.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t carefully time the vacuuming time on this test, only analyzing the performance while actively cleaning our test carpet. In past tests, we&#8217;ve seen that a good vacuum from Shark or Dyson can clean the air if it&#8217;s left running for a few minutes, but the Kenmore did that even while cleaning the floor.</p>
[table id=323 /]
<h3>Noise</h3>
<p>We tested all of the vacuums from the same distance, at ear-height while moving the vacuums as they would be used for cleaning. We used a meter with an &#8220;A-weighted&#8221; frequency bias, which emphasizes the effect of bothersome high-pitch sounds and is the standard method to measure noise (rather than something like music).</p>
<p>The winner of this test was no surprise. The Shark &#8211; Apex won our pick for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">best upright vacuum</a> and is the quietest vacuum we&#8217;ve ever used: With the brushroll turned down to bare-floor mode the suction motor puts out 88 dBA, about as loud as the average level of film dialog in most movie theaters. Turning up the brushroll speed for carpet increased the noise to a fairly normal 93 dBA, very close to the same volume as the more expensive Kenmore &#8211; Elite.</p>
<p>By comparison, the air-powered brushroll on the Eureka brought the noise level up to 102 decibels — definitely not something you&#8217;ll want to use early in the morning.</p>
<h3>Storage and ergonomics</h3>
[table id=324 /]
<p>The biggest advantage of a canister vacuum is the long reach offered by the hose, but compared to <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">the best upright vacuums</a> or <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuums</a>, that&#8217;s also a downside when you need to put it in the closet. As a consolation, most of these canister vacuums offer collapsing wands and retracting power cords to keep the storage as simple as possible.</p>
<p>An adjustable-length attachment wand is mostly important for reaching high ceilings or vacuuming on top of furniture with a detail brush, but some shorter or taller people may also find vacuuming the floor easier after adjusting the length of the wand.</p>
<p>Probably the most important factor for ease of use is the location of the vacuum&#8217;s controls. Usually only the most expensive vacuums give you power and brushroll control switches on the handle; less expensive models require you to reach down to the base of the vacuum or tap buttons with your foot.</p>
<h3>Tools and accessories</h3>
[table id=325 /]
<p>One accessory that sets apart the most expensive vacuums is a small powered rotary-brush tool, specifically designed for grabbing pet hair that sticks to furniture. Less-expensive vacuums sometimes include an air-powered version that might be worth trying out, but those are ineffective for tougher jobs like cleaning carpeted stairs.</p>
<p>All models we tested include a detail brush and a crevice tool to get into furniture cracks. The best models also include a place to keep every tool so they won&#8217;t get lost in your closet.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top pick: Kenmore &#8211; Elite</h2>

<p>If you want a top-class canister vacuum with great suction power and a versatile cleaning head that will handle both carpet and bare floors, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F8DZQV/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; Elite 21814 Crossover</a> is our choice.</p>
<p>This has all the strengths of a top-of-the-line canister vacuum system: It&#8217;s lightweight, has excellent organization features for easy storage and a bagged dirt collection system that captures more fine dust and makes disposal easy.</p>
<p>Kenmore gives you all these features for less than $500. Given that the canister vacuums you&#8217;ll find at vacuum dealers will usually cost $800 or even $1200 for a comparable feature set, it&#8217;s a bargain.</p>
<h3>Multi-surface design</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kenmore-crossover-mode.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Rather than having a separate head for carpet and bare-floor cleaning, Kenmore gives you a convertible system called the “Crossover&#8221; head. The bare-floor tool snaps into the carpet head, and it&#8217;s easy to lift out with the press of a foot lever.</p>
<p>The Crossover head is a very good carpet head, with an easy-to-adjust height control and a heavy hardwood agitator brushroll that will help you get dirt out of your carpet. This head is easier to steer on carpet than the less expensive Kenmore design, though not quite as refined as the Shark.</p>
<h3>The most powerful vacuum cleaner</h3>
<p>The Kenmore &#8211; Elite has the best suction power of all the vacuums we&#8217;ve tested — even 5% better than the new motor design in the Apex — pulling minus 23 kilopascals of air pressure. That makes it excellent for getting dirt out of floor cracks and picking crumbs out of your couch.</p>
<p>Moving up the handle, the premium features that set the Elite apart from other canister vacuums in the under-$500 price bracket are handle-mounted control. You can turn the vacuum on and activate or deactivate the brushroll without bending over, and you can also control the level of suction bypass with an easy-to-use slider. This means you&#8217;ve got full manual control of the vacuum, making it easier to move from bare floors to small area rugs to full carpet.</p>
<h3>Best vacuum for allergies</h3>
<p>It’s a high-quality vacuum just by itself, but Kenmore also gives you excellent filtration. We were also impressed by the performance of other sealed systems like the Shark in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">pet hair vacuum tests</a>, but the Kenmore was about 20% better at capturing fine dust.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;ve got a complete line of accessory tools, it&#8217;s important that the vacuum provides a good place to keep them all. Fortunately Kenmore did just that with the Elite, so you don&#8217;t have to hunt in your closet for missing tools when it&#8217;s time to clean your blinds.</p>
<p>Like most good canister vacuums, the Kenmore includes a retractable power cord. There&#8217;s an adjustable-length wand that goes from 43 to 55 inches, both for the comfort of taller or shorter users and for reaching up to the ceiling with the cleaning brush attachments.</p>
<p>The Kenmore &#8211; Elite is designed to sit securely on a stair, and it does that job well. There&#8217;s even an included Pet PowerMate miniature brush head that makes quick touch-up jobs easy. It&#8217;s better for cleaning dog hair off of sofa cushions than it is for a full staircase job, but at least it won&#8217;t stall out on carpet like turbine-powered tools do.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>For the most power and great features, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F8DZQV/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; Elite 21814 Crossover</a> competes with vacuums that cost double or triple this price.</li>
<li>The full-size bare floor head and powered carpet head dock together for quickly changing between floor types.</li>
<li>The included HEPA-class filtration works well enough to clean your air while you vacuum.</li>
<li>It was the quietest of the conventional canisters we tested, even at full power.</li>
<li>This is a big vacuum, only slightly more nimble than an upright.</li>

<h2 id="bagless-pick">Bagless pick: Shark &#8211; Apex</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25538" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo.jpg" alt="Shark - Apex" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shark-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We chose to include the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> lift-away vacuum in this roundup of canister designs because it represents a unique set of attributes at an excellent value. This is more closely related to an upright vacuum than a canister, but it&#8217;s one of the few uprights that makes just as much sense for a household that would typically prefer a canister design.</p>
<p>While most traditional vacuums basically force you to switch between a rotary-brush head for effective carpet cleaning and a simpler suction-only head for bare floors, Shark has pioneered the use of a thick, soft roller that captures dirt on bare floors and doesn&#8217;t just throw it around before it gets sucked in. They call this a &#8220;DuoClean&#8221; brush system, and it works effectively on all the floor types we&#8217;ve tried.</p>
<p>The Shark is also more agile than other fully-powered brushroll systems, and it has handle-switched lower-power settings that will keep it from eating up area rugs. For mixed flooring types, this vacuum is just as good as the Kenmore Elite, but you can&#8217;t shed the weight of the brushroll for quicker coverage of large bare-floor surfaces.</p>
<h3>Also the best for pet hair</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brushspin.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The Apex also features Shark&#8217;s new &#8220;Zero-M&#8221; system, which actively combs out hairs so they don&#8217;t get wrapped around the roller. This makes the Shark &#8211; Apex the best canister vacuum for pet hair, or even for extra-long human hair. You&#8217;ll only ever catch a few strands on the roller, which eliminates the maintenance needed on traditional roller designs.</p>
<p>Bagless designs usually aren&#8217;t quite as good at capturing fine dust, but part of what makes this Shark the best bagless canister vacuum is a HEPA filter that worked better than the rest (including Dyson&#8217;s) in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">review of upright vacuums</a>. Against the tougher competition of bagged canister vacuums, the Apex let more fine dust into the air than Kenmore&#8217;s top-of-the-line sealed bag system did. The difference is only about 20%, and the Shark captured more large dust particles, so we&#8217;re happy with this performance considering the other advantages of the system.</p>
<p>Shark also includes the obligatory mini-power-brush for cleaning dog hair off your sofa. It’s powered by an electric motor so it won&#8217;t just stall out the way cheaper versions of this attachment do if you try to use them on your stairs.</p>
<p>Most of Shark&#8217;s accessories have a handy storage spot, but the various model numbers (we tested the AZ1000W) may include accessory brushes that don&#8217;t have a home.</p>

The soft rollers work well on all surfaces, but the hose is short in canister mode.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<h3>The drawbacks</h3>
<p>There are a few things we don&#8217;t like about the Shark in canister mode.</p>
<p>The lack of wheels for the motor canister unit and the very short hose mean you&#8217;re basically forced to carry the motor around in one hand while you vacuum, rather than towing it behind you as you work through tight spaces. The agility of Shark&#8217;s motorized brush head makes steering with one hand no problem, but if you&#8217;ve got a large room to cover you&#8217;ll definitely want to use upright mode most of the time.</p>
<p>The Shark doesn&#8217;t have a retractable cord. That&#8217;s not the most important feature on a vacuum, but it&#8217;s a standard on canister designs and makes storage easier. Retractable cord systems add weight and the Apex is already a heavy vacuum as it is, but on a premium-tier vacuum, we&#8217;d like to see some innovation beyond the bare-bones wrapping system.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re only interested in a canister vacuum for tricky spots like vacuuming under a coffee table and on the stairs, the Shark &#8211; Apex will handle those jobs well while serving as a full-featured multi-surface upright vacuum the rest of the time.</p>
<p>If you think the short-hose lift-away mode will meet your needs, but you&#8217;re not interested in using it on carpet, and you want to save some money, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a> was a runner-up in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">best upright vacuum review</a> and winner of our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuum review</a>. It&#8217;s still excellent at cleaning carpets in an upright configuration while giving acceptable performance in lift-away mode on bare floors.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> has more versatility than any other vacuum we&#8217;ve looked at.</li>
<li>Ideal if you only need canister-style flexibility in a few places.</li>
<li>A sealed bagless design and HEPA filter manage dust very well.</li>
<li>Shark&#8217;s new brush design prevents pet hair from tangling.</li>
<li>Soft, powered rollers are excellent on everything from hardwood to carpet.</li>

<p>Choosing a canister vacuum without a powered carpet head was tricky, since the bare-floor cleaning that these vacuums are best at isn&#8217;t particularly complicated. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075PKTS85/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; Zing</a> offers good power at a very affordable price, and it doesn&#8217;t skimp on the details.</p>
<p>The Zing offers basically the same two-mode floor-cleaning head as the other sub-$300 vacuums we tested, with a bristle-down position for gliding across hardwood and tile and a bristle-retracted mode for sliding along low-pile carpet.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to use a basic canister vacuum like this for medium-pile or longer carpet; it&#8217;ll just get stuck. You can turn down the suction to make gliding along easier, but at that point you&#8217;re not really vacuuming up much dirt. The Bissell &#8211; Zing did manage to pull slightly more dirt out of our test carpet than the other non-powered heads in our test, but it was a very difficult process.</p>

For bare floors and cleaning tight spots, this is a tool that will get the job done efficiently.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075PKTS85/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Bissell also lacks the HEPA filter featured on more expensive canisters, and it threw five times more dust particles into the air than the closest competition. That said, vacuuming when nobody will be in a room for a few hours, then running an <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">air purifier</a> or opening a window and using a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-tower-fan/">tower fan</a>, can take care of that problem.</p>
<p>The biggest strength of the Bissell is simplicity. You still get essential features, like a retractable power cord and adjustable-length wand, but the only accessory comes in the form of a clip-on brush and crevice multi-purpose tool.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>For less than $75, the Bissell &#8211; Zing is a compact, effective vacuum.</li>
<li>The bare-floor tool serves its intended function well.</li>
<li>Storage and handling features are surprisingly refined.</li>
<li>This bagged system only has basic dust filtering.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t bother with a vacuum like this for carpet or area rugs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Kenmore &#8211; 200 Series</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25535" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series.jpg" alt="Kenmore - 200 series" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you want a powered brushroll for some carpet-cleaning tasks but don&#8217;t need all the other features of the Kenmore &#8211; Elite, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F4YTVF/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; 81214 200 Series</a> canister vacuum is an affordable mid-range option.</p>
<p>For about a $200 savings compared to the Elite, you&#8217;ve given up handle-mounted controls, the bigger bare-floor tool, two feet of hose length, noise reduction, dust capture performance and more agile steering. This isn&#8217;t a vacuum we&#8217;d choose above other designs unless budget were the primary consideration.</p>
<p>Compared to the other sub-$300 vacuums we tested, you still get a motorized height-adjustable carpet head and a powerful suction motor. The small bare-floor head and difficult steering on carpet really handicap this model in most households where a mid-range canister vacuum makes sense, though.</p>
<h3>Electrolux &#8211; EL4021A</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25532" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux.jpg" alt="Electrolux" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J8AYAT4/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Electrolux &#8211; EL4021A</a> is a bagless canister vacuum from a well-regarded manufacturer, but its middle-tier features and performance make it hard to recommend.</p>
<p>Most confusing of the results from our tests were the air quality results for this model: Despite the advertised HEPA filter, this vacuum kicked up just as much dust as the non-HEPA Bissell model.</p>
<p>Electrolux includes a turbine-powered carpet head with this model, and that was also a disappointment. It&#8217;s incredibly loud, and stalls out quickly on anything thicker than tight-knit carpet like Berber. The Electrolux was light and fairly easy to maneuver, but for cleaning performance the Kenmore &#8211; 200 Series has it totally beat.</p>
<h3>Eureka &#8211; Mighty Mite Pet Lover</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25533" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka.jpg" alt="Eureka" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For those looking at budget vacuums but are still in need of dust filtration, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0019KOFEC/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; Mighty Mite Pet Lover</a> takes a popular utility vacuum design and literally clips an extra filter to the back.</p>
<p>The Mighty Mite isn&#8217;t a bad little vacuum, but the price increase to get the HEPA filter is hard to swallow. Compared to the Bissell &#8211; Zing, you get bigger detailing tools (with some onboard storage) but give up some airflow on account of the filter. You can attach the hose to the exhaust side of this canister for situations when you want a blower, but you&#8217;re better off buying an inexpensive <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">leaf blower</a> for most situations where that would be an asset.</p>
<p>The included air-turbine-powered pet-hair brush isn&#8217;t good on carpet, and there&#8217;s no place to store it on the vacuum so most owners will likely lose it quickly.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re seriously considering the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014P3BL5U/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">less expensive Eureka &#8211; 3670h</a> without the $40 filter, look closely at the Bissell &#8211; Zing first. The retractable cord is a worthwhile upgrade for most households.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Canister vacuums aren&#8217;t as popular in North America as upright vacuums, but we&#8217;ve tested and compared them in situations where they make the most sense: Tight quarters, bare-floor cleaning and situations where the extra dust control from a bagged system is a key asset.</p>
<p>With those parameters, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F8DZQV/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; Elite</a> is a clear winner for anyone who also needs to deal with carpeted floors. The power, filter performance, ease of use and flexibility of this system are competitive with the better-known European brands, but at one-third the price.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re covering enough floor that you&#8217;re trying to decide between a canister and upright vacuum, the convertible <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> has most of the flexibility on stairs and in tight spaces as a canister, but is much better on open ground. It&#8217;s easily the best bagless vacuum we&#8217;ve tested.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you&#8217;re looking for an inexpensive canister vacuum with only a bare floor head, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075PKTS85/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; Zing</a> is our budget pick. It doesn&#8217;t have the filter or carpet-cleaning prowess of other vacuums, but it has plenty of power for the price.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested some highly rated automatic tea makers and iced tea makers and selected the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQTZ6P3/?tag=ybdtea-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BTM500</a> as the best automatic tea maker for hot tea and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00921MFKG/?tag=ybdtea-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Takeya &#8211; 11171</a> as the best iced tea maker.</p>
<p>We’ve used an <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-electric-kettle/">electric tea kettle</a> for years, but an automatic tea maker eliminates the fussiness from the tea-making process, especially if you brew loose tea leaves. The tea infuser is integrated into the kettle, so you simply push a couple of buttons, and in under 10 minutes, you have a perfectly steeped and piping hot cup of tea.</p>
<p>An iced tea maker funnels the hot tea into a pitcher of ice, and again, in a few minutes, you have a pitcher of iced tea to cool you off on a hot summer day.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to buy an automatic tea maker for hot tea, the best ones have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmed settings for your favorite type of tea, including brew temperature and time, and steep temperature steep time</li>
<li>A separate timer for alerting you when the water has reached optimal temperature for adding the tea and a second alert when the tea has finished steeping</li>
<li>Stainless steel trim can help match other kitchen appliances</li>
<li>A borosilicate glass pitcher, which can withstand extreme changes in temperature</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e squeezed thirty pounds of oranges, lemons and limes to find the best citrus juicer, and we chose <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185NWN62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urban Trend &#8211; Tango</a> as the best manual citrus juicer. Its ergonomic design and two interchangeable reamer cones make this hand-held juicer ideal for a quick glass of fresh OJ as you’re running out the door. We also like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011KGTVIY/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dash &#8211; JB065AQ </a>as the best electric citrus juicer for its seven pulp modes, ease of cleanup and great price.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected citrus juicers to test</h2>
<p>If you’re dedicated to the juicing life, then you may already own a high-end juice extractor or blender like Vitamix, which we reviewed in our article about the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-blender/">best blenders</a>. You could easily spend hundreds of dollars on a high-end model, but for this review, we focused on the small citrus juicers — manual and electric — in the $10-$25 price range.</p>
<p>After reading consumer reviews, we narrowed our search down from dozens of almost identical juicers to juicers with a unique feature, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185NWN62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urban Trend’s interchangeable reamer cones</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073PVYM62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bnunwish’s twist-and-squeeze lid</a> or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C22MYGM/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunhanny</a> that can also separate an egg. Sometimes, simple is best, so we also chose to test the type of metallic handheld juicer, like the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O525UL8/?tag=ybdjuice-20">IMUSA</a>, that you see used in every bar and restaurant,</p>
<p>There are several inexpensive electric juicers available, and we wanted to see if they were actually more convenient and user-friendly than the manual juicers. The primary advantage to using an electric citrus juicer is that you’re able to adjust how much (or little) pulp will be processed into the juice. The three electric juicers we tested had different modes for pulp adjustment, but only our top pick, Urban Trend, was effective.</p>

<p>We tested the manual citrus juicers by squeezing Navel oranges, limes and lemons and measured how much juice was extracted. On average, the Navel oranges produced ¼ cup of juice, limes produced two tablespoons and lemons produced three tablespoons.</p>
<p>Factors we considered were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was squeezing juice effortless, or did the juicer need a lot of hand strength?</li>
<li>Did fruit pips and pulp get lodged in the juicer’s filter?</li>
<li>Was the juicer easy and quick to clean?</li>
</ul>
<p>For the electric juicers, we doubled the amount of fruits squeezed with the manual juicers, since their receptacles were designed to hold 25–32 ounces of juice. The electric juicers produced the same amount of juice per fruit, but two of the juicers’ filters were clogged by pulp and pips after juicing a single orange.</p>
<p>We also considered whether the pulp-adjustment feature worked, how easy the juicers were to clean and if it was indeed more convenient to use an electric juicer over a manual juicer.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011KGTVIY/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dash &#8211; JB065AQ</a> beat the other two electric citrus juicers because it had, by far, the easiest pulp adjustment: a small lever on the container’s handle with seven choices for filtering pulp that can be adjusted any time while juicing.</p>
<p>The Dash has two reamer cones that nest and lock into place on top of the 25-ounce container. Halved fruit is placed on top of the reamer, and by pressing down, the juicer automatically starts; releasing pressure, it automatically stops. The Dash isn’t the quietest of the juicers we tested, but it won’t wake up sleeping housemates on Saturday morning either.</p>
<p>Like most electric juicers of this type, you can whiz through a bag of oranges in a couple of minutes. However, what we liked most about the Dash was that the pulp didn’t clog up the filter. Although the Black+Decker and the Cuisinart have larger capacity, it didn’t really matter, because we were continually stopping to unclog the filter, so it took longer to juice oranges. (This wasn’t an issue with lemons and limes, which have little pulp.)</p>

<p>The smaller reamer cone was better shaped for lemons than for limes, but by simply moving the halved lime around the reamer — rather than holding it in place — all of its juice was extracted.</p>
<p>It comes with a lid so you can store squeezed juice in the refrigerator. Although the manufacturer claims the Dash can be machine washed, it’s made of plastic, and high-heat drying in a dishwasher will most likely damage it.</p>
<p>This isn’t a heavy-duty or sophisticated juicer, but its compact size and affordable price make it a good choice for a small kitchen, dorm room or camper.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to operate and easy to clean, the Dash &#8211; JB065AQ also effectively squeezes juice down to the skin in seconds.</li>
<li>It has an excellent pulp-adjustment control that can be changed any time during juicing.</li>
<li>The Dash’s reamer cones nest and snap into the juice receptacle for compact storage.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185NWN62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urban Trend &#8211; Tango</a>’s ergonomic design gave this finalist the edge over the other two manual citrus juicers we tested. It has two interchangeable reamers: one for oranges and grapefruit and another for lemons and limes. Each fits snugly into a ladle-shaped container that can hold 8 ounces (1 cup) of juice. The container has a non-slip base that stabilizes the juicer on a countertop or table.</p>
<p>Each head has a handle that snaps into the container’s handle, and the two halves form a handle that fits into the palm of your hand. As with all manual juicers, the halved fruit is twisted on top of the reamer, and pulp and seeds are trapped in the reamer’s filter while juice is strained into the container.</p>
<p>The Tango’s orange/grapefruit reamer was particularly effective in getting down to the orange’s skin and juicing every bit of fruit. The lemon/lime reamer was great with lemons, since its pointed shape fit perfectly into the halved fruit. Halved limes are more rounded, so we had to move the fruit around the reamer, but this took only seconds, and the reamer extracted two tablespoons of juice, which is the usual amount of juice that can be squeezed from a lime.</p>

<p>The Tango’s filters are narrow enough on both reamers that seeds don’t get stuck in between, and with a quick rinse, the juicer is clean. The orange reamer nests on top of the lime reamer, so the entire juicer can fit into any drawer.</p>
<p>The Tango is perfect for juice on the go. If you want a glass of fresh OJ before rushing off to work, this juicer will get it done with little effort in under a minute.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Urban Trend &#8211; Tango has two interchangeable reamers that squeeze out every drop of juice from fruit.</li>
<li>Its container has a non-skid base so the juicer won’t move on a countertop or table when you’re squeezing the fruit.</li>
<li>The reamers nest into the container, so the Tango can be stored in any kitchen drawer.</li>

<h3>Bnunwish &#8211; AABK03</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073PVYM62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bnunwish &#8211; AABK03</a> manual juicer is a tall 16-ounce cup with a reamer-cone insert that has a webbed filter for catching pulp. The halved fruit is placed on top of the reamer, and the juicer’s lid goes on top of the fruit. You rotate the lid, pressing down, and when it connects with the cup, the fruit has been completely squeezed of juice. The Bnunwish actually extracted quite a lot of juice from all of the citrus fruits, but it was a pain to clean. Pulp got trapped in the webbing, and although a tool is included, it took too much time to pick out the pulp. For a single serving of juice, it wasn’t worth the effort.</p>
<h3>Sunhanny</h3>
<p>We confess that we wanted to test the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C22MYGM/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunhanny</a> because of its Amazon video that shows it can not only juice citrus fruits but also separate an egg. The Sunhanny has several pieces, and since no instructions were provided, we watched the video again to learn how to use it.</p>
<p>The Sunhanny’s odd petal-shaped piece for juicing oranges fits on top of the reamer, which then locks into the juicer’s 2-cup container. The Sunhanny worked very much like the Urban Trend &#8211; Tango, but lemon pips lodged into its reamer, which has slits like its pulp filter.</p>
<p>To separate an egg, the reamer is inverted, and when you crack an egg into it, the egg white is supposed to drip into the container. Sadly, it didn’t work, and half of the egg white clung stubbornly to the yolk.</p>
<h3>Black+Decker &#8211; CJ650</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M9J34LL/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; CJ650</a> has only one reamer cone, which easily extracted juice from oranges. But the cone was too wide for lemons and limes, and they slipped off if we didn&#8217;t hold them firmly in place.</p>
<p>The pulp-adjustment switch is inside the filter, and once a setting is selected, it can’t be changed until juicing is complete. We tried each of the Black+Decker’s three pulp-adjustment settings; every time, after juicing only one orange, the filter got clogged with pulp and juice.</p>
<h3>Cuisinart &#8211; CCJ-500</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VS32HA/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CCJ500</a> has three settings that can be adjusted by turning the reamer cone but only when the juicer is unplugged. The reamer cone itself has an unnecessary filter, so pulp got stuck in both the cone and filter, and juice just pooled in the pulp.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has an additional feature we did like. Once the fruit is completely juiced, you can press down on the juicer’s lid, and it will spin a little more juice out of the collected pulp. However, like the Black+Decker, the filter gets clogged after juicing a single orange, which makes the juicer a hassle to clean. We don’t feel the Cuisinart’s inconvenience justifies its high price.</p>
<h3>IMUSA USA &#8211; Victoria 70009</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O525UL8/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IMUSA USA &#8211; Victoria 70009</a> is one of the most common and basic manual juicers. The IMUSA comes in three sizes for oranges, lemons and limes and is made of two aluminum cups with handles that are painted orange, yellow or green. We tested the size for oranges.</p>
<p>Half of a cut fruit is placed into one cup, which has slits for straining seeds, and the other cup is pressed down by gripping the handle.  Pulp isn’t extracted but is compressed instead, and it does require some hand strength to squeeze out juice.</p>
<p>This type of juicer is great for squeezing juice for a couple cocktails or adding some acidity to a sauce or saute. But if you need to squeeze more than two or three fruits at a time, it’s time-consuming and tiring.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The small and inexpensive citrus juicers that we tested squeezed lemons and limes equally well. Squeezing a glass of orange juice, however, was more of a challenge, especially — and surprisingly — for the electric juicers.</p>
<p>Our pick for best electric citrus juicer is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011KGTVIY/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dash &#8211; JB065AQ</a>. The Dash juicer has seven settings for adjusting how much pulp is filtered into the juice that can be changed any time while you’re juicing. It’s easy to use, doesn’t clog with excess pulp, and clean-up is a snap. At less than $15, it’s also a great value.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185NWN62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urban Trend &#8211; Tango</a> is our top pick for manual citrus juicer. It’s a simple, plastic, handheld juicer with two interchangeable and stackable reamer cones that squeeze out every last drop of juice. It has a smart, ergonomic design that fits comfortably in your hand, and its non-skid base prevents slippage when you&#8217;re squeezing juice on a countertop or table.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested eight of the best lightweight vacuums and chose the Shark - Rocket HV302 as the best corded vacuum for everyday and heavy-duty cleaning. We also picked the Eureka - NEC22 as the best cordless lightweight vacuum.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent 20 hours on research and six weeks testing each of the vacuums in a home environment. We chose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUKHACW/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Rocket HV302</a> as our pick for the best lightweight vacuum. Weighing just 8 pounds (the average vacuum weighs 14 to 17 pounds), it is one of the more powerful vacuums we tested. The Shark possesses agility and suction strong enough to make it feel as though it were self-propelled. If you want a cordless model, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNJ7ZR1/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEC222</a> to be the best option. It pulls up an impressive amount of debris and has swivel steering that makes it easy to navigate around furniture.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Since a vacuum weighing more than 15 pounds can cause arm fatigue when pushed around large spaces or carried up stairs, we limited our scope to vacuums weighing 15 pounds and under. Corded vacuums tends to be more powerful, while cordless ones are more convenient. Keeping this in mind, we searched for the best options in each category.</p>
<p>We’ve tested multiple types of vacuums here at Your Best Digs, as we searched for everything from the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">best upright vacuum</a> to the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">best handheld vacuum</a>. These previous experiences have given us a good sense of overall features to consider when also factoring in a lightweight aspect.</p>
<p>For instance, we considered the fact that swivel steering can greatly impact the amount of work it takes to move a vacuum around. If you’re choosing a lightweight vacuum because you want to ease the strain of pushing a heavy vacuum around, this is an important feature to note.</p>
<p>We looked at reputable sources such as Consumer Reports and Wirecutter to gather information about the top lightweight vacuums on the market. Once we narrowed down a list of finalists that had the features we deemed most important, we culled the list further based on Amazon reviews and reports from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LaundryLoveandScience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laundry Love &amp; Cleaning Science</a> Facebook group.</p>

<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Vacuums over 15 pounds become tough to move around, an important consideration if you need to cover more square footage or carry it upstairs. The vacuums we tested weighed 3 to 8 pounds.</li>
<li><strong>Swivel steering:</strong> Maneuverability is key if you’re choosing a vacuum based on its ease of use. Even a lightweight vacuum can cause arm fatigue without swivel steering, since you need to make double the effort to guide it around the room.</li>
<li><strong>Corded vs. cordless:</strong> Corded vacuums are typically more powerful than cordless vacuums, although some newer cordless models are nearly as powerful as a corded vacuum.</li>
<li><strong>Battery life/run time:</strong> If you do choose a cordless model, consider how long the battery takes to charge and how long you can run the vacuum before the battery dies.</li>
<li><strong>Sealed HEPA filter:</strong> If you have allergies or asthma, you’ll want to make sure your vacuum traps dust mites, pet dander and pollen in a tightly sealed system. A vacuum with a sealed HEPA filter must meet the rigorous <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/ttncatc1/dir1/ff-hepa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. HEPA</a> (High Efficiency Particulate Air) standards of removing 99.97 percent of all particles 0.3 microns or larger.</li>
<li><strong>Low profile:</strong> A vacuum that lies flat is able to fit under furniture, which means you can clean without moving heavy objects around the room.</li>
<li><strong>Easy emptying:</strong> Whether using a bagged or bagless model, you should be able to empty the vacuum without dirt escaping.</li>
<li><strong>Brush roll:</strong> A spinning beater brush agitates debris in the carpet for a deeper clean, but on hard floors, it can scratch the surface and fling debris away. A better option for hard flooring is a vacuum that allows you to turn off the beater brush or, better yet, has a soft roller head.</li>
<li><strong>Converts into handheld vacuum:</strong> A model that converts into a handheld vacuum gives you the most bang for your buck and allows you to use it on multiple cleaning tasks. It’s convenient to have a vacuum that can clean your floors as well as your car. If you’re primarily looking to use your vacuum as a handheld, our article on the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum">best handheld vacuum</a> can guide you in the right direction.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple attachments:</strong> Attachments such as a soft roller head for hard floors, a crevice tool and a dusting tool allow you to tackle multiple cleaning jobs with one vacuum.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustable-height cleaning head:</strong> Automatic height adjustment allows you to switch from carpet to hard flooring, although you may want to turn your brush roll off or switch to a soft roller head.</li>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We tested in a household with three children and three fur babies — two dogs and a domestic shorthair cat — and the carpet was embedded with pet hair. We added sand, baking soda (to mimic fine dust) and cereal (large debris) to the mix. Starting with empty collection containers, we passed each vacuum over the area for 30 seconds. Then we weighed the output in grams to test how much each vacuum collected.</p>
<p>Pet hair is naturally lighter than sand or cereal, so while we measured the contents of each collection container, we visually inspected the carpet to see if there was any debris remaining. The type of debris collected gave us insight into which vacuums picked up more fine debris and which gathered the most pet hair.</p>
<p>Finally, we performed the same test again on hard flooring. We paid attention to whether or not the vacuums snowplowed (pushed forward rather than sucked up) the large debris.</p>
<p>The Oreck, Dyson and Eureka were able to capture the most pet hair, sand and baking soda at the same time without the brush roll or filter becoming clogged. The Shark picked up a large amount of pet hair from the carpet, but the hair wound itself around the filter and created a pressure that caused it to “backfire,” sending larger pieces of debris back onto the carpet.</p>
<p>The Hoover does a good job of picking up surface pet hair and cereal, but it doesn’t do much to pull up ground-in dirt and debris from the carpet. It pulls in cereal without snowplowing it across the floor, even better than some of our more expensive finalists. For example, the Tineco isn’t able to retain larger pieces of debris, leaving them on the floor after you move the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Emissions</h3>
<p>The best vacuums are able to keep the dirt contained in their collection bag or cylinder, so the dust and debris isn’t spewed back out into the air. This is especially important if you have allergies. To test filter performance, we measured dust kickback with a Dylos air quality monitor.</p>
<p>The laser counter measures air quality in terms of both large particles (PM10) and small particles (PM2.5). Particle pollution can be especially harmful to those with asthma, older adults and babies and children. Smaller particles are more troublesome because they can get into the deep parts of your lungs.</p>
<p>We took a reading before vacuuming, then measured the air quality again after vacuuming a single room for 10 minutes. Some vacuums, such as the Oreck and the Bissell, caused the numbers to jump dramatically. The Shark and the Dyson actually improved the quality of the air, reducing both large and small airborne particles. The Eureka and Deik were relatively neutral, neither spewing dust nor filtering it out of the air.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>Over the course of six weeks, we used these vacuums to vacuum as any consumer would. We vacuumed in multiple rooms on both hard flooring and carpet for approximately 30 minutes at a time.</p>
<p>Since we wanted to find the best lightweight vacuum, key considerations here were arm fatigue and maneuverability. We rated each vacuum on a scale of one to five (five being best) for ease of use, giving the highest ratings to vacuums that didn’t cause arm fatigue.</p>
<p>We maneuvered each vacuum around the room and judged how easy it was to operate. Then we tested its profile by lying it flat and vacuuming under a couch and living-room chairs. We noted features such as button placement and ability to determine what the settings meant without consulting the manual. Finally, we considered how easy it was to change the filter or empty the waste container.</p>
<p>Our five-star finalists for maneuverability were the Shark, Eureka, Tineco and Deik. Despite being only 8.2 pounds, the Oreck was incredibly difficult to push around the room. The stronger the suction, the more difficult it was to push &#8212; with the exception of the Shark, which feels as if it is propelling forward without effort. Finalists like the Dyson and Tineco were easy to operate, but we encountered resistance on their Max settings and vacuuming became more labor-intensive.</p>
<h3>Noise output</h3>
<p>For this test, we measured the sound output in decibels of each vacuum using a sound pressure level meter. The ambient noise level of the room measured at 59.3 decibels, with a fan running and someone cooking in the other room. We held the meter at ear level while running each vacuum to gauge the noise exposure while actually using the vacuum.</p>
<p>The average noise level of our finalists was 79 dBA, when the vacuums were used at their highest setting. Comparatively, it’s the <a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/loud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sound of a freight train</a> from 100 feet away. Our loudest vacuum, the Oreck, was closer to the sound levels of a boiler room at 88.6 dBA. The Eureka was the quietest vacuum, measuring 71.3 dBA, or a little louder than classroom chatter. The Shark had a wide range of noise levels, from 83.5 dBA on its max setting to just below the average noise level at 77.2 dBA on its lowest setting.</p>

<p>In our tests, we found the vacuums with better suction tended to be harder to move around the floor. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUKHACW/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Rocket HV302</a> is the exception; the power and the motorized brush roll work together to make it feel as though it is self-propelled. Swivel steering adds even greater agility, making the Shark easy to navigate around furniture. The combination of power and maneuverability made the Shark our top choice for a lightweight vacuum.</p>
<p>The Shark doesn’t snowplow large debris and is excellent at pulling up dirt and debris from along wall edges. The filter is simple to reach and remove using a flip-top lid and the waste canister is easy to empty. It has a 30-foot cord, so it’s easy to reach across the room and even down the hallway, depending on the size of your rooms.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t have a HEPA filter, the Shark performed on par with the Dyson in terms of emissions (and the Dyson is priced three times higher). It lowered both the large particle count and small particle count in the room after vacuuming. It pulled up sand and fine debris in large amounts, impressing us with how clean the floor looked after vacuuming with the Shark.</p>

It glides smoothly across carpet and easily navigates around furniture and against wall edges.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUKHACW/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The motorized brush roll helps to agitate dirt from carpets, while the included Hard Floor Hero head serves to pick up surface litter and stuck-on food or dirt. So you have the option to adjust the height with a switch and keep vacuuming across different floor types or change out the vacuum head.</p>
<p>This model converts into a hand vacuum with a dusting brush, upholstery brush and crevice tool. It also comes with a car-detail kit with micro tools for detailing your automobile.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>As powerful as the Shark is, it didn’t fare well in our pet hair test. For a better option, see our review on <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">vacuums for pet hair</a>. In fact, the power may have been part of the problem. It sucked up so much pet hair at one time that within 30 seconds the filter was too clogged to retain any more debris.</p>
<p>The other downside is that it is one of the heavier finalists we tested. Although it only weighs eight pounds, the majority of the weight is in the handheld portion of the vacuum. It may not be the best choice for you if your wrist is easily strained. Because it is so top heavy, it also doesn’t stand up on its own.</p>
<p>However, you can mount it on the included wall bracket for storage. You can also detach the hand vac from the floor mount and place it on the hook above the floor nozzle for easy storage.</p>
<p>These considerations aside, the Shark has enough pros that we feel comfortable recommending it as our top choice for a corded lightweight vacuum.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Shark &#8211; Rocket HV302 is easy to use and maneuver, as the combination of strong suction and a motorized brush head reduces the force needed to push the vacuum.</li>
<li>Swivel steering makes vacuuming around furniture effortless, and a low profile allows you to reach under couches easily.</li>
<li>Our air was cleaner after vacuuming with the Shark, as its tightly sealed system and effective filter trapped fine and larger dust particles while running.</li>
<li>This model may not be the best choice for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">pet owners</a>, as pet hair tends to clog in the filter and reduce efficacy.</li>

<p>Priced lower than average, especially for a cordless model, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNJ7ZR1/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEC222</a> is well worth the investment of a high-end vacuum. It is quiet but powerful and swivel steering makes it a breeze to move around the room. The low profile makes it a snap to clean underneath furniture, while its agility makes it easy to get around large pieces.</p>
<p>The Eureka aced our performance test, picking up as many grams of dirt as the Dyson and pulling up embedded pet hair without clogging. While it didn’t clean the air in our emissions test, it also retained any large or fine debris it pulled up from the carpet so you don’t have to worry about dust kickback.</p>
<p>It has the brightest front headlights, making it easy to see in low lighting. The waste canister empties at the touch of a button; there’s also a second option to twist off the collection cup.</p>

Paired with a quiet but powerful motor, this model handily won our pick for best lightweight cordless.</p><a href="" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The things we liked most about this vacuum were its performance on both pet hair and fine dust and its quiet motor. The Eureka is only 6.5 pounds, so despite the motor being located at the handle, it didn’t put any pressure on our wrist.</p>
<p>The vacuum converts into a hand vac and comes with a crevice tool and a two-in-one upholstery tool. It has a solid 30 minutes of run time and charges in four hours.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>Our main concern with the Eureka is that the controls aren’t easily decipherable, so it’s hard to determine which symbol means carpet and which means hard floors (without consulting the manual, and let’s face it, we all know those end up in a junk drawer and are rarely consulted).</p>
<p>A secondary issue is that the brush head tends to lift off the ground, so it doesn’t always make full contact with the floor. This could mean it doesn’t pick up as much as it should or that you have to make multiple passes over the same area, unless you are actively ensuring that it fully engages with the carpet or hard flooring.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Eureka &#8211; NEC222 is reasonably priced for a lightweight cordless vacuum and well worth the expense.</li>
<li>If you want a lightweight cordless vacuum that rivals the Dyson in terms of performance and doesn’t kick back any dust, the Eureka is an excellent choice.</li>
<li>At 6.5 pounds, it’s so lightweight that the brush head tends to lift off the carpet, but it doesn’t cause any arm fatigue after a long period of vacuuming.</li>
<li>Despite being a powerful vacuum, the Eureka is one of the quietest models we tested.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZYPZ0I/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hoover &#8211; SH20030</a> wasn’t the absolute lowest-priced model we tested. However, of our eight finalists, it’s the best performing vacuum on the lower end of the price spectrum. It easily picked up pet hair and cereal in our performance test, and we especially liked that it could pick up debris along the edges of walls (thanks to edge cleaning bristles on the brush roll). It doesn’t deep clean as well as our other top picks, but it would be an excellent second vacuum for a quick pick up.</p>
<p>It runs smoothly on hard floors and doesn’t snowplow large debris, and you can easily transition between flooring types with a flick of the switch. It has a low profile and reaches under furniture with no problem. The swivel steering is useful for navigating around furniture and getting close to the edges.</p>

You may want to opt for a more heavy-duty vacuum to deep clean your carpets occasionally, but the Hoover will keep your room tidy and free of pet hair.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZYPZ0I/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Weighing only eight pounds, the weight is evenly distributed, so it’s easier to handle than our top-heavy cordless vacuums. Its 20-foot cord is long enough to reach across most rooms.</p>
<p>We also like that the Hoover is on the quieter side at only 75.9 dBA, less than our average rating of 79.4 across all models we tested. It’s also slim and stores upright, which makes it convenient to keep close at hand for those quick pick-up jobs.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>The Hoover performs better picking up large debris than fine dust. It’s a good choice for a lightweight, everyday vacuum,, but if you’re looking for a vacuum that really deep cleans, you may want to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>It doesn’t spew out fine particles (perhaps because it doesn’t pull them out of the carpet in the first place), but it does have trouble retaining large particles. If you have allergies or breathing issues, you may want to upgrade to a model with a more tightly sealed system.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Hoover &#8211; SH20030 has a powered brush roll and edge-cleaning bristles, so it performs best on pet hair and along wall edges.</li>
<li>At less than half the price of our average for all the lightweight vacuums we tested, the Hoover is the best bang for your buck.</li>
<li>Swivel steering and a low profile makes this vacuum incredibly easy to operate, while its upright position makes it trouble-free to pause between tasks.</li>
<li>If you have allergies or asthma, you may want to opt for a more expensive model that has fewer emissions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>Dyson &#8211; V10 Absolute</h3>
<p>If you want a luxury upgrade, we highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0798FVV6V/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; V10 Absolute</a>. The price point is more than double the average cost of our vacuums, but every Dyson we have tested (including the V10 Absolute) outperforms the other finalists in terms of performance and air quality.</p>
<p>We didn’t name it our winner simply because it isn’t as easy to maneuver as our top picks, and we considered agility a top priority for a lightweight vacuum. The price point is higher than many consumers are able or willing to spend. Finally, we noted that the hygenic one-touch emptying bin tends to stick, making it more likely to spill the contents. (This wasn’t an issue with other Dyson models we previously tested.)</p>
<p>However, if you have pets or allergies, it may be worth it to invest in a Dyson for its ability to capture and retain both pet hair and dander. Dyson cord-free vacuums have whole machine filtration which captures 99 percent of particles as small as 0.3 microns.</p>
<h3>Oreck &#8211; XL2100RHS</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NDNV18/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oreck &#8211; XL2100RHS</a> is a bagged, corded and commercial model that performs extremely well in terms of pulling up embedded dirt and debris from carpet. It has plenty of power, but it’s also the noisiest vacuum of the models we tested. It also tends to drag along the floor and doesn’t have swivel steering, so alhough it weighs the same as the Shark, it causes arm fatigue, and the Shark doesn’t.</p>
<p>If you want a powerhouse vacuum and your main reason for choosing a lightweight vacuum is the ability to carry it upstairs easily, the Oreck is a good choice. However, if you have allergies or asthma, the trail of dust it leaves behind may make the Oreck a poor choice for you.</p>
<h3>Tineco &#8211; A11 Hero</h3>
<p>If maneuverability is what you prize most, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FFKYCRL/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tineco &#8211; A11 Hero</a> is hands down the most agile vacuum we tested. Unfortunately, it doesn’t possess the suction power to name it as our top cordless pick. It only picked up four grams of dirt in our performance test, and appeared to pick up large debris well (with no snow plowing), but would leave pieces behind after we turned off the suction.</p>
<p>It comes with two lithium-ion batteries and a dual charging dock, so you can run the vacuum for up to 60 minutes without interruption. The waste canister is easy to empty, and it is easy on the wrist at only 5.5 pounds, despite being top heavy.</p>
<h3>Deik &#8211; ZB1516</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FGRZJ29/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deik &#8211; ZB1516</a> has swivel steering, but the brush head doesn’t move as easily as our other contenders with swivel steering. Although it’s a top-heavy model like most of our lightweight cordless vacuums, the Deik weighs only 4.7 pounds so you don’t feel strain on the wrist.</p>
<p>It has a HEPA filter, but it tested as one of the neutral models in our emissions test. It doesn’t leave the air cleaner like the Shark or Dyson, but it doesn’t kick back dust either. Our overall impression of the Deik is neutral. At just over half the price of the average cost of our finalists, there isn’t anything negative about this vacuum, but it doesn’t have many standout qualities either.</p>
<h3>Bissell &#8211; Featherweight 2033</h3>
<p>If you need the absolute lightest vacuum for quick pick ups, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZY7BTWM/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; Featherweight 2033</a> is a decent option. It lies flat so you can get underneath furniture easily, although the head doesn’t swivel so it doesn’t navigate as well as other finalists. However, at only 3 pounds, maneuverability isn’t as much of an issue as it would be for heavier vacuums.</p>
<p>The short cord could be problematic if you have a larger area room, and the filter clogs easily with pet hair. For the price and weight, these issues may not be deal breakers. The Bissell is the lowest-priced model we tested, and although it doesn’t come with any bells or whistles or have much power, it will make your floor appear cleaner with minimal effort.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>When looking for the best lightweight vacuum, we wanted to find a model that was agile as well as lightweight. Whether you’re purchasing a lightweight vacuum because you have a higher area of square footage, multiple floors or a limited range of motion, a vacuum that maneuvers easily will make the task less labor-intensive.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUKHACW/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Rocket HV302</a> has tremendous capabilities to capture and retain dust and debris, while still being easy to navigate around the room. For those who prefer a cordless model, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNJ7ZR1/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEC222</a> is another lightweight vacuum that combines power with ease of use.</p>

<h2 id="compare">Compare the best gas grills</h2>
[table id=290 /]
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected gas grills to test</h2>
<p>Many manufacturers of gas grills frequently update or improve their models, so we looked for gas grills that would not likely be replaced in a couple of years. Although these upgrades are often minor, we focused on grills that manufacturers had released in 2018-2019.</p>
<p>If you have a couple thousand in expendable cash, you could plunk it down on a high-end <a href="https://www.napoleon.com/en/us/grills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Napoleon</a>, which has years’-long warranties. A Napoleon, however, may be out of the average consumer’s price range, so we instead we researched the moderately expensive Webers, one of the leaders in the industry.</p>
<p>Weber has several series of gas and charcoal grills — each with a lofty name, like Summit, Genesis and Master-Touch — and we chose to test the Spirit II, since its features are similar to less-expensive brands.</p>
<p>Our tester then personally checked out all of the grills sold at Home Depot and Lowe’s, and since we wanted an equitable test, we selected grills that we believed would be a fair match against the Weber. (For the record, we also considered grills sold at Target, but the selection only included older models.)</p>
<p>To be comparable with the Weber, the grills needed to have at least three burners, two side shelves, approximately the same size cook space (475 square inches) and at least 30,000 BTUs. (If you want to know more about BTUs — British Thermal Units — and their importance, check out our review of the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-portable-air-conditioner/#btucalculator">best portable air conditioner</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, we kept to a budget of no more than $300 each for the other two finalists. Models with cabinets are more expensive, so we chose models that had carts instead. Both the Char-Broil Performance and <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dyna-Glo-4-Burner-Open-Cart-LP-Gas-Grill-in-Black-DGF493PNP-D/302774519" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyna-Glo</a> are highly rated by consumers and are available in two to five-burner models. Oddly, Char-Broil’s price decreases with the larger models, and we chose the five-burner for a very reasonable $199 and the comparably priced four-burner Dyna-Glo.</p>
<h2 id="assemble">Assembling a gas grill</h2>
<p>First off, if there’s an offer (from whichever store you purchased the grill) for free assembly, grab it. Unless you really enjoy building things from nuts and bolts, be forewarned that assembling a gas grill requires two people and two hours of time. Lowe’s sells the Char-Broil fully assembled, so we paid the service charge for its delivery. Amazon usually charges for assembly, but for the Weber, it was free at the time we purchased it. However, since this service might not be available in your location, we decided to assemble the Weber and the Dyna-Glo ourselves to compare difficulty.</p>
<p>The Weber’s shipping weight is 116 pounds, and even with two people, it would be back-breaking to lift and carry the boxed Weber from the driveway to the backyard. So we unpacked and constructed it in the driveway. Although all of the pieces and hardware looked like we were about to put the disassembled Tin Woodsman back together, the Weber’s instructions were detailed and specific. Tools were required (not included), but everything fit perfectly into position.</p>
<p>Assembling the Dyna-Glo was a completely different experience. It weighs less than 65 pounds, because its materials are so much less substantial. The Dyna-Glo’s hood was encased in styrofoam for shipping, but it was dented in several spots. Metal splinters came off its side panels, and its framework was so flimsy, we worried it would not support the grill box. Surprisingly, it held, but the Dyna-Glo’s sturdiness didn’t compare well with the Weber’s.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Each grill had an igniter button, and following their manual’s lighting instructions, we preheated the grills to 500°F, which took between 10-15 minutes. We then cooked hamburgers, steak and chicken on each grill in the same way.</p>
<h3>Hamburgers</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23814" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-810x540.jpg 810w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flippin-burgers-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We put four beef hamburgers on each quadrant of the cooking grate to determine whether the grill was hotter in the back, sides or front. We seared the burgers for three minutes, turned them and using a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">digital meat thermometer</a>, cooked them to medium-rare, between 140°F and 145°F. We let the burgers rest five minutes before cutting into them.</p>
<h3>Steak</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23812" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-810x540.jpg 810w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Next, we heated the grills back up to 500°F (there was always heat loss when the grill hoods were opened) and seared one-inch-thick New York strip steaks (seasoned only with Kosher salt and black pepper) on both sides for three minutes. We then lowered the heat and continued to cook them, turning frequently, until the digital meat thermometer hit 135°F. We took the steaks off the grill and allowed them to rest 10 minutes before cutting into them.</p>

<p>We spatchcocked a whole chicken, cut it in half and seasoned each half with Kosher salt and black pepper. Then we turned off two or four burners, depending on how many burners each grill had, and cooked the chicken with indirect heat by putting the chicken on the unlit burners for 30 minutes. When the leg and thigh were cooked through, we transferred the chicken to the lit burner and crisped up the skin until it was golden brown.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Char-Broil-Performance-Black-And-Stainless-5-Burner-Liquid-Propane-Gas-Grill-with-1-Side-Burner/1000523547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Char-Broil &#8211; Performance &#8211; 463347519</a> five-burner gas grill that we tested had a couple of minor design flaws, but otherwise it grilled everything virtually the same as our upgrade pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weber Spirit II &#8211; E-310</a>, and actually bested the Weber in our steak competition with a better sear. At only $199, it’s a fantastic value for this well-made and sturdy grill that we believe will last you several grilling seasons.</p>
<p>Let’s get the design flaws out of the way. Its temperature gauge is located on top of the hood, so we couldn’t easily see the temperature without getting closer and looking directly down at the gauge. Second, the hood has a stainless steel handle that gets searingly hot when grabbed near the curvature close to the lid.</p>
<p>Physically, the Char-Broil has some of the same features as the Weber: porcelain-coated cast-iron cooking grates, recessed porcelain-coated flame tamers — which vaporize grease and force excess grease to drip below — and a tapered drip pan that funnels grease to a small tray underneath the fire box.</p>
<p>The Char-Broil took five minutes longer to heat up than the Weber and Dyna-Glo, but when it hit 500°F, it maintained that temperature and distributed the heat evenly throughout its 475-square-inch cooking space.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with grilling, then you know it’s vital to monitor how quickly food is cooking and, if necessary, adjust the heat or move food to the upper rack so it doesn’t burn. We didn’t need to do either with the Char-Broil. The heat stayed consistent, and there were no flare-ups or hot spots. It wasn’t quite “set-it-and-forget-it” cooking, but it was definitely stress-free.</p>

<p>The hamburger we placed in the rear of the cooking space cooked a little faster than the burger in the front, but we simply switched them, and they finished at the same time as the burgers on the sides. The indirect-heat method worked very well with the chicken, which was cooked through and juicy. The steak was a wonder: It seared beautifully, and the fat crisped to a delicious golden brown.</p>

<p>The five-burner Char-Broil also has a side burner with 10,000 BTUs, which can be used for sauteing onions or peppers or making a pan sauce for your grilled meats and vegetables. It measures 53 inches wide and 26 inches deep, so if it’s too large for your patio, the Char-Broil &#8211; Performance is also available in several sizes and styles, like a compact <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HID4Y7Q/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">two-burner with cabinet</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZV24HV/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a stainless steel four-burner, cart-style</a> (like the model we tested), and for $400, a <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Char-Broil-Performance-Stainless-6-Burner-Liquid-Propane-Gas-Grill-with-1-Side-Burner/1000713050" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six-burner with side burner</a> and a 15,000 BTU sear burner.</p>
<p>If you’re considering buying a Weber, but you can’t justify its high price, the Char-Broil &#8211; Performance is an excellent, more affordable option.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Char-Broil &#8211; Performance- 463347519 is a well-made and sturdy propane-gas grill with some of the same features as a comparable Weber, but it’s half the price.</li>
<li>It maintained and evenly distributed heat over its entire 475-square-inch cooking area during our tests.</li>
<li>The Char-Broil &#8211; Performance seared steak and burgers to perfection and slow-cooked chicken so it had juicy meat and crispy skin.</li>
<li>A couple of minor design flaws — a misplaced temperature gauge, for one — aren’t deal-breakers.</li>

<p>On grill forums, diehard Weber fans state that any Weber — charcoal or gas — is the best grill money can buy. Other people, however, question why Webers are much more expensive than other grills. We were intrigued as to what made a Weber grill so special.</p>
<p>We selected the moderately expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weber Spirit II &#8211; E-310</a> to test, and its performance was excellent, but it did not surpass the Char-Broil. Weber’s build quality, however, can’t be beat, so if you can afford a Weber — and the latest models with infrared are pretty pricey — then we can easily recommend the Weber Spirit II &#8211; E-310 as our upgrade pick.</p>
<p>Free assembly was offered when we bought on Amazon, but if it’s not available where you live, or if you really want to get a sense of how well a Weber is constructed, try assembling it yourself. A Weber’s parts and materials are hefty, and even when we had it together, rolling it to the patio was like pushing a wheelbarrow of bricks. Our advice is to build it where it will live.</p>
<p>Weber aggressively markets their patented GS4 technology, consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infinity Ignition, which Weber guarantees will light every time</li>
<li>Flavorizer bars, similar to Char-Broil’s flame tamers</li>
<li>Tapered burners, which heat evenly across the entire 529-square-inch cooking space</li>
<li>Grease-management system, again similar to Char-Broil’s, in which a tapered pan forces the grease to drip into a tray with a replaceable foil inset.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Spirit also has a unique device that attaches to the propane tank and indicates the level of propane gas inside the tank. The temperature gauge is located on the front of the hood, so it’s easy to see the grill’s internal temperature (when the lid is closed) even from across the patio.</p>
<p>The Spirit heats up fast and maintains the temperature, until the hood is opened to flip or turn the food you’re grilling. Each time we lifted the hood, the grill’s internal temperature dropped 100 degrees. Once the hood was closed again, the grill rapidly reheated.</p>

But you’re paying for superb construction and high-end technology that deliver excellent cooking results. If durability, design and performance are what you expect from a grill, then the Weber Spirit II is for you.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>There was almost no difference between the Spirit and the Char-Broil in cooking results. We did notice, however, that the Spirit was slightly hotter in the back of the grill and less hot on the left side. We accommodated this discrepancy by shifting food towards the center or far right, when we wanted to sear the steak.</p>
<p>Overall, we were impressed by the Spirit’s design and can understand why Webers have a passionate following. The Spirit — and all Weber models — are built to last in most climates, and anecdotally, its devotees claim their Webers are still going strong after ten years, which is remarkable, considering many grills collapse into rust when exposed to the elements for a year or two.</p>
<p>The Spirit II series is also available in the same price range as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTFDG7/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">red two-burner</a>, and for $150 more, a sleek and modernistic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0098HR1FI/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">black three-burner</a> with a cabinet.</p>
<p>Weber’s new Genesis II series is nearly double the price of the Spirit II series for a three-burner grill, but its additional features include a side burner, stainless-steel grates (instead of porcelain-enameled) and Weber&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H6193C8/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iGrill 3 smart technology</a> that allows you to monitor the grill&#8217;s internal temperature with an app.</p>
<p>For its durability, design and performance, we think the Weber is worth the high price tag.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s expensive, but the Weber Spirit II &#8211; E310’s build quality and technology make this grill a clear upgrade from other starter models.</li>
<li>Weber’s advanced GS4 grill system includes an igniter that’s guaranteed to light every time, even heat distribution, grease management to prevent flare-ups and an indicator that shows the level of propane remaining in your tank.</li>
<li>The Spirit II &#8211; E310, like all Webers, is a heavy-duty grill designed to last for decades in most climates.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dyna-Glo-4-Burner-Open-Cart-LP-Gas-Grill-in-Black-DGF493PNP-D/302774519" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyna-Glo &#8211; DGF493PNP-D</a> four-burner gas grill is only $20 less than the Char-Broil &#8211; Performance, but the difference in build quality and performance was noticeable. The Dyna-Glo is a popular grill sold by Home Depot, but in reading online reviews, it’s clear that people are buying it for a single season and hoping it will last through the winter to maybe get a second summer out of it. That’s a fair assessment; its lightweight and cheaply finished materials would soon rust if the grill was left outside in the rain and snow.</p>
<p>During our testing, we had frequent grease flare-ups, which upon inspection, were caused by the Dyna-Glo’s flame tamers: they’re too narrow and positioned directly under the cooking grate. Consequently grease drips off the cooking food onto the burners rather than the bottom of the firebox. We needed to keep a close watch that the sudden bursts of flame didn’t burn everything we were grilling.</p>
<p>The back of the grill was much hotter than the front, so we continually re-positioned the food to prevent it from overcooking. Overall, grilling on the Dyna-Glo was more hands-on and a less pleasant experience than it was with the Char-Broil and Weber. If you’re looking for an inexpensive grill, we recommend the far superior Char-Broil &#8211; Performance instead.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you’re new to grilling or you’re looking to replace the grill you have, we recommend the <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Char-Broil-Performance-Black-And-Stainless-5-Burner-Liquid-Propane-Gas-Grill-with-1-Side-Burner/1000523547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Char-Broil &#8211; Performance</a> series as the best gas grill for the money. We tested the five-burner, but the Char-Broil Performance is available in other sizes to suit your needs or space requirements.</p>
<p>It’s sturdily made, heats and cooks evenly and makes it easy to grill like a pro,</p>
<p>If you want to upgrade, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weber Spirit II &#8211; E310</a> lives up to the company’s storied reputation. Like all Weber grills — both charcoal and propane gas — the Spirit is heavy-duty and built to last. Its high-end infinity ignition system, evenly distributed heat and grease management are worth the splurge if you grill everyday.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We scoured through consumer reviews on Amazon to find out what people like or dislike about the meat slicer they bought and how they use it. Almost everyone cites the expense of buying cold cuts at a deli counter or prepackaged in a supermarket as the reason for purchasing a meat slicer for home. Not only is a meat slicer great for slicing home-roasted meats, but many people also use one for cutting paper-thin slices of meat and then making jerky in a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-food-dehydrator/">food dehydrator like those we reviewed</a>.</p>
<p>Meat slicers for the home are about one-fifth the size of a professional meat slicer, but there are limitations to the size of the meat and cheese you want to slice. For example, all of the slicers we tested could handle a slab of roast beef about 8-inches in length but not more than 4.5-inches thick. So, they’re really not intended for bulk quantities, unless you cut the meat or cheese into several chunks and slice them one at a time.</p>
<p>The meat slicers you find on Amazon and elsewhere have the same 7.5-inch, circular serrated blade. A few larger models are available, but we decided to stick with the regular size with the 7.5-inch blade. The blades for all of the meat slicers we tested were made of stainless steel, which guarantees them a long life without getting dull.</p>

[table id=277 /]
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>When you shop for a meat slicer, you’ll notice that they pretty much look identical. Each meat slicer will have a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metal (or metal and plastic) chassis that houses the motor</li>
<li>Circular, serrated blade that fits into a central hub</li>
<li>Adjustable-thickness control knob</li>
<li>Sliding carriage for pushing food through the blade</li>
<li>Safety guard for preventing injury</li>
<li>Non-slip feet</li>
</ul>
<p>The best meat slicers, however, have a few subtle differences that you should look for.</p>
<p><b>Blade lock: </b>The serrated circular blade should lock and unlock into the center hub without your having to touch the blade itself. The blade should have a recessed handle that pops in and out when you’re removing the blade or reinserting it into the hub. A meat slicer’s blade is murderously sharp, and the lock’s handle will prevent your being cut.</p>
<p><b>Blade recess: </b>All slicers have a knob to adjust thickness from zero to 15 millimeters (½ inch). When the knob is at zero, the blade should be completely recessed in its casing; otherwise, it’s easy to nick your fingers when you’re storing the slicer away. Two of the meat slicers we tested had recessed blades when their adjustment knobs were at zero; the other meat slicers did not, so their blades were slightly exposed even at zero.</p>
<p><b>Removable carriage</b>: Bits of food get stuck in between the blade and its casing, so the slicer needs to be thoroughly cleaned after every use. If the carriage is removable, you’ll have better access to safely clean the recesses where food is trapped.</p>

<p>Since slicing meat and cheese is what a meat slicer is intended for, we selected hard salami, roast beef and a semi-soft cheese. Unless its motor is weak (none of the finalists we tested were), it’s relatively easy for a meat slicer to cut thick slices. However, to really make a deli-style sandwich, the meats and cheese should be cut very thin. So for each slicer, we attempted to get a slice at one millimeter, its lowest setting.</p>
<p>We also checked the slicer’s safety features and whether or not it was user-friendly. Finally, after all the slicing, we tested how easy the slicers were to clean and store away.</p>

<p>Not only does the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IW22Z6E/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; FS-75</a> cut tissue-paper-thin slices, it also has several safety and ergonomic features that none of the other meat slicers we tested has.</p>
<p>If you’ve never worked with a meat slicer before, it may be a bit intimidating at first. The circular blade looks like a mini buzzsaw, and it really is as sharp as it looks. So it was reassuring that when we unpacked the Cuisinart, its blade was completely recessed into the blade’s casing. The Cuisinart’s slice control knob is set at a true zero, which guarantees practically zero chance of injury when you&#8217;re storing it.</p>
<p>The knob is also ergonomically designed. Its unusual comma shape does two things. First, your thumb fits into the curve, which allows for a precise adjustment of cut size. Also, the knob moves <i>away </i>from the blade — rather than towards it, like most of the other slicers’ knobs do — so it’s safe as well.</p>
<p>Performance was excellent. We experimented with the thinnest setting, and the cheese and salami were sliced as perfectly as you’d see on a restaurant’s charcuterie board. The roast beef shredded a bit, so we increased the cut size to the next thickness (1/16 inch), and it stayed intact.</p>

Ergonomically designed with safety features to prevent injury that most of the other slicers we tested didn’t have, the Cuisinart handily made our top pick.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IW22Z6E/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Clean-up of any meat slicer is always a pain, but it’s easier with the Cuisinart. It’s the only slicer with a removable carriage, which pops out and back in, and allows you to clean crevices underneath. The Cuisinart also has a nifty recessed handle in the center of the blade. You push a button, and a small handle pops out, which then allows you to lift out the blade without touching its edges.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart is about the same price as the other slicers we tested. We found it to be the easiest to operate, and with the thoughtful design and safety features, we recommend the Cuisinart as the best meat slicer.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; FS-75 consistently sliced razor-thin meats and cheese for deli-style sandwiches or a gourmet charcuterie board at home.</li>
<li>Its additional safety features protect fingers and hands from the blade.</li>
<li>With its removable sliding carriage, the Cuisinart was the easiest to clean.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart is similarly priced to other meat slicers, but it&#8217;s better made.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UDN75QQ/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arksen &#8211; A-048-GM-48087</a> meat slicer performed almost as well as the Cuisinart. It’s also the only other slicer we tested that had a true-zero adjustment setting, so the blade is recessed in its casing. Similar to the Cuisinart, the Arksen has a curved adjustment knob that turns away from the blade. Initially we found the knob stiff to turn, but after repeated use, it was easier to adjust.</p>
<p>The Arksen sliced everything very well, but it was particularly good with cheese. At its lowest setting, it sliced cheese so thinly and evenly, the slice was transparent when we held it up to the light. Salami was also sliced paper-thin. The roast beef didn’t slice quite as thinly, but when we increased the thickness to the next level (1/16 inch), the slices came out evenly cut.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UDN75QQ/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="" data-srcset="" width="" height="" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Cheese Boards: Arksen</h3><p>The Arksen slices meats very thinly, but it really excels in evenly slicing cheese at varying thicknesses, which makes it ideal for a cheese board of hard and semi-soft cheeses.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UDN75QQ/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The only thing we didn’t like about the Arksen is, like the other slicers — except the Cuisinart — a viscous white lubricant has been injected into the blade casing to keep the blade running smoothly. Instructions state that the (hopefully food-grade) lubricant should not be washed off. But it&#8217;s unavoidable when you need to properly clean the blade, and the lubricant smears both the inner and outer sides of the blade with a greasy film that’s difficult to remove.</p>
<p>The Arksen frequently makes “best of” lists, and we can see why. It’s a well-crafted slicer that’s lightweight, user-friendly and affordable.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Arksen &#8211; A-048-GM-48087 can slice just about everything at the thinnest cut.</li>
<li>It has a couple of the safety features that our top pick Cuisinart has for protecting fingers and hands from getting nicked by the sharp blade.</li>
<li>The lubricant in the blade casing tends to smear when you’re trying to clean the blade.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gourmia &#8211; GFS700</h3>
<p>It took some trial and error to get an even slice out of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017HX1D8K/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gourmia &#8211; GFS700</a>. The thickness-adjustment knob, which needs to be turned <i>toward</i> the blade rather than away, doesn’t have the accuracy that the Cuisinart and Arksen had. The salami sliced well, but we couldn’t get the cheese to slice thinner than 1/16-inch without falling apart. Roast beef shredded until we increased the thickness to ¼-inch.</p>
<p>Removal and reinsertion of the blade was also challenging. The blade connects to the hub with a plastic screw. Once it was removed, we had to pry the blade out of the casing, increasing the chances of injury. To put the blade back into the casing, the plastic screw needed to be perfectly aligned or the blade jammed.</p>
<h3>Chefman &#8211; RJ49-CA</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CT5TVTX/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chefman &#8211; RJ49-CA</a>’s chassis and casing are made of die-cast metal, so it looks and feels like it’s well-constructed. The Chefman has an almost identical blade and blade lock as the Cuisinart, but that’s where the favorable comparison ends. The Chefman doesn’t have a true-zero setting, so the blade is always exposed in storage. The markings on the adjustment knob are in a reverse direction, so we couldn’t see what thickness we adjusted it to, which means we had to eyeball the thickness as we sliced. Even when we set the Chefman to the thinnest cut, it sliced everything too thick.</p>
<h3>Elite Platinum &#8211; EMT-625B</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D7TFTVN/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elite Platinum &#8211; EMT-625B</a> was certainly the loudest slicer we tested, and if you’re bothered by the sound of a buzzsaw, this slicer isn’t for you. Although it has the Cuisinart’s blade lock, the Elite has the same problems as the Chefman: greasy lubricant in the blade casing and on the blade, adjustment settings in reverse and difficulty in getting a thickness less than ¼-inch.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you crave a deli sandwich and don’t want to fuss slicing meat and cheese with a knife, then a meat slicer will save you time, frustration and money. A meat slicer is also great for thinly slicing vegetables, and if you’re a fan of a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-bread-machine/">bread machine</a>, many consumers even slice perfect slices of home-made bread with one.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IW22Z6E/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; FS-75</a> is about the same price as the other meat slicers we tested, but it was the easiest to use and consistently cut even and super-thin slices of meat and cheese. Added to its excellent performance are the safety features that help prevent injury from the efficient, razor-sharp blade.</p>

<h2 id="why-buy">Why buy a KitchenAid stand mixer?</h2>
<p>Simply put, it’s the best. We rigorously <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stand-mixer/">tested five highly rated stand mixers</a>, and the KitchenAid Artisan was the clear champion over the others. If you’re a daily baker or a holiday baker, any KitchenAid stand mixer is an essential appliance for your kitchen.</p>
<p>All KitchenAid stand mixers combine heavy-duty steel construction with a powerful motor. Depending on its size and wattage, a KitchenAid makes short work of any tedious baking task, such as blending thick cookie dough stuffed with mix-ins or kneading pizza dough.</p>
<p>Any KitchenAid stand mixer has been built to last a lifetime. We’ve worked with the KitchenAid Pro 600 for nearly 15 years, and it’s still churning out and humming along as well as the first day we flipped the on switch.</p>
<p>These are workhorses; and like the proverbial workhorse, they’re solid and heavy. The Artisan and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SGFW/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Classic </a> — both are the compact, tilt-head style —  weigh in at 23 pounds. The Professional is a hefty 29 pounds. So you really need to have some kitchen-counter real estate where the KitchenAid can live, since it’s too heavy to hoist it up to a cabinet.</p>

<p>All KitchenAid stand mixers have a unique built-in that no other stand mixer has: a power hub. This portal on the mixer’s head allows you to plug in 15 attachments, ranging from a pasta roller to a spiralizer, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-spiralizer/">like the spiralizers we reviewed</a>, to an ice cream maker, one that&#8217;s smaller and just as functional as those we reviewed in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-ice-cream-maker/">best ice cream maker</a> article.</p>
<p>Finally, you’re probably aware that a KitchenAid stand mixer is more expensive than other stand mixers. You’ll spend between $200 to $325 on a KitchenAid stand mixer, but with all of the available attachments that can do practically any cooking-prep job, you’ll push your culinary skills to new levels.</p>

<p>KitchenAid has been manufacturing stand mixers for 100 years, and during that century, they’ve given several facelifts to their models. There are three core models that KitchenAid occasionally updates: the Classic, the Pro 600 and the Artisan. (KitchenAid also makes a very large Commercial mixer, but these are really intended for bakeries or home-baking businesses.)</p>
[table id=265 /]
<h3>Classic</h3>
<p>The Classic Series has a tilt-head design, meaning the head of the mixer swivels back, which allows easy access to the mixing bowl. The Classic’s mixing bowl is 4.5 quarts and has no handle. The bowl is slightly tapered and locks into the bottom of the mixer’s stand. The Classic has 10 variable speeds controlled by a side lever.</p>
<p>The Classic has 275 watts and is a planetary-motion mixer, which means the attachments revolve while the bowl remains stationary. Although the Classic’s wattage is somewhat less than the Artisan and Pro 600, all KitchenAid stand mixers have been engineered to use wattage for creating exceptional torque — the force needed to rotate an object — which is particularly needed for kneading bread or pizza dough and mixing dense cookie dough.</p>
<p>The Classic has 59 touch points per rotation; every time the wire whisk, dough hook or flat beater (included with all KitchenAid mixers) revolves around the bowl, it will touch the bowl 59 times. The more touch points per rotation, the less you will need to scrape the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>True to its name, the Classic is only available in two colors, white and silver.</p>
<h3>Artisan</h3>
<p>The Artisan has all of the same features of the Classic, but its power is boosted to 325 watts. The Artisan has a 5-quart tapered bowl with a handle that also locks into the stand. The same accessories are included, but the Artisan’s flat beater has a raised silicone edge, which virtually eliminates scraping the bowl. Like the Classic, the Artisan also has a 10-speed motor and 59 touch points per rotation.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to match your appliances with your kitchen, the Artisan comes in a veritable rainbow of 44 colors.</p>
<h3>Pro 600</h3>
<p>KitchenAid&#8217;s Pro 600 Series shares some core features with the Classic and Artisan models. It differs, however, in that it has a bowl-lift design. The 6-quart bowl latches onto two side arms and the back of the stand. A lever raises the bowl to the attachment; when mixing is complete, the bowl lowers back to the base.</p>
<p>The Pro 600 is also larger, heavier, and its wattage is amped up to 575. With 67 touch points per rotation, the wide whisk and flat beater (one-third larger than the Classic and Artisan) and the elongated dough hook miss nothing in the bowl.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Since we already tested the Artisan in our stand mixer review, we repeated the same tests with the Classic and Pro 600.</p>

<p><b>Egg whites:</b> For each mixer, we put two room-temperature egg whites into the bowl and started the mixer at its lowest setting. When the egg whites began to foam, we increased the speed to the highest level and timed how long it took for the egg whites to reach a meringue consistency.</p>

<p><b>Cream: </b>The Artisan easily whipped one cup of chilled heavy cream to fluffy peaks. We repeated the test with the Classic and Pro 600 by whipping the cream at its lowest setting and gradually increasing to the highest and timed how long it took for the mixer to whip the cream.</p>
<h3>Cake batter</h3>
<p>We used “The Great British Baking Show” judge <a href="https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/mary_berrys_perfect_34317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Berry’s recipe for genoise</a>, or sponge cake, which serves as the base for an assortment of iced and jelly-filled cakes. We made this recipe many times during our initial testing, and it’s especially good for showing how well (or poorly) the stand mixer whips the ingredients together to create a light and airy cake with a soft crumb.</p>
<h3>Cookie dough</h3>
<p>As we discovered from our prior tests, cookie dough can cause havoc with almost all stand mixers. Depending on the shape of the bowl and length of attachments, oftentimes mixins just aren’t mixed in enough. This failing was more than apparent with the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stand-mixer/">Cheftronic &#8211; SM986 and Cuisinart SM-50 </a>, both of which left mixins in the bottom of their deeply tapered bowls and short attachments.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/super-chunky-cookies-3362198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recipe </a> we used is a dense dough jammed full with chocolate chips, peanuts and M&amp;Ms. This test really showcases the motor’s ability to create the torque needed to thoroughly blend these heavy ingredients into a cohesive dough.</p>
<h3>Pizza dough</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kneading-dough.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>This is the most challenging test of all. It’s a <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/pizza-dough-recipe-1914764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard recipe for pizza dough</a> that we’ve made dozens of times. Earlier models of stand mixers had an extenuated dough hook that was curled like a pig’s tail. The latest models have dough hooks that are about one-third shorter and have a more traditional hook shape.</p>
<p>In our previous tests, only the Artisan blended and kneaded the dough effortlessly. The other mixers struggled to make a cohesive dough with the new dough hook, and the strain on their  motors caused the mixers to shake and rattle like the Northridge Earthquake.</p>

<p>The 5-quart, tilt-head <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PS Artisan</a> stand mixer won <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stand-mixer/#best">best overall in our review of stand mixers,</a> and it’s our top pick again. The Artisan is the most popular of KitchenAid’s stand mixers, and it’s easy to understand why. The Artisan is about 20 percent smaller than the Pro 600, and the tilt-head design makes the mixer more compact so it can fit underneath most kitchen cabinets.</p>
<p>At 375 watts, the Artisan has plenty of power to tackle bread, pizza and chunky cookie dough. The usual attachments are included: A wire whisk, flat paddle and dough hook. The flat paddle and dough hook are nylon-coated for easy cleaning.</p>
<p>We found the Artisan’s pouring shield especially useful when we added flour to the pizza dough. It fits over the mixing bowl and allows you to add dry or wet ingredients while the mixer is mixing. The pouring shield eliminated spills and concentrated the flour into a spout, which the dough hook efficiently turned into the vortex of the mixture.</p>

It’s fast, versatile and very user-friendly.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Artisan has a slightly tapered stainless steel bowl, and its attachments have been designed specifically to reduce the need for scraping ingredients down the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>The Artisan performed perfectly in all of our tests. It whipped the egg whites and cream to firm peaks in one minute and smoothly blended the cake batter, which baked light, airy and delicate. The Artisan had no problems mixing together the cookie dough, although there were a few M&amp;M bits in the bottom of the bowl. The hook attachment is less curlicue than the Pro 600’s, but the Artisan nevertheless mixed and kneaded an elastic ball of pizza dough in five minutes.</p>
<p>The Artisan is so easy to use you’ll find yourself baking like a professional in no time. Like all three KitchenAid stand mixers, the Artisan is expensive. But if you’re new to baking or you’re someone who wants to bake more than cupcakes and Christmas cookies, the Artisan is an investment you should make.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The KitchenAid Artisan is a tilt-head-style stand mixer and compact enough to fit under most kitchen cabinets.</li>
<li>The Artisan has plenty of power to handle dense bread and cookie dough.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s available in 44 colors, which you can match with other appliances and your kitchen&#8217;s design.</li>
<li>The Artisan is fast, easy to use and will inspire you to bake more.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re an ardent baker and an all-day baking binge is a regular past time, then the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Y5X9W/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; Pro 600 </a> is your best choice. It’s only about $50 more than the Artisan, but we feel the substantially increased power, rock-solid construction and excellent ease of use is worth that small difference in price.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the Pro 600 is a big piece of machinery. It’s made entirely of metal, so it’s quite heavy — 29 pounds — and once you’ve unpacked the Pro 600, it’s not going anywhere. Look elsewhere if your kitchen counter space is limited.</p>
<p>Like all KitchenAid stand mixers, the Pro 600’s 575-watt motor has direct drive transmission, which means that its system of (all-steel) gears directly transfers power to whatever you’re mixing in the bowl. There’s less power consumption, and it mixes everything faster.</p>
<p>The proof, of course, is in the pudding &#8212; or the cake batter. The Pro 600 beat the other two KitchenAid stand mixers by 15 to 20 seconds in every challenge, due, in part, to its wire whisk and flat paddle being one-third larger. When the bowl is lifted into place, the attachments touch the bottom of the bowl and the sides. With its 67 touch points, every last ounce of ingredient is whisked or beaten.</p>

<p>The results? Egg whites were beaten to meringue consistency in 55 seconds, the cream was fluffed to peaks in a minute. The cake baked light and airy with a delicate and moist crumb, and the cookies had a cake-like texture, which made us want to eat the entire batch in one sitting. (We restrained from doing so, barely.)</p>

<p>The Pro 600’s dough hook recalls what Captain Hook wore at his wrist. Its elongated, curlicue shape reaches the bottom of the bowl, so when we started the mixer at its lowest setting, the hook gently mixed the ingredients with no splatter. We increased the speed to 2 (there are 10 levels) and watched in amazement how the hook gathered everything together into a dough ball. Not once did we need to scrape the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>We increased the speed to 3 and allowed the mixer to do its work, kneading the pizza dough until it was smooth and elastic. It really doesn’t get easier. As we did in our prior tests — and you shouldn’t do this at home — we increased the speed to its highest level while the mixer was kneading the dough. The bowl vibrated, but the heavy-metal stand held its ground and stayed in place.</p>
<p>KitchenAid intuited that most people will not store the Pro 600 in a cabinet, and so they’ve designed them in 22 different shades to fit any kitchen’s color scheme. If you prefer a vintage look, a tempered-glass mixing bowl is available.</p>
<p>The Pro 600 is the most expensive of the three KitchenAid stand mixers. The Pro 600 won’t fit everyone’s budget, and if you don’t have spacious countertops, you should consider the Artisan instead.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The KitchenAid &#8211; Pro 600 is a sturdily constructed, high-power kitchen workhorse and makes short work of any baking mixing task.</li>
<li>Its 6-quart bowl allows you to make several loaves of bread or up to 13 dozen cookies in a single batch.</li>
<li>The Pro 600&#8217;s bowl and attachments are designed to virtually eliminate any hand-mixing or scraping of the bowl.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s the most expensive of the KitchenAid mixers we tested, but if you bake everyday, it&#8217;s a worthwhile investment. The Pro 600 is built to last for years.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SGFW/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; K45SS Classic</a> is the least expensive stand mixer in the KitchenAid line. It’s well-made and performed almost as well as the Artisan. However, in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stand-mixer/">review of stand mixers</a>, we recommended the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 63232</a> as an alternative to the Artisan. Since it’s about $25 less than the Classic and on a par with the Artisan, if you’re looking for a budget-priced stand mixer, consider the Hamilton Beach.</p>
<p>The Classic has 275 watts and at 4.5-quarts, its bowl is slightly smaller than the Artisan. It has the same attachments, but it lacks a splatter shield. (We checked KitchenAid’s website, and a separately purchased splatter shield for the Classic is not available.) In many respects, the Classic is identical to the Artisan; however, we did notice some minor differences in its performance.</p>
<p>The Classic whipped the egg whites and cream about 15 seconds slower, which is hardly a deal breaker. However, at its highest speed, the motor fluctuated and seemed to slow down for a second. We tested this several times, and the slight fluctuation was consistent. Since we only tested one model of the Classic, this issue might pertain only to the model we tested.</p>
<p>The Classic’s flat beater doesn’t have the silicone edge that the Artisan has, so it couldn’t reach all of the ingredients. This was the only KitchenAid mixer that made us scrape the bowl. We mixed ingredients thoroughly, but the cake rose unevenly with divets on the surface. Minor discrepancies can always happen in baking, but the cake’s texture was noticeably less airy and light.</p>
<p>The cookies mixed together quickly (42 seconds), but we couldn’t increase the speed past level 3 without the ingredients splattering. When we removed the dough, about one-quarter cup of M&amp;Ms were left behind in the bottom of the bowl. The pizza hook was just as effective as it was in the other models, and the Classic produced an elastic dough in a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>You really can’t go wrong buying a KitchenAid stand mixer. They’re solid, built to last and can perform heavy-duty mixing, blending, whipping and kneading in a few effortless minutes. For someone who enjoys baking on a weekly or even daily basis, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Y5X9W/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KP26M1X Pro 600</a> is your best bet for handling high-volume baking.</p>
<p>If you’re a first-time baker or a seasoned professional, the smaller, less-expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PS Artisan</a> has plenty of power for both daily and occasional baking. The Artisan matches the Pro 600’s performance, but its tilt-head design makes it more compact so it can fit many kitchen-counter spaces.</p>

<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by checking out websites that are devoted to pet care, such as Rover.com, and other websites that reviewed and made recommendations for the best pet hair vacuum. It soon became obvious that almost none state how they tested the vacuums, and most recommend vacuums for general purposes and not those specifically designed for the challenges posed by pet hair and dander.</p>
<p>We decided to focus on vacuums that either had a special pet hair attachment, such as a mechanized roller brush, or vacuums that were specially designed for vacuuming pet hair. Once we had assembled our list, we narrowed it down to the vacuums reviewed by Amazon consumers as the most effective, durable and easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="six-best">Compare the best vacuums for pet hair</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pet-vac-lineup-b.jpg" alt="lineup of tested pet hair vacuums" width="2000" height="1335" /><br />

<h2 id="who">Who needs a pet hair vacuum?</h2>
<p>Dog and cat owners can probably agree on one thing: their fur baby sheds constantly, and if you allow them on the furniture or in your bed, then you’ve got pet hair everywhere. Pets shed all year round, and many dog breeds have shedding seasons when they lose their top coats and thick undercoats all at once. If you don’t keep up with it, you’ll be suffocating in tumbleweeds of hair.</p>
<p>You could be conscientiously grooming your pet every day, but you’re not just dealing with hair; you’ve got to rid your living space of dander too. For people with allergies, those microscopic flecks of skin will make them miserable if the air is filled with dander. Air purifiers certainly help, but you need a vacuum that can simultaneously suction up pet hair and filter pet dander.</p>
<p>Vacuums, of course, come in many shapes, styles and sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upright bagless canister</li>
<li>Upright bagged canister</li>
<li><a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">Stick vacuum</a></li>
<li>Corded handheld</li>
<li>Cordless handheld</li>
<li>Robot vacuum</li>
</ul>
<p>The vacuum that will be most effective on pet hair will depend on the size of your home and whether you have carpet, hardwood floor or both.</p>
<p>Most vacuum manufacturers advertise that their product is best for pet hair, and some simply stamp a paw print icon on their product’s box to target pet owners. We learned from our research, however, that the differences between a regular vacuum and a vacuum for pet hair are actually pretty minimal.</p>
<p>In fact, when we compared handheld pet hair vacuums with the &#8220;regular&#8221; vacuums in <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">our handheld vacuums review</a>, we found that they were notably similar. A pet hair handheld vacuum may have an additional feature, such as a motorized beater-brush like our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07</a>, or a rubber comb, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>Manufacturers claim that a bagged canister vacuum is the most powerful for deep cleaning on a regular basis. But if you’re a pet owner who wants to vacuum every day, it doesn’t make sense to lug one of those around to every room and up and down stairs.</p>
<p>An upright bagless canister vacuum is lightweight, has great maneuverability and is easy to clean. It’s really the best and most convenient for vacuuming pet hair up from both carpeting and bare floor.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Cyclone separation technology:</b> You’ve probably read or heard about “cyclonic” vacuums. Dyson is the most famous vacuum that uses cyclone separation. (Check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/dyson-v7-trigger-vacuum/">Dyson review here.</a>) In brief, it’s a method for creating a rotating high-speed air flow, like a mini cyclone, that sucks everything up into the vacuum. The vortex inside the vacuum canister keeps the pet hair elevated and spinning. Dust and dander are then separated from the hair by centrifugal force and are trapped in an air filter.</p>
<p><b>Air filtration:</b> An air filtration system collects dust and dander from pet hair, and in some cases, freshens the air flowing through the vacuum’s exhaust vents. All upright canister vacuums have a filter made of sponge, foam or ridged fabric. The filters are easy to remove and clean by simply running them through water and squeezing them dry.</p>
<p>A HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter — found in many air purifiers — is often a secondary filter in a vacuum cleaner, and it traps virtually all airborne particles. Of the three upright canister vacuums we tested, only our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> had the additional HEPA filter.</p>
<p><b>Beater brush control:</b> The rotating brush — or beater brush — under an upright canister vacuum whisks up embedded dirt and debris from a carpet, which is then sucked into the canister. Beater brushes, however, are not effective on a hardwood floor, since they scatter more hair and dust than they actually brush up. Look for an upright canister vacuum that has a control to turn the beater brush on and off or raises and lowers it.</p>
<p><b>Special pet hair brush attachment:</b> All vacuum cleaners have attachable accessories, such as brushes and extension wands, for vacuuming drapery, upholstery and tight spaces. Upright vacuums for pet hair also have an extension wand, a brush or two and sometimes an upholstery tool, which resembles a lint roller brush.</p>
<p>Two of the upright canister vacuums we tested — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70355B/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</a> — had a special pet hair brush attachment. It’s about one-third the size of the regular beater brush, so you simply attach it to the extension wand and use it to get in between couch pillows or under your bed. Dirt Devil’s attachment has a rubberized claw, which is excellent for raking up hair from pile carpet.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Test conditions</h3>
<p>Our tester lives in a two-bedroom 1200 square-foot condominium that has approximately 90-percent low-pile carpeted floor. Every two weeks for a six-week period, he tested the vacuum cleaners by allowing hair from his mixed-breed terrier to accumulate.</p>
<p>Each vacuum was tested in a specified area of the condo, each area having both carpeted and marble-tile floors and several pieces of upholstered furniture, where his dog was allowed to sit and nap. If the vacuum was portable, our tester also vacuumed sections of the condo’s fifteen carpeted stairs. All of the handheld pet hair vacuums were tested on the stairs.</p>
<p>Our tester owns a Miele bagged canister vacuum and vacuumed an area as a comparison with the three upright bagless canister vacuums we decided to test. He changed the Miele bag at the beginning of the testing period so its suction power would not be diminished.</p>
<p>For the three handheld pet hair vacuums, he also allowed dog hair to accumulate on his car’s upholstered driver and passenger seats, carpeted floor and rear hatchback area.</p>
<h3>Vacuuming</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/vacuuming1.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Our tester vacuumed each designated area three times with each vacuum over the six-week period. After each vacuuming of the carpets and floors, he checked the beater brush to see whether any hair had been trapped in its bristles. If the vacuum had a special attachment for pet hair, he then vacuumed the upholstered furniture. Finally, using the same attachment, he vacuumed a section of the carpeted staircase.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>During the testing our tester noted the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Maneuverability:</b> Two of the uprights we tested &#8212; the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70355B/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</a> &#8212; had swiveled steering, which allowed easy access in corners and beneath the furniture and bed.</li>
<li><b>Weight: </b>Upright canister vacuums are designed to be lightweight. We tested how much effort it took to push the vacuum and also carry up the stairs.</li>
<li><b>Motorized attachment: </b>Several vacuums have a motorized brush attachment and we determined whether motorizing the separate beater brush was actually more efficient in picking up pet hair.</li>
<li><b>Length of power cord:</b> A longer power cord allows convenient access to multiple rooms from one electrical outlet.</li>
</ul>

<p>After each vacuuming, our tester documented the amount of hair, dust and debris trapped inside the canister and how easy or difficult it was to remove. Unlike a bagged canister vacuum, which does not need its bag changed after each vacuum, a bagless canister vacuum should have its canister emptied and washed every time.</p>
<p>Theoretically the vacuum’s filters should be changed once a year, but presumably that is advisable only if you wash the filters on a regular basis. Our tester noted how much dust each filter collected and washed it to determine its efficacy the next time he vacuumed.</p>
<p>The handheld vacuums were not as easy to clean. It was a challenge removing everything from the compact canister, and the filters were a dusty mess after each use. The Bissell &#8211; 33A1C’s ridged filter was especially troublesome to clean, since pet hair got trapped between the ridges and needed to be extracted by hand.</p>
<h2 id="upright">Best upright for pet hair</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shark-nv350.jpg" alt="Shark NV350" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The most critical thing we can say about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> is that its power cord could be longer. Besides that, this powerful, quiet and nearly perfect upright canister vacuum will make short work not only of pet hair, but also dirt, dust, debris and and anything else you may vacuum.</p>
<p>(The Shark &#8211; NV350 comes in a number of colors, each of which has a different serial number. We tested the lavender Shark &#8211; NV352.)</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; NV350 is marketed as “liftaway,” which means that the canister can be detached from the main chassis to transform into a portable vacuum. This feature allows you to vacuum anywhere within the power cord’s 25-foot reach and get into tight areas and up and down stairs.</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; NV350’s cyclone separation technology and completely sealed HEPA filtration system suck up every last bit of hair and dust. The HEPA filter also freshens the exhaust air from the side vents.</p>
<p>The canister is removed by unlatching top and bottom latches, which completely prevent any debris from flying up and out when you empty it into the trash. Before the testing period, our tester vacuumed frequently with a Miele bagged canister vacuum, so he was shocked when he saw how much more embedded hair and dust the Shark &#8211; NV350 vacuumed up.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shark-detaching.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>If that wasn’t eye-opening enough, our tester vacuumed over the same areas where he tested the Eureka &#8211; NEU180B and the Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B, and the Shark sucked up a half-full canister of more hair and dust.</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; NV350 is lightweight — less than 13 pounds — and has superb maneuverability thanks to its swivel steering and motorized power brush. The power brush can be turned on for carpets and off for bare floors. It took slightly more effort to push the Shark on bare floors, but on carpet, it practically whizzed around the room on its own volition.</p>
<p>The Shark has the usual attachments — crevice tools, a couple of brushes — and also includes a pet upholstery tool, which resembles a lint brush. It’s pretty good at picking up pet hair on furniture, but you need to brush in a downward direction.</p>

<p>Depending on where you purchase the Shark &#8211; NV350, a mini power brush is included (note: the mini power brush is not included with the Shark that is sold by Amazon). It works the same as the large motorized power brush, but it’s about one-third the size, which makes it perfect for stairs and reaching under the bed.</p>
<p>Clean-up is a cinch. The aforementioned liftaway canister makes it easy to empty the vacuumed-up debris into the trash, and it washes clean in seconds. Both foam filters are cleaned by simply rinsing them through with water and squeezing them dry.</p>
<p>Shark offers a five-year limited warranty and a lifetime guarantee for the foam filters and motor belt. The Shark &#8211; NV350 is the most expensive of the three upright canister vacuums we tested, but at $145, it’s still moderately priced for such a high-quality product that outperformed the other vacuums we tested.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight but extremely powerful, the Shark &#8211; NV350 can suction up every last bit of pet hair, dust and debris from both carpeted and non-carpeted floors.</li>
<li>It has excellent maneuverability thanks to its swivel steering and motorized beater brush.</li>
<li>The Shark &#8211; NV350 is one of the few vacuums marketed specifically for cleaning up pet hair that has a sealed filtration system with a HEPA filter.</li>
<li>Its “liftaway” canister turns the vacuum into a portable vacuum for getting into corners, up and down stairs and under furniture.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="handheld">Best handheld for pet hair</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-vac.jpg" alt="Black+Decker - HHVJ325BMP07" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>All three of the handheld vacuums we tested had elements designed specifically for picking up pet hair. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07</a> did the better job of vacuuming dust and dirt as well, thanks to its Smartech auto-sense feature that automatically changes speed and power levels by sensing whether you’re vacuuming carpet, bare floors or upholstery. The auto-sense’s LED indicator also shows battery life and whether it’s time to change the filter.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker is a cordless handheld and is charged by a lithium ion battery for a minimum of six hours. For all of our tests, the charge lasted approximately 18 minutes, which was nearly double the time that the Shark &#8211; SV780 (the other cordless handheld we tested) lasted.</p>
<p>During the period of its charge, the auto-sense did indeed switch speeds when we moved back and forth from carpeting (higher speed), furniture (middle speed) and floor (lowest speed). The charge did dip a bit to about 15 minutes when we kept the vacuum running at its highest speed.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker has very strong suction that lasted during most of its charge, and even when it began to diminish, it was still able to remove stubborn pet hair that clung to car carpeting.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Crevices and Corners: Black+Decker - HHVJ325BMP07</h3><p>The Black+Decker Pet Dustbuster has a long-lasting battery charge and powerful suction. Its unique sensor automatically shifts power levels from carpets to hardwood floors to upholstery.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The vacuum itself resembles a Dustbuster with an elongated nozzle that can be used for vacuuming tight corners and under cabinets. One of the Black+Decker’s excellent features is its beater-brush attachment that slips on to the nozzle. The brush’s alternating rows of rubber bristles and soft rubber tabs prevent long pet hair from getting wrapped and trapped when you’re vacuuming carpeted areas and upholstery.</p>
<p>We were also impressed by how well the Black+Decker sucked up dust from between couch cushions and pillows, which was revealed when we opened up its canister and examined its dual-filter system.</p>
<p>Everything is sucked into the canister where large debris, such as dog hair or cat litter, is separated. Dirt and dust are forced through the filter cup and trapped in the fabric filter bag that’s locked inside the cup. Once vacuuming is done, the filter cup can be removed and the pet hair in the main container emptied without dust flying everywhere.</p>
<p>Two fabric filters are included with the Black+Decker, one of which is scented and perfumes the exhaust air as you vacuum. The “fresh linen” scent is a bit overpowering, but the second filter bag is unscented. As with all handheld vacuums, they should be cleaned after every use. Cleaning is a simple task since the canister and filters can be quickly rinsed and dried.The Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07 is the most expensive of the three handheld vacuums for pet hair that we tested, but thanks to its brush attachment, we found that it was the only one that “powers through pet hair” as advertised. This is a fantastic all-around handheld vacuum you can use for any small area and upholstery.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07 has unique sensing capability that automatically switches power levels from carpet to bare floors to upholstery.</li>
<li>Its lithium-ion battery charges the Black+Decker for a solid 18 minutes, giving you plenty of time to vacuum a number of small areas.</li>
<li>Its power brush is made of alternating rows of rubber teeth and flaps, which prevent long hair from getting wrapped and trapped.</li>
<li>The Black+Decker’s dual filter system effectively sucks up and traps dust and dirt for easy and quick clean-up.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other products we tested</h2>
<h3>Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dirt-devil-pet-vac.jpg" alt="Dirt Devil - UD70355B" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70355B/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</a>, also known as the Razor Pet, is another cyclonic upright canister vacuum and appears to be one of the better made vacuums by this company. Dirt Devil markets the Razor Pet for pet owners by stamping a paw print icon on the box and canister, but it’s otherwise similar to the regular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70350B/dp/B06XDK8Q3B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil Razor</a>.</p>
<p>The only addition to the Razor Pet is its “turboclaw” attachment. It’s a mini beater brush with nine rubber teeth that presumably are designed to rake up hair from a carpet. However, to work properly, the claw must be held at a 45-degree angle so the beater brush can actually reach the carpet. The vacuum has strong suction, so pet hair is lifted up without the assistance of the useless — but cute — turboclaw.</p>
<p>The Razor Pet did an excellent job of consistently sucking up pet hair into neat whirling balls inside the canister. It has swivel steering like the Shark &#8211; NV350, and you can lower the vacuum head so it’s nearly flat (which lets you get under furniture) but we found the steering to be stiff and not very easy to maneuver. In fact, even though the Razor Pet is lightweight, we needed quite a bit of elbow grease to push the vacuum around.</p>
<p>The cyclonic separation works differently in the Razor Pet than it does in the Shark &#8211; NV350. The vortex keeps the vacuumed hair separated and elevated and dust and dirt is forced upwards through a conical foam-covered filter. A latch on the bottom of the canister releases the hair, but the filter must be removed from the top of the canister by unlatching a needlessly difficult lock.</p>
<p>Once removed, the foam is slipped off the ridged fabric filter, which traps hair between the ridges and must be pulled out by hand. A good amount of dust is trapped in the filter, but since it’s not sealed, like with the Shark &#8211; NV350, the Razor Pet cannot capture pet dander. It’s a good all-around vacuum, but it really isn’t a vacuum for handling the challenges of pet hair.</p>
<h3>Eureka &#8211; NEU180B</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/eureka-neu180b.jpg" alt="Eureka - NEU180B" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-NEU180B-Lightweight-Powerful-Graphite/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEU180B</a> is an upright canister vacuum that’s marketed specifically as a pet hair vacuum, but again, in reality, it’s just a vacuum with a lint brush tool. It’s very lightweight, because it seems to be made almost entirely of plastic. One Amazon reviewer wrote that it looks like a kid’s toy, and we have to agree. Even though it weighs only ten pounds, we found it difficult to push around carpeted floors, and it has no steering capability at all.</p>
<p>It has an extra large canister, but it’s not a cyclonic vacuum, so everything blows up into and swirls around the lower third of the canister. Other than a thin piece of foam in the canister, the Eureka doesn’t have an air filter system, so clearly it’s not been designed for pet dander and dust — plus, the exhaust air does not smell clean.</p>
<p>The beater brush can purportedly be adjusted to five levels with a lever, two of which are mysteriously not labeled, but we turned the lever to each level, and nothing moved. Since the beater brush should not be used on a hardwood floor, this is a major design flaw.</p>
<p>For such a noisy vacuum, it doesn’t seem to have much suction power. The ultimate test result was that we vacuumed the same area with the other two upright vacuums, which picked up double the amount that the Eureka did.</p>
<h3>Shark &#8211; SV780</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shark-sv780.jpg" alt="Shark - SV780" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>This cordless handheld vacuum has cyclonic technology, like its upright vacuum, with a built-in beater brush. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pet-Perfect-Cordless-Technology-Rechargeable-SV780/dp/B0037HHFMO/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; SV780</a> is powered by a rechargeable 18-volt nickel metal hydride battery, which lasts longer than alkaline batteries in high-drain electronics. Be that as it may, each time we charged the Shark &#8211; SV780, full power lasted slightly less than eight-and-a-half minutes.</p>
<p>For the brief time that the Shark &#8211; SV780 is at full power, it’s got powerful suction and grabbed up everything in its path, including pet hair deeply embedded in car carpeting. Its side vents are positioned beneath the rubberized grip handle, so the exhaust blows backwards and doesn’t scatter the debris you’re vacuuming.</p>
<p>It has a sturdy bag filter that captures dust and dander, and it’s very easy to clean. It’s a terrific handheld vacuum that does indeed seem like it was designed for pet hair. However, because of its short charge, it just doesn’t give you enough time to clean up anything other than quick little messes.</p>
<h3>Bissell &#8211; 33A1C</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bissell-33A1C.jpg" alt="Bissell - 33A1C" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bissell-Eraser-Handheld-Vacuum-Corded/dp/B001EYFQ28/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; 33A1C</a> is one of the most highly rated handheld vacuums on Amazon. The majority of reviewers cite the low price, and at $30, it’s absolutely the least expensive of handheld vacuums for pet hair. We found it to be very effective on our dog’s bed; it grabbed up every last hair. However, its rubber-teethed mouth doesn’t really rake up the hair, and we had to go over the bed several times before all the hair was picked up.</p>
<p>It’s corded, so it has limitations as to where you can vacuum. We found the vacuum especially challenging when trying to clean the car, since you need an outlet nearby that can accommodate its cord.</p>
<p>The vent exhaust is close to the head, so for anything other than hair, the exhaust air blows it around. The Bissell’s tapered mouth allows you to vacuum in tight spaces, but the spaces in the rubbered mouth are so small that it really can’t pick up much besides pet hair.</p>
<p>Finally, cleaning the filter is a pain, especially if you have a pet with long hair. The Pet Hair Eraser has a ridged fabric filter, which traps long pet hair and can only be removed by picking it out with your fingers.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There’s clearly a lot of competition in marketing a vacuum to pet owners, and at first, it can be daunting to decide which type of vacuum you need and then whether it really can do as advertised. You could certainly spend a month’s rent on a very high-end vacuum, but we focused our research and subsequent testing on reasonably priced upright and handheld vacuums that were designed specifically for vacuuming pet hair.</p>
<p>The best upright bagless canister vacuum for pet hair was unquestionably the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a>. Its swivel steering and motorized beater brush give this lightweight vacuum excellent maneuverability, so you can get under furniture and into tight corners. The Shark &#8211; NV350 has a dual air filtration system with a HEPA filter, which eliminates virtually every speck of dust and dander on your carpets and floors. It also has a canister that can be removed to transform it into a portable vacuum that’s perfect for going up and down stairs.</p>
<p>Our pick for the best handheld vacuum for pet hair is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07</a>. It’s a cordless handheld and its charge lasts 18 minutes, giving you plenty of time for rapid clean up of small areas. The Black+Decker’s automatic sensor shifts power levels automatically when you move from carpets to bare floors to upholstery. It’s more expensive than other handheld vacuums, but it really does the job that others didn’t in our tests.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After using five of the best stand mixers on the market to make pizza crust, cookie dough and cakes, we've found that the KitchenAid - KSM150PSWH is the clear winner. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e subjected five highly rated stand mixers to rigorous testing — from making light-as-air sponge cake batter to perfectly kneaded pizza dough — and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150P</a> performed the best.

<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>If you Google “stand mixer,” you’ll find many websites and videos promoting the best one you should buy. However, when you take a closer look, you’ll see that an overwhelming majority don’t actually take the time to test the product, or if they do, test methods are vague.</p>
<p>We found two exceptions in our initial phase of research: The Wirecutter and America’s Test Kitchen’s video review. America’s Test Kitchen’s test methods are solid, but the review is five years old so the recommendations may no longer be valid. We then turned to Amazon, where KitchenAid stand mixers reign supreme, and read through many of the thousands of reviews (KitchenAid alone has over 9,000).</p>
<p>KitchenAid has many versions of stand mixers that are rated extremely high overall by consumers. Depending on the model (and color), they range between $200–$500. But who are KitchenAid’s competitors? There aren’t many.</p>
<p>We chose to focus on finding stand mixers with an affordable price, the convenient tilt-head design, a mixing bowl with a substantial 4.5 to 5-quart capacity and high customer esteem.  Once we had our list, we cross-referenced the stand mixers with the manufacturers’ websites to ensure we tested the most recent model.</p>

<h2 id="who">Who needs a stand mixer?</h2>
<p>If cupcakes, sugar cookies and cake mixes are the extent of your baking repertoire, then you probably just need a hand mixer and a sturdy mixing bowl. But if you’re a more frequent baker of yeast breads, sponge cakes, chunky cookies, fluffy meringues and pizzas, then a heavy-duty stand mixer has the power and size to substantially decrease your time and effort.</p>
<p>While a hand mixer is a light and portable appliance, most stand mixers require kitchen counter space. Some have evolved to become slightly more compact, but they’re still pretty tall (12 to 14 inches) and hefty (up to 26 pounds), which makes storing them in a kitchen cabinet difficult if not impossible.</p>
<p>Another consideration is price. You can buy a very good hand mixer for about $30, but a well-built stand mixer is much more expensive. There are certainly cheaper models to choose from (and we tested one — the Cheftronic &#8211; SM986), but many Amazon reviewers claim that the motors and attachments of the cheaper mixers don’t hold up. If you can afford $300 and are committed to baking on a frequent basis, then a quality stand mixer is well worth it.</p>
<h2 id="important">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Professional vs. commercial: </b>Almost all stand mixers intended for home kitchens are marketed as &#8220;professional&#8221; grade. A commercial stand mixer is too large for a home kitchen and is used exclusively in restaurants and bakeries. It can also cost three or four times more than a professional mixer.</p>
<p><b>Planetary motion: </b>There are two types of stand mixers: planetary motion and spiral. Planetary motion refers to how the mixer’s attachment revolves — like a planet’s orbit — inside the fixed mixing bowl. Planetary motion mixers are designed for both home and commercial use. A spiral mixer, used exclusively in commercial kitchens for preparing large batches of dough, revolves the mixing bowl and hook attachment together.</p>
<p><b>Tilt-head vs. bowl-lift:</b> Many newer models of stand mixers have a tilt head — a button or lever loosens the mixer’s head so it can be lifted backward to accommodate easy removal of attachments and the mixing bowl. Older models have a “bowl lift” head in which a lever raises and lowers the mixing bowl. While bowl-lift stand mixers are heavier and sturdier, tilt-head mixers are lighter and more compact. It’s easier to add ingredients into a bowl-lift mixer, but it’s easier to clean and store a tilt-head mixer.</p>
<p><b>Mixing bowl shape and depth:</b> During our testing, we found the shape and depth of the mixing bowl to be crucial to the mixer’s efficacy. All of the mixing bowls we tested had a 4.5- to 5-quart capacity. Half of them had rounded bottoms, and with these, the mixer struggled to reach ingredients (such as egg whites and whipping cream). The better mixing bowls had a slight taper, which kept the wet ingredients contained in a compact pool that the attachments could reach and lift up.</p>
<p><b>Attachment length: </b>All stand mixers come with three attachments: a wire whisk, a mixing paddle and a dough hook. The length of attachments is of primary importance, since they need to reach the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl. Half the mixers — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BEM800XL-Scraper-5-Quart-Die-Cast/dp/B003QI9HPW/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a> — had attachments that easily incorporated ingredients with minimal or no scraping needed. The other mixers had attachments that were too short and not broad enough to incorporate ingredients without our stopping, scraping and re-starting.</p>
<p><b>Splatter shield: </b>We prefer a c-shaped splatter shield over an enclosed-ring splatter shield. A c-shape splatter shield, which slides into place on top of the mixing bowl, can be easily attached and removed without lifting the tilt head. An enclosed-ring splatter shield, however, must be attached to the mixer head before affixing or releasing the attachment and then lowered together onto the bowl.</p>
<p><b>Power: </b>A stand mixer should have at least 325 watts of power. However, a mixer with more wattage does not necessarily mean that it’s more efficient. The mixer’s motor must be precisely engineered to harness wattage to create adequate torque (the force needed to rotate an object), which is essential for kneading dough.</p>
<p>For example, the KitchenAid mixer has only 325 watts, but its excellent torque can knead pizza dough into a compact ball. The Cheftronic mixer has double the wattage, but it shook violently and struggled to incorporate the ingredients and knead the dough during our testing.</p>
<p><b>Speed levels: </b>The mixers we tested had six to twelve speed levels. There was minute differentiation between the mixers that had 12 speeds. In actuality, you probably just need five speed levels: a true low for incorporating flour or wet ingredients without splatter; a medium-low, medium and medium-high for combining ingredients; and a true high for aerating egg whites and whipping cream.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>

<p>We devised tests that worked the most commonly used functions of a stand mixer: creaming butter and sugar, blending cake batter, whipping egg whites and cream, blending cookie dough with mix-ins and mixing pizza dough.<br />
[table id=212 /]
<h3>Small-batch whipping</h3>
<p><b>Egg whites: </b>We began with small-batch whipping to test whether the mixer’s attachments could reach the bottom of the mixing bowl. For each mixer, we put two room-temperature egg whites into the bowl and started the mixer at its slowest speed. Once the egg whites began to foam, we gradually increased the speed to the highest setting and timed how long it took for the whites to stiffen to a meringue consistency — in other words, a consistency that would not plop out when we held the mixing bowl upside down.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid, Breville and Hamilton Beach whipped the egg whites to a meringue consistency in one minute.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart and Cheftronic just foamed the two egg whites because their whisks could not reach the bottom of the mixing bowls. However, once a third egg white was added, the whisks could at least reach enough of the egg white to pull it upwards and whisk it to froth.</p>
<p><b>Cream: </b>We poured one cup of chilled heavy cream into the bowl and began at the slowest speed, waiting until the cream frothed and then gradually increased to the highest speed. Results were similar to those of the egg white test. The KitchenAid, Breville and Hamilton Beach whipped thick whipped cream in one minute.</p>
<p>Because of their short whisks, Cuisinart and Cheftronic failed to whip one cup of cream. We added a second cup and both achieved fully whipped cream in about two minutes.</p>
<h3>Cake batter</h3>
<p>We used “The Great British Baking Show” judge <a href="https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/mary_berrys_perfect_34317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Berry’s recipe for genoise</a>, or sponge cake, which serves as the base for many types of iced cakes.</p>
<p>The recipe differs from other sponge cakes in that the eggs are not cooked over a double-boiler before adding them to the other ingredients. Instead, everything is blended together all at once, and to achieve a light and airy cake, the stand mixer must be able to evenly mix the ingredients while also whipping the eggs and creaming the butter into a smooth batter. If the mixer fails to do so, or if excess scraping of the bowl is required, then the cake won’t rise when baked.</p>
<p>The Breville and the Cheftronic have a silicon scraper on their paddle attachments. This nice addition worked well in scraping the sides of the bowl during blending so we didn’t need to stop, scrape and restart.</p>
<h3>Cookie dough</h3>
<p>We wanted a thick cookie dough with lots of mix-ins to test each mixer’s power and torque. <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/super-chunky-cookies-3362198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This delicious recipe for super chunky cookies</a> allows you to add whatever you like to the dough. Our mix-ins included peanuts, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, raisins and M&amp;Ms, which proved to be a challenge for the Cuisinart and Cheftronic. Their squat paddles simply couldn’t reach down to the bottom of their too-deep mixing bowls, so the ingredients had to be mixed by hand.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we also had a bit of trouble with the KitchenAid and Breville. Although their motors breezed easily through the thick dough — even at the highest speed — there were small amounts of mix-ins left untouched at the bottom of the bowl. Only the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach</a> was able to thoroughly blend the cookie dough and mix-ins together.</p>
<h3>Pizza dough</h3>
<p>The most challenging test for the stand mixers was the pizza dough. The mixer’s hook attachment must first blend the ingredients together and then knead them into a compact yet elastic ball. We used <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/pizza-dough-recipe-1914764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a standard recipe for the pizza dough</a>, but we cut the proportions in half, which better suited the 4.5- to 5-quart capacity bowls. Even with the half batch, the usual culprits — Cuisinart and Cheftronic — failed to combine the ingredients and shook violently when the mixer kneaded the dough.</p>
<p>As an additional test — and something you really shouldn’t do at home — we increased the speed to the highest level during the kneading to see whether the motor gave out. The KitchenAid and Breville vibrated slightly, but they clearly were able to handle the dough at high speed. The Hamilton Beach shook rather ominously, but it kept right on kneading and seemed to hold out.</p>

<p>KitchenAid has been the leader in stand mixers for years. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PSWH</a> is one of the popular Artisan Series tilt-head mixers and comes in a variety of sizes, styles and colors.</p>
<p>It’s slightly smaller and a bit more compact than KitchenAid’s other stand mixers, but it still isn’t ideal for storing in a cabinet because it weighs in at 25 pounds. That heft, however, keeps the all-metal mixer secure on the countertop even at the highest speed. Its 325-watt motor has enough power to plow through cookie and pizza dough without showing signs of strain, and it performs every task in minutes. As stand mixers go, it’s also quiet.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid is very easy to use. Its tilt head is locked and released with a lever on one side, and it tilts far back enough for easy insertion of attachments. The five-quart stainless steel mixing bowl locks firmly into place by turning it slightly clockwise. Lower the tilt head and you’re ready to go.</p>

It’s less expensive than previous KitchenAid models, and with the separately bought attachments, it can also roll out pasta, grind meat and spiralize vegetables.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The KitchenAid has 10 speed levels, marked as Stir, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. They’re controlled with a side lever that clicks into place. For the odd-numbered speeds, you need to hold the control lever and gently guide it to the speed you want. There isn’t much differentiation between the odd- and even-numbered speeds. The even-numbered speeds are so well differentiated, however, you don’t really need the other five.</p>
<p>The mixing bowl is slightly tapered, so when you lower the attachments (nylon-coated paddle and dough hook, stainless steel wire whisk) you’ll notice immediately that each touches the bottom and sides of the bowl. For each of our recipes, we needed to do very little — and sometimes no — scraping to incorporate the ingredients.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid was the top performer in all of our tests. It smoothly creamed the butter and aerated the eggs to create an evenly blended cake batter, which baked light and airy. It had no problems blending the large amount of mix-ins into the thick cookie dough and it kneaded a perfect ball of pizza dough in five minutes. Since the mixer’s attachments touch the bottom of the mixing bowl, the wire whisk whipped the egg whites and cream to fluffy heights in one minute.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid stand mixer can really do anything, except perhaps wash your clothes. Its extraordinary design includes a hub on the mixer head into which a variety of (separately purchased) attachments can be plugged, such as a pasta maker, meat grinder, cheese shredder and even a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-spiralizer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spiralizer</span></a>.</p>
<p>So although all KitchenAid stand mixers are on the pricey side, you’re getting much more for your money, since your mixer can be swiftly transformed into another kitchen appliance. (For the record, we’ve tested the pasta maker and the meat grinder, and they are excellent.)</p>
<p>Although KitchenAid’s warranty is only for one year, the Artisan stand mixer is so well-constructed that, if properly cared for, it will last for many years. We believe there isn’t a stand mixer on the market that can beat the KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan Series in quality or performance.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PSWH is sturdily constructed and has plenty of power to plow through thick cookie dough and pizza dough in minutes.</li>
<li>Its mixing bowl and attachments have been designed to work together for optimal mixing and blending with minimal scraping.</li>
<li>The KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan Series is very user-friendly, and it will have you baking like a pro straight out of the box.</li>

<h2 id="budget">Budget pick: Hamilton Beach &#8211; 63232</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >

<p>Hamilton Beach really scores with this beautifully made stand mixer from its line of Eclectrics kitchen appliances. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 63232</a> has many similar features that our top pick has, including its all-metal construction and (at this writing) it’s $120 cheaper. We’ve reviewed many Hamilton Beach products, and most have, sadly, been disappointing. However, their Eclectrics series stand mixer is top notch and nearly equally as good as the KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan.</p>
<p>Like the Artisan, the Hamilton Beach has the tapered mixing bowl that we find is most effective for blending small-batch ingredients. Indeed, it whipped two egg whites in a minute and a half to meringue consistency and one cup of cream into fluffy perfection in one minute.</p>
<p>Again, the Hamilton Beach’s efficacy is due to the length and width of the attachments (nylon-coated paddle and dough hook and stainless wire whisk), which reach the bottom and sides of the mixing bowl.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has 400 watts, slightly more than the KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan, and its torque is just as good. It incorporated all the ingredients for the cookie dough and pizza dough well enough, but not without some vibration, especially at higher speeds.</p>

It has a couple of design quirks, like an inconvenient tilt-head release, but overall it’s well-made and durable and will last for years with frequent use.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Hamilton Beach blended the cake batter in two minutes, and when baked, it was moist and firm with a good crumb. It was absolutely the best of all the cakes we made with the mixers. Despite the vibration at the middle speed, the mix-ins were fully incorporated into the cookie dough, and when baked, the cookies came out of the oven exactly the same as those we made with the KitchenAid.</p>
<p>The Eclectrics had a bit of trouble with the pizza dough. The machine shook when it was kneading and the dough took various forms during the kneading process, running up and down the hook as a cylinder, then an oval before forming a compact ball. However, when the kneading was completed, the dough was beautifully shiny, smooth and elastic; again, the best of the pizza doughs we made.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach has a few negatives that are not deal-breakers. First, the button for releasing the tilt head is located inconveniently beneath the base of the head and we had trouble finding it when the head was tilted back. Second, like the KitchenAid, speed levels are even-numbered — 2 through 12 — and there is almost no differentiation between them and the odd-numbered levels (not marked on the blender). Finally, its splatter guard is an enclosed-ring type that we find inconvenient to attach and remove.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach has really stepped up to the plate to compete with KitchenAid. At $120 less, the Eclectrics stand mixer is an impressive and, we believe, long-lasting alternative for budget-conscious consumers.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 63232 stand mixer has a similar mixing bowl and attachments to the KitchenAid &#8211; Artisan, but it’s $120 less expensive and an excellent alternative.</li>
<li>It performed just as well as our top pick and even bested the KitchenAid in our cake and pizza dough tests.</li>
<li>Despite a few minor flaws, the Hamilton Beach stand mixer is solidly constructed, well-designed and will last for years with frequent use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like most Breville products, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BEM800XL-Scraper-5-Quart-Die-Cast/dp/B003QI9HPW/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BEM800XL</a> stand mixer is beautifully designed. It’s a sleek machine with curved lines and a futuristic speed-control LED panel that lights up as levels are increased.</p>
<p>The Breville has lift-assist handles to raise and lower the tilt head, and its slightly tapered bowl easily locks into place. It has twelve speeds, labeled with a particular baking task, like fold/knead, light mix and aerate/whip. We tested all speeds, and it was one of the few mixers we tested that had a gradual increase between each speed level.</p>
<p>For such an attractive machine, we were surprised that it didn’t perform better. We found its pour shield most vexing. It’s c-shaped, but quite narrow and tricky to balance on top of the bowl. The pour spout clicks into the shield, which can only be done when the tilt head is lowered. Each time we tried to scrape the bowl and lifted the tilt head back, the shield popped off and the pour spout plopped into the batter or dough.</p>
<p>The Breville’s silicon-edged scraper paddle manages to scrape the sides of the bowl, but it’s too short and can’t reach the bottom of the bowl. The same flaw afflicts the wire whisk, which left a small pool of cream not whipped. The Breville failed the two-egg test — it just foamed the whites — but when we added a third egg white, it aerated them to a sturdy meringue texture in one minute.</p>
<p>The lower speeds don’t seem to be as effective as the higher speeds. The Breville struggled to incorporate the mix-ins into the cookie dough. Although it blended the pizza dough well enough, it couldn’t quite knead it until we increased the speed to medium-high. In fact, even at the highest speed, the Breville only slightly vibrated and gave no indication that the motor would fail.</p>
<p>It’s a very good stand mixer, but it’s slightly more expensive than the KitchenAid, which we believe to be superior to the Breville.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8EJ81Q/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cheftronic &#8211; SM986</a> is one of several relatively inexpensive stand mixers, ranging in price from $90 to $150. While it may seem like a bargain compared to the KitchenAid, you definitely get what you pay for in this case. It’s cheaply constructed; its entire casing is plastic. The attachments are short and stout and can’t reach the sides or bottom of the rounded stainless steel mixing bowl.</p>
<p>The tilt head is released by pushing down a lever, which could use a shot of WD40 in our opinion: it was so creaky, and if you don’t keep your hand on top of the head, it snaps back. Its annoying enclosed-ring splatter shield can only be removed by taking off the attachment first. Since we had to frequently scrape the mixing bowl, we needed to do this several times.</p>
<p>At 650 watts, the Cheftronic has double the wattage of the Cuisinart, but it’s a perfect example of a poorly made and exceedingly noisy motor that can’t efficiently harness the high wattage. There is almost no differentiation between its first three lower speeds, then it suddenly zooms into high speed at levels four through six.</p>
<p>The Cheftronic struggled mightily to combine the pizza ingredients, and during kneading, the entire mixer rocked back and forth rhythmically as the dough ball formed. It couldn’t handle the small-batch tests, and after we increased the egg whites and cream, it whipped both in four minutes and two minutes, respectively — much longer than the other stand mixers we tested.</p>
<p>The Cheftronic’s silver plastic model is priced at $150, but for $30 more, you could buy the far better Hamilton Beach &#8211; Eclectrics stand mixer instead.</p>

<p>We’re usually impressed with Cuisinart’s product line, but we weren’t with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-SM-50BC-Stand-Brushed-Chrome/dp/B01K2FQ4DE/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; SM50BC</a> stand mixer. It copies a few of the KitchenAid’s features, like a durable metal casing, easy-release tilt head, secure locking bowl and c-shaped splatter guard with generous pour spout.</p>
<p>But that’s where the similarities end. The Cuisinart has twelve speeds, controlled by a flimsy plastic dial, the first six of which have almost no differentiation. The medium and higher speeds are better defined. We had almost the exact same issues with the Cuisinart as we had with Cheftronic because of poor design: a rounded mixing bowl that’s much too deep and stubby, narrow attachments.</p>
<p>The mixing paddle failed to blend the butter into the cake batter, leaving stray bits behind. Plus, it couldn’t reach the mix-ins for the cookie dough, which remained untouched in the bottom of the bowl. The dough hook simply swirled the dough ingredients and the whisk just foamed and splattered the egg whites and cream — until we increased the amount of each.</p>
<p>This stand mixer simply doesn’t live up to Cuisinart’s reputation. The motor is powerful enough, but it can’t compensate for the mixing bowl and attachments that are virtually useless.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you love to bake or bake large amounts on a frequent basis, then there’s no better kitchen appliance than a stand mixer. A great stand mixer needs to be multi-functional and have a durable, well-designed motor with sufficient power to last many years.</p>
<p>KitchenAid has long been a leader in manufacturing outstanding stand mixers, and its  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005UP2K/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PSWH</a> — one of the Artisan Series stand mixers — is no exception. It handily out-performed all of the stand mixers we tested. The KitchenAid plowed through thick cookie dough and kneaded sticky pizza dough with ease; smoothly mixed the batter for an airy sponge cake; and whipped egg whites and cream to frothy peaks in a minute.</p>
<p>This KitchenAid stand mixer is so easy to use and with all the amazing attachments you can purchase, it’s like having a Transformer in your kitchen.</p>
<p>A less expensive option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; Eclectrics</a> stand mixer. It’s also well-made, and though it takes slightly longer to perform the same tasks as the KitchenAid Artisan, the Hamilton Beach stood up to our tests and even bested the Artisan in a couple of them. At $120 less than the KitchenAid, the Hamilton Beach &#8211; Eclectrics is a very good and affordable alternative.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter 40 hours of baking cakes, kneading bread and mashing 20 pounds of potatoes, we determined that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BHM800SIL-Handy-Scraper-Silver/dp/B00XBOXUWC/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BHM800SIL</a> is the best hand mixer. Its smart ergonomic design and intuitive nine-speed controls surpassed the other six hand mixers we tested.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected hand mixers to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by reading hundreds of reviews of hand mixers posted on Amazon, focusing on those that had the highest ratings. From there we went to the manufacturers’ websites for the hand mixers we were interested in testing to compare features and accessories.</p>
<p>The majority of hand mixers run about $20 or less, and they’re very similar in appearance, wattage and accessories. But we also wanted to test higher-end models to determine if their additional features were worth the increased price.</p>
<p>Included in our research was reading reliable and authentic reviews of hand mixers posted by other review sites to learn what criteria each used to test and rate hand mixers.</p>
<p>We also read through several Reddit threads to learn how people use hand mixers and what’s important for them when they’re considering buying a new one. We compared user recommendations with those other online product reviews, then culled through the hand mixers that are the newest models, or currently available, to settle on the seven hand mixers we would test.</p>
<h2 id="the-seven-best">Compare the best hand mixers</h2>
[table id=167 /]
<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a hand mixer?</h2>
<p>A hand mixer is primarily used for small baking tasks, such as mixing cake batter, creaming butter and sugar or whipping egg whites and heavy cream. Many online comments cite the hand mixer as the perfect appliance for whipping mashed potatoes into an ultra-smooth and fluffy consistency.</p>
<p>Larger baking or cooking tasks are better accomplished with a stand mixer, which allows you to perform several functions completely hands-free. A stand mixer, however, is very heavy and difficult to store anywhere except a countertop, and it lacks portability. Conversely, a hand mixer offers flexibility and can be used in almost any size mixing bowl.</p>
<h3>Hand mixer versus immersion blender</h3>
<p>An <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-immersion-blender/" rel="noopener">immersion blender</a> or stick blender is ideal for pureeing hot or cold soups, fresh-fruit drinks or smoothies and mayonnaise or other sauces. High-end models, such as the Breville &#8211; BSB510XL Control Grip and the KitchenAid &#8211; KHB2351, include a whisk attachment. We tested their whisk attachments to determine whether an immersion blender could perform the same whipping tasks as a hand mixer.</p>
<p>In both cases, it took substantially longer to whip cream, since any speed higher than low splattered the cream everywhere. We had more success with egg whites, which didn’t splatter at high speed.</p>
<p>We had two problems with the mashed potatoes: first, it took quite a bit of effort to push down on the potatoes, and second, the immersion blender’s blade pureed the potatoes into a thick and gummy consistency. Good for vichyssoise, perhaps, but terrible for mashed potatoes.</p>
<p>Consequently, we decided that a hand mixer is really a better appliance for these tasks.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p><b>Beaters: </b>All hand mixers come with two beaters used for most baking tasks. The beaters for newer and up-scale models are thin wires, not dissimilar from a wire whisk, and range from five-to-six inches in length with a diameter of about two inches. Wire beaters are open, as opposed to the thick beaters, which have four metal tines attached to a center post. Wire beaters are much easier to clean, and by driving ingredients downward rather than outward, they also reduce splatter.</p>
<p><b>Whisk: </b>Almost all hand mixers include a single wire whisk (the Vremi did not), which is used only for whipping cream and egg whites. The wire whisk should have a diameter of at least three inches to efficiently aerate the ingredient you’re whipping. We found the majority of the whisk attachments to be flimsy and not wide enough to effectively aerate.</p>
<p><b>The only hand mixer we tested to include two wire whisks is the</b> <b>Breville &#8211; BHM800SIL</b><b>,</b> which easily outperformed all single-whisk hand mixers. The Breville’s attachments are made of stainless steel rather than chrome or chrome-plated like other mixers.</p>

<p><b>Dough hooks</b>: Elongated, curly-cue-shaped dough hooks are used exclusively for blending and kneading yeast-based doughs. During our testing, the dough hooks were able to blend ingredients, but we found it a real challenge to knead the dough, which kept twirling around one hook or riding up the side of the bowl. Overall, we decided dough hooks are pretty useless for kneading, and you get better results by kneading dough by hand.</p>
<h3>Power</h3>
<p>The hand mixers we tested ranged between 150 watts (Vremi) and 290 watts (KitchenAid). The Vremi stalled a bit with the bread dough, but it had enough power for other tests. The Breville and Oster are both 240 watts, which is sufficient for any baking task.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>We determined that speed levels were more important than the actual wattage, and more speed levels do not necessarily mean better mixing.</p>
<p>For example, the KitchenAid &#8211; KHM926WH has nine speeds, but there is little difference between each level, so it’s like having only three speeds, low, medium and high. Conversely, the Breville and the Cuisinart &#8211; HM-90S also have nine speeds, but there is a very clear differentiation between each one. Adding to this, the Breville suggests levels of speed for a particular task, such as creaming (4-6) and whipping (7-9), which we found helpful in our trial test runs.</p>
<p>You also want a hand mixer with a “true” slow speed, especially for adding flour or sugar to a batter or mix. The less expensive hand mixers we tested did not have a sufficiently slow speed, which resulted in spray and splatter. The higher-end models — the Breville, Cuisinart and KitchenAid — had very slow lower-speed levels and were the best for incorporating dry ingredients.</p>

<p>Overall, we decided that a true low, medium-low, medium, medium-high and high are really the only speeds you need for a hand mixer.</p>
<h3>Ergonomics</h3>
<p>Most of the hand mixers we tested weighed about two pounds (the Vremi was the lightest at only one pound), so they’re designed to be easy to maneuver in a mixing bowl. The Vremi was the easiest to zoom around the bowl, whereas the Oster felt a bit bulky.</p>

<p>Naturally, it’s a personal choice how the mixer fits into your hand, but we discovered that the location of the power/pause and speed level switches are important. When you’re adding ingredients, you want to be able to change speeds or pause the mixer at intervals to ensure thorough mixing. So the switches should be within your thumb’s reach and easy to press.</p>

<p>Hands-down, the Breville is the easiest to control with its unique scroll wheel that allows you to change speeds with a flick of your thumb. The Cuisinart and KitchenAid also have easy-to-reach speed controls, but we found the location of their power buttons to be a bit awkward. The other models have levers for speed control, and these proved to be stiff and inexact.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our tests comprised the most common baking tasks for a hand blender:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whipping egg whites into a fluffy meringue.</li>
<li>Whipping heavy cream into stiff peaks.</li>
<li>Combining dry ingredients with wet ingredients without splatter.</li>
<li>Creaming butter and sugar evenly.</li>
<li>Blending cake batter to a smooth consistency.</li>
<li>Churning heavy doughs like cookie, bread or pizza.</li>
<li>Kneading bread or pizza dough.</li>
</ul>
<p>We chose <a href="http://www.kitchme.com/recipes/lemon-sponge-cake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this recipe for a sponge cake</a> for testing whipping, combining and blending and this <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/basic-homemade-bread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic recipe for bread</a> for churning and kneading. We performed separate tests for whipping cream and creaming butter with sugar.</p>
<p>Our tests for whipping egg whites and cream also included timing how long it took the hand mixer’s whisk attachment to whip them into stiff peaks.</p>
<h3>Features Comparison</h3>
[table id=168 /]
<p>Many people comment online that they use their hand mixer for whipping mashed potatoes. For each hand mixer we tested, we boiled two pounds of russet potatoes until tender, mashed them and added two tablespoons of butter and half a cup of warmed milk. Using the beater attachment we timed how long it took to blend the potatoes to a smooth and fluffy consistency.</p>
<p>An equally important element in testing the hand mixers was their ergonomic design. We wanted a hand mixer that fits easily and comfortably in the hand and was light enough to maneuver effortlessly in a mixing bowl.</p>
<p>We also tested how easily or difficult it was to change speeds, power on and off, pause and eject attachments with a flick of the thumb. Finally, we hand-washed the attachments to determine how easy they were to clean.</p>

<p>Thoughtful design and superb engineering handily elevated the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BHM800SIL-Handy-Scraper-Silver/dp/B00XBOXUWC/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BHM800SIL</a> nine-speed hand mixer to the top. The Breville is the most expensive of the hand mixers we tested, but if you’re serious about baking, the Breville is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p>The Breville has a number of unique features that set it apart. Physically it’s been designed to fit ergonomically in your hand. Its handle rests comfortably in your palm, and although it’s a bit heavier than other models, it glides around a mixing bowl almost by itself. You simply guide the mixer where you want it to go. An unusual feature is a trigger ring fitted for your forefinger. It’s actually the eject mechanism, but it also contributes to the mixer’s maneuverability in your hand.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the scroll wheel for adjusting speed levels is remarkably easy for increasing or decreasing speed. Above the wheel is an LED panel with a speed indicator and a timer that begins timing when the mixer is turned on and pauses timing whenever the pause button is pressed.</p>
<p>The Breville’s electrical cord has a plug with a finger-hole for rapid removal from a socket, and most impressively, the base of the cord in the mixer’s chassis swivels, so it can be used by both right- and left-handed people. As if these design elements weren’t enough, the Breville has a light located between the beaters that shines into your mixing bowl each time you power on.</p>

This mixer comes at a higher pricer point, but it delivers outstanding performance and ergonomics, including a swivel cord and trigger ring that improves your maneuverability in the bowl.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XBOXUWC/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Breville’s stainless-steel attachments include two silicone-coated beaters, which didn’t clatter against our mixing bowls and also virtually eliminated scraping down ingredients, two dough hooks and two wire whisks. No other hand mixer has two whisks, and the Breville’s easily doubled the volume of egg whites to fluffy heights in a minute.</p>
<p>An especially remarkable engineering feat is the mixer automatically adjusts the range of speed depending on which attachments you insert. For example, the dough hooks need less speed than the whisks or beaters. So when you insert the dough hooks, the mixer’s low speeds decrease so they’re low enough that flour doesn’t splatter when added.</p>
<p>The Breville’s performance matched its design in excellence. Our only complaint — and it’s the same for all of the blenders we tested — is the dough hooks do a good job of combining the ingredients into a blended dough, but kneading gave us trouble. Even at a low speed, we had to fight the dough from climbing up the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>The Breville’s hefty price tag might discourage casual bakers or cooks, but we do believe this is an exceptional hand mixer for someone who really enjoys baking. The Breville whips through any baking task with little effort and could inspire you to bake more than the once-a-year birthday cake or Christmas cookies.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-HM-90S-Advantage-9-Speed-Handheld/dp/B0034A8C4O/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; HM-90S</a> is about one-third less expensive than the Breville, and although it doesn’t quite match Breville’s outstanding performance, it’s nonetheless a very good hand mixer for the price.</p>
<p>It has nine speeds, each one noticeably increasing at small increments, which gave us a real sense of control. The three slow speeds are indeed very slow and were great for incorporating flour and sugar without any splatter. We didn’t find much difference between the middle speeds and settled at speed 5 as the most effective, particularly for whipping potatoes.</p>
<p>Cuisinart’s instruction manual helpfully suggests speeds and attachments for certain foods, which we tested out. The suggestions proved to be mostly accurate, although we did find that increasing the suggested speed by one level gave us quicker results.</p>

You can count on thorough coverage in the bowl due to the Cuisinart's longer and wider beaters.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0034A8C4O/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The mixer fits comfortably into the grip of your hand, and although the power button might be slightly too high up to reach for some people’s thumbs, the speed control buttons are at thumb level. The mixer’s speed automatically reset at level 1 each time it’s turned off, and there’s a bit of a surge before it adjusts to the actual speed level. Once we got used to that, it didn’t present a problem; we simply waited for a second or two before lowering the beaters into the bowl.</p>
<p>Maneuverability is excellent, thanks to the mixer’s lightweight and a swivel base for the electric cord, so you can move around the mixing bowl without the cord getting in your way.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has the usual attachments (including a nifty little bowl scraper), but the beaters are longer and wider than those of other mixers we tested, which gave us great coverage in the mixing bowl when blending the cake batter. As with most of the mixers, a snap-on storage case for the attachments is a welcome addition.</p>

<p>The Cuisinart performed well in all of the tests, and as was the case with the Breville, the dough hooks efficiently combined the dough ingredients but had trouble keeping the dough in the bowl during the kneading process, even at the slowest speed.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart is still a bit expensive for a hand mixer, but it’s very well made and is sure to last. It comes with a three-year warranty, which is remarkable for a kitchen appliance (most are one-year), and any replacement parts are readily available and not expensive. If you don’t want to shell out big bucks for the Breville, then we recommend the Cuisinart HM-90S as our second-place winner.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; HM-90S is compact yet powerful with plenty of speed to plow through thick doughs and whip egg whites and cream in under two minutes.</li>
<li>Its stainless steel attachments are sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart’s three-year warranty is unique for a hand mixer.</li>
<li>It’s a bit pricey, but it’s durable and designed to last for years.</li>

<p>The majority of hand mixers we tested run in the $15 to $20 range, and the best of them was definitely the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XCCULW/?tag-ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster &#8211; 2500</a>. At 240-watts, the Oster is actually a bit more powerful than our runner-up, the Cuisinart HM-90S. It has five speeds, each of which is clearly differentiated, unlike most nine-speed models.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XCCULW/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oster-mixer-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oster-mixer-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oster-mixer-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oster-mixer-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oster-mixer-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oster-mixer-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oster-mixer-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oster-mixer-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oster-mixer-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Budget pick: Oster - 2500</h3><p>At a fraction of the cost, this sturdy hand mixer has the power to whip fluffy egg whites and silky-smooth potatoes that comparable models don’t. Our testers appreciated its distinctive five speeds, which proved plenty effective to get the job done.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XCCULW/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Oster is a bit larger and heavier than the other hand mixers we tested, and in some ways, reminds of us of the hand mixer our mother (or even grandmother) might use. The beaters are made of chrome and are thicker, like the old-fashioned models, intended for creaming butter and mixing thick cookie or bread doughs. The beaters were a little more difficult to clean, but they gave us good volume with egg whites in one minute and smooth blending of pizza dough.</p>
<p>Of the competition, its slowest speed didn’t splatter dry ingredients, and at the fastest speed, it tore through the potatoes like a little motor boat.</p>
<p>The Oster is a little heavy in the hand, so it may not be ideal for people who have hand or wrist weakness. We also found the chrome lever for adjusting speeds and the eject button to be stiff.</p>
<p>These quibbles don’t stand in the way, however, of our recommending this hand mixer as a good product at a great price.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Oster &#8211; 2500 is more powerful than the other comparably priced mixers we tested.</li>
<li>Its large beaters gave excellent volume to egg whites and whipping cream.</li>
<li>Each of the Oster’s five speeds is precisely differentiated from lowest to highest.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C9OQ47S/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KHM926WH </a>is another 9-speed hand mixer and shares several features with the Breville. It fits nicely in the hand and has also been designed for easy operation and maneuverability.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to like about the KitchenAid. Its large wire whisk is efficient and added good volume to the egg whites and whipping cream. We also found it helpful that the chassis is marked with symbols for how the attachments should be inserted. Oddly, the KitchenAid’s eject button isn’t marked.</p>
<p>However, as we found with the other mixers, its nine speed levels aren’t differentiated much to matter, since each increment between speeds is minimal. Its lowest levels were lower than the other mixers, and its highest levels were too high, splattering anything we attempted to mix.</p>
<p>The KitchenAid &#8211; KHM926WH is comparable in price to the Cuisinart, which in our testing, we found to be superior.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N3L2AN8/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 62650A </a>has many of the same features as the other hand mixers we tested: beaters and whisk attachments, snap-on storage case and good wattage (250 watts). It’s got six speeds with not much difference between speeds three and four, but the lowest speed and the highest speed are much too high for incorporating dry ingredients or mixing anything without splatter.</p>
<p>Its lever for changing speeds is awkwardly placed, so you really need to stretch your thumb high up on the mixer to reach the upper speed levels. It doesn’t have a separate eject button, but instead eject is done by pushing on the speed lever, which can stick. The Hamilton Beach &#8211; 62650A is certainly reasonably priced, and we did like its unique bowl rest feature on the base of the mixer, but for a bargain-priced option, we’d recommend the Oster &#8211; 2500 instead.</p>

<p>We really wanted to love the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vremi-Electric-Mixer-Built-Storage/dp/B01I1RQ2GY/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vremi &#8211; VRM010008N</a>. First of all, it’s adorable. The Vremi is a tiny candy-apple red hand mixer with 150 watts. It’s compact, could fit in a drawer and designed so its beaters (the Vremi’s only accessories) fit right into the chassis of the mixer. The Vremi is very lightweight and can whizz around a mixing bowl with no effort.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, its low wattage does this little mixer in. The Vremi has the flaws of some of the other mixers we tested. Its speed button is difficult to move while you’re mixing something, and the low speed splatters dry ingredients everywhere. Even at its highest speed, the Vremi struggled to plump up the egg whites and whipping cream.</p>
<p>The Vremi is an inexpensive option for a tiny kitchen.  But its low wattage increases the time and effort in doing basic baking tasks.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-6-Speed-Attachments-MX3200B/dp/B00BIBBIH4/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; MX3200B</a> has little differentiation between the speeds. Although it has six speed settings, in actuality, it’s a three-speed mixer — the two lows, mediums and highs are virtually the same.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker did a nice job in whipping the egg whites, and it creamed the potatoes to a smooth consistency. We found there was a lot of splatter, however, even at its lowest speed. Oddly, the mixer doesn’t stand up easily on its end, so we had to balance it against the mixing bowl. The Black+Decker was, by far, the loudest of the mixers we tested.</p>
<p>It has a plastic storage case for the entire mixer, which no other mixer we tested had, and it’s reasonably priced. But since the Black+Decker’s lowest speed isn’t low enough to prevent splatter of dry ingredients, we believe you should buy our budget pick, the Oster &#8211; 2500, instead.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Whether you’re a frequent or occasional baker, you’ll want a hand mixer that is reliable, durable and performs all the necessary tasks for baking fluffy cakes and breads and whipping lighter-than-air cream with minimal effort.</p>
<p>We gave our test subjects a rigorous work-out and feel confident that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BHM800SIL-Handy-Scraper-Silver/dp/B00XBOXUWC/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BHM800SIL</a> is unquestionably the best hand mixer you could buy. Its smart design features — like a scrolling-wheel speed changer, mixer light, silicone-coated beaters, extra wire whisk — are worth the Breville’s higher price.</p>
<p>If you want a high-quality mixer that’s not as expensive, we recommend our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-HM-90S-Advantage-9-Speed-Handheld/dp/B0034A8C4O/?tag=ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; HM-90S</a>. It’s also a great performer, and you really can’t beat Cuisinart’s three-year warranty.</p>
<p>For under $20, our budget pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XCCULW/?tag-ybdhamx-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oster &#8211; 2500</a> is a sturdy mixer with five clearly differentiated speeds, giving you a true low for splatter-less mixing and blending.</p>
