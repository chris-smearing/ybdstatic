				<description><![CDATA[Our team of testers carried six bags for 12,000 steps and tested five factors before choosing the Boost as the best gym bag with a shoe compartment.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur team of testers took 12,000 steps and 12 trips to the gym in pursuit of the best gym bag with a shoe compartment. After a week of side-by-side testing, we determined that the best overall is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boost &#8211; Sports Gym Bag</a>. It’s inexpensive yet sturdy, water-resistant and provides the most enjoyable day-long carrying experience. Close behind was the roomy, durable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011R5MHKC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas &#8211; Team Issue</a>, best for athletes and outdoor exercisers.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>The market for gym bags is filled with great products in wildly varied size and price ranges. To narrow our testing field, we set our budget at 50 dollars and only looked for bags with excellent average review ratings at the usual online retailers.</p>
<p>From there, we checked lists from Men’s Health, Wirecutter and NY Magazine. When we found a bag that was on multiple lists and met both our buyer-rating and budget criteria, we added it to a shortlist for testing.</p>
<p>Finally, we talked to our gym-going colleagues and friends to find out which bags they use and love. Our final list is made up of high-quality, inexpensive, well-loved bags that have the features to make your trips to the gym more productive and maybe even less smelly.</p>
<h2 id="lineup">Compare the best gym bags</h2>
[table id=328 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>We chose gym bags specifically with shoe compartments to test, and that distinction naturally lent itself to at least medium-sized bags. Our goal was to find a bag comfortable enough to carry, but big enough to fit not only our shoes and gym outfits, but also toiletries and cosmetics, a change of clothes, a full water bottle and one specialty equipment item (we chose boxing gloves). If walking to the gym, you may want a smaller bag like the gym-friendly pick in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-laptop-backpack/#17-inch-pick">Laptop Backpack review</a>. If transporting large equipment, you&#8217;ll want to check out larger bags.</p>
<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>Depending on the weight of the equipment you’re carrying and the distance you have to travel with your gym bag, you’ll likely want as lightweight a bag as possible. If you’re opting for a heavier bag for either style or sturdiness, you’ll want to make sure the bag’s straps are adequately padded. All the gym bags we tested are two pounds or fewer, with the exception of the Everest.</p>
<h3>Material</h3>
<p>We looked for a bag that we were confident could last and remain fresh for a long time. We considered material type (body of the bag and zippers included), which influences how much weight a bag can bear, how susceptible it is to tearing and its breathability.</p>
<p>Generally, gym bags with shoe compartments are made of nylon (often laminated and less breathable), polyester (more breathable), or some combination of the two. The strongest bags in our bunch were blends. In the case of our top pick, different weaves are added to the mix, but a backing is still present to keep out water.</p>
<p>You should also note that breathable fabric also allows water in. Nylon technically gets soggy more than polyester if you let it sit in the rain, but it&#8217;s the rubbery backing that keeps your clothes dry inside.</p>
<p>To mitigate the effect a waterproof bag might have on the smells trapped inside, find a bag that includes a vented shoe compartment.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>Most gym bags with a shoe compartment will do a fairly decent job of holding everything you need. What sets the great apart from the good is a bag’s ability to organize. The amount, size and arrangement of pockets can make a huge difference in how functional a gym bag is. When working out under a time constraint, digging for the items you need can be incredibly frustrating. Check for pocket numbers and layouts that will make your life easier, not harder.</p>
[table id=330 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Over the course of a week, we tested six different bags  on our commutes and in our gyms. We standardized our packing lists to include sneakers, clothes for working out, a change of street clothes, cosmetics, a water bottle, electronics, keys and a pair of boxing gloves.</p>
<h3>Packing and functionality</h3>
<p>Our picks ranged from four pockets to nine (with the shoe compartment included), with the Mier &#8211; 20 inches Sports Gym bag at the lowest end and the Everest &#8211; Gym Bag with Wet Pocket at the highest. The latter became our organizational favorite, but still wasn’t our top pick overall.</p>
<p>As we packed for each of our trips to the gym, we used our standardized packing list to establish a preference for one gym bag over another. We wanted to know which bag was the best organizational help and which felt like a bottomless pit. Packing and using the same gear for our trips gave us a clear indicator which bags we liked to use best.</p>
[table id=329 /]
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>Each gym bag accompanied our team members on their individual commutes, but each bag was also taken for a roughly 2,000 step journey to compare comfort levels. We rated the comfort level of each bag on a star system, where one is “ too uncomfortable to use again,” two is “became very uncomfortable quickly”, three is “pretty comfortable”  and four is “no discomfort at all.”</p>
<p>Because different testers can comfortably carry different weights, potentially influencing this test, we also made a more direct assessment of strap padding.</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25398" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key.jpg" alt="Testing abrasion resistance with a key" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We left each bag hanging with 30 pounds inside for one hour to test the strength of straps, buckles and zippers. Next, we applied a scratch test. For the scratch test, we took a key and scraped the outside and the lining of each bag with varying degrees of pressure (first soft, then firm, then as hard as possible) and recorded any tears or permanent scratches.</p>
<h3>Breathability and smell</h3>
<p>To test how well our bags dealt with moisture and smell, we performed two tests. For the first test, we kept our dirty gym clothes in the bag for a full eight hours, and after taking the clothes out, noted how long the bag retained its dirty smell. We unzipped each bag but did not fully open them, and checked in at the half hour, hour and two hour mark.</p>
<p>For the second, we muddied an old pair of sneakers and put them into the designated shoe compartment. Then, we checked back in an hour to see if the mud was dry. We also checked to see if we could smell the shoes from the outside of the bag from both a foot away and right next to the bag.</p>
<p>Our goal was to find a gym bag that resisted odors entirely, but it became clear that this was unrealistic, so we placed greater emphasis on the second test and the breathability of a bag’s shoe compartment.</p>
<h3>Water resistance</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25397" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water.jpg" alt="Testing waterproofing" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We also poured a cup of water directly onto our bags to test claims of water resistance or waterproof-ness. For bags claiming to be only water resistant, we accepted damp clothes as a result, but not wet ones. Waterproof bags needed to keep clothes inside completely dry.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>If you’re carrying specialized equipment that sees a lot of outdoor use, you’ll want a gym bag with a shoe compartment that cleans easily. As a final test, we gave each of our gym bags a thorough cleaning with wipes to compare maintenance effort.</p>
<p>We counted how many wipes it took to clean each bag, checked to see if mud remained in nooks and crannies after a single cleaning pass and gave extra kudos for machine washable bags.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Boost</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25402" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Boost.jpg" alt="Boost" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Our tests to find the best gym bag with shoe compartment confirmed our initial intuition; many of these bags are excellent, and this was a tough race. Ultimately, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boost</a> proved itself as our favorite with its attention to detail, overall functionality and affordable price.</p>
<p>The Boost gym bag was near the top of our list for functionality thanks to its structure and layout; it has five total pockets (including the shoe compartment), and one is meant specifically for holding wet clothes or swimsuits. It has no designated place for toiletries, but our team was satisfied storing those in the front pocket. On the side is a mesh bottle pocket we found perfect for holding the full range of sizes we&#8217;ve tested in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">water bottle review</a>, and the shoe compartment was vented, which helped it perform well in our breathability and smell test.</p>
<p>In terms of comfort, we loved the Boost gym bag for its comfortable straps, and for the way its shape helps it stay easy to carry on long trips. The unique (among this group of bags) textured material – a nylon-blend oxford weave – made the bag feel more luxurious.</p>

Its thoughtful design makes the Boost a great, functional companion for the gym</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Performing well on our durability test was an absolute must, and the Boost gym bag did not disappoint. We thought its unique fabric texture might rip easily, but no amount of pressure in our scratch test damaged the bag. In the weighted hanging test, we found that the reinforced seams and metal clasps held the load without trouble. The added reinforcement on the bottom of the bag and its water-resistant (though not waterproof) outside ensure this bag will last a long time.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Boost &#8211; Sports Gym Bag excels in combining versatile functionality with subtle style.</li>
<li>If you need a fully waterproof gym bag, you’ll need to look elsewhere (like the runner-up from Adidas), but this bag can handle a bit of water, and can keep wet clothes separate.</li>
<li>The relatively low price and high durability of this gym bag make it ideal for long term use without making a big investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="runner-up">Runner up: Adidas</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25401" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Adidas.jpg" alt="Adidas" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011R5MHKC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas &#8211; Team Issue</a> came highly recommended not only by a number of review websites, but also by some trusted friends and colleagues who swore by its longevity and spaciousness. Our team found that it lived up to its reputation, but fell slightly short in terms of functionality.</p>
<p>The main pro of the Adidas bag is that it combines lightweight comfort with durability. We knew from other tests that this bag would be durable, but from the way the fabric blend (nylon, polyester and elastane) felt in our hands, and considering the bag weighs less than two pounds, we were surprised by how well it stood up to abuse.</p>
<p>In our durability tests, this bag performed extremely well. The straps barely strained holding 30 pounds for an hour, and no amount of scratching (on any of the distinct fabric types) left a lasting mark. It comes with a lifetime guarantee, but we don’t think you’ll need to use it.</p>
<p>It’s the elastane in the fabric mix that gives this bag its stretch and lightweight feel, and the nylon provides a fair degree of water resistance, especially on the reinforced bottom. We found too that the lining of this bag was great at repelling moisture — lugging around wet clothes or swimsuits won’t be an issue, nor would setting this bag down in a puddle on the locker room floor.</p>

<p>Our Adidas gym bag was slightly quicker to clean than our top pick and also included a vented shoe compartment, which we liked for our muddy shoes and sweaty clothes. Even with five total pockets, though, its spartan functionality (or lack thereof) knocked it to number two on our list.</p>
<p>Despite a small toiletries section, the main pocket felt way too disorganized. With almost no structure (and no water bottle pocket), we found that our items continued to slide around in transit, knocking our attempts at organization further out of alignment.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Adidas &#8211; Team Issue is a great bag for athletes because of its easy cleanability and cavernous design.</li>
<li>For a busy, everyday gym-goer, this bag’s lack of structured organization made finding things too difficult.</li>
<li>The mix of durability and light weight this bag provides makes it a comfortable way to lug your gym gear that will last a long time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-other-finalists">The other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>Coreal</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25403" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Coreal.jpg" alt="Coreal" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTPM7MC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coreal &#8211; Sport Gym Bag</a> is another gym bag that makes great use of its pockets. High functionality combined with a fully waterproof shell almost earned it a top spot.</p>
<p>We found this bag to be spacious yet organized and especially liked the side pockets. A dedicated water bottle pocket seems like it should be a prerequisite for a good gym bag, but not all of our picks had one, so we appreciated Coreal for including theirs. This bag passed our packing functionality test easily.</p>
<p>The most fully waterproof of all our finalists, we felt so confident in this bag’s impenetrability that one of our testers took it into a torrential downpour. It protected the contents inside and proved its worth even further.</p>
<p>A completely waterproof shell does come with one main drawback, however, and that is the Coreal gym bag’s complete lack of breathability. The bag is mainly waterproofed ripstop nylon, and the shoe compartment has no vent. During our testing, we noticed that our muddy shoes were not dry after an hour and that the Coreal bag retained the smell of our sweaty gym clothes overnight.</p>
<p>If you live in an especially wet climate, or favor swimming as your exercise of choice, this orderly, highly waterproof bag is perfect. If, on the other hand, you aren’t keen on at least wiping down your gym bag after every use, more breathable designs on this list may serve you better.</p>
<h3>Everest</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25394" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Everest.jpg" alt="Everest" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F3FVTC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Everest</a> was the top of Wirecutter’s list of best gym bags for a while before they reconsidered due to durability issues. Likewise, a number of other sites and friends suggested giving this bag a try, and it performed well until our durability test, where it ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Nine pockets (including shoe compartment) make it very easy to put everything in exactly the right place when using this bag; there is even an extra water bottle pocket, which would be great for bringing coffee or tea during a commute to an early morning workout. The inside compartment of the Everest gym bag is smartly divided and we especially liked that it included both a wet-item pocket and a pocket for toiletries and cosmetics. We felt that this bag could have easily held double our packing list and remained high in our functionality ranks; there really is a place for everything.</p>
<p>This bag may not be waterproof and is barely water resistant – our clothes were definitely damp after we did our water test – but it did a great job at not holding onto odors. While the lining of the main compartment was a little more difficult to clean than others, we had no trouble wiping the shoe compartment of its mud thanks to its more water-resistant material.</p>
<p>Where the Everest gym bag lost our testers was in its durability testing; even before applying full pressure, we were able to tear the polyester canvas on the outside of the bag. During the hanging test, we also saw that the seams were straining and were worried they might pop; our top three gym bags with shoe compartments performed much better.</p>
<p>Our testers also found that the sub-par straps on the Everest bag less comfortable to travel on their shoulder than most other bags on this list. Though Everest provides padding for the long strap, we found it to be insufficient. This gym bag will serve you really well for a while, but if you have to walk far with the bag or expect to have it for a long time, you may want to reconsider.</p>
<h3>G4free</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25395" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/G4free.jpg" alt="G4free" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>A few of our testers prefer backpacks over duffels, so were excited to give the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KV96XFU/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">G4Free &#8211; 3-Way 40L</a> convertible backpack a try, thinking it would be more comfortable.</p>
<p>While we found this bag to be high on our functionality list – it’s convertible and has lots of organization features – we were disappointed to find that the padding for the duffel strap was much more substantial than the padding for the backpack straps. This makes carrying the G4free less comfortable as a backpack than it should be.</p>
<p>When performing the weighted hanging test with this bag, we did separate tests for the duffel straps and the backpack straps. The duffel straps performed well, but the backpack straps did not. Though it’s likely the backpack straps were made thinner to make sure they tuck into their pocket during conversion, we thought a bit more reinforcement wouldn’t hurt. Our key also made some faint marks during the scratch test portion of our durability investigation.</p>
<p>Pluses of this bag include its lightweight design and its waterproof shell; like the Coreal gym bag, though, the shoe compartment was not vented and made for wet, muddy and smelly sneakers. We appreciated the addition of a toiletries pocket, but missed the water bottle pocket.</p>
<h3>Mier</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25399" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mier.jpg" alt="Mier" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Our testers might have marked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A4Z4VC8/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mier &#8211; SPO002</a> higher if other products on this list hadn’t been so excellent. As a gym bag with shoe compartment, it’s perfectly adequate, but has nothing to set it apart from the rest.</p>
<p>We were excited by the structure in this bag, a factor which usually makes packing easier, but with only four total pockets, we felt like some of our smaller items had nowhere to go where they wouldn’t get lost. This alone doesn’t make this bag our least favorite, but combined with its poor performance during other tests, it didn’t quite live up to expectations. There is almost no padding on the straps (which struggled as a whole throughout testing) to provide comfort and we quite easily put marks in the nylon material of this bag during our scratch test. Other gym bags jumped ahead quickly in the rankings.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>During our testing, we looked for a gym bag with excellent features that could be had for under 50 dollars, and the competition was quite close.</p>
<p>Our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boost &#8211; Sports Gym Bag</a>, earned its number one spot by passing all of our durability tests and particularly wowing our testers in packing functionality and comfort.</p>
<p>We placed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011R5MHKC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas &#8211; Team Issue</a> in a very close second place, and it’s a great choice for sports equipment. The high quality of this bag means you may never have to replace it.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After testing four top-ranked options, the Brita - BB10 won our pick as the best filtered water bottle for safe-to-drink city water.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter using four top-ranked bottles at home, on the go and in the great outdoors, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H1F6N2F/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; BB10</a> won our pick as the best filtered water bottle for better taste from safe-to-drink city water. If you&#8217;re going out into the wilderness, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C6HAYCS/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grayl &#8211; Ultralight</a> is a purifying water bottle that removes organisms like bacteria and protozoa, as well as mineral contaminants like heavy metals.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve tested a lot of water filters over the years, including <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">the best water filter pitchers</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-faucet-water-filter/">faucet filters</a>. Our staff has come to appreciate the taste of chlorine-free drinking water without the added expense of buying bottled water.</p>
<p>We looked for systems in two different classes:</p>
<p>First, we looked at filters that were designed to remove only bad-tasting elements like chlorine from treated, safe-to-drink water. The standards for this type of filter are fairly easy to meet, but they&#8217;re specific. An activated carbon block or column of granules will capture most of the stuff you can smell in city water.</p>
<p>Second, we looked at bottles designed for use in the back country and overseas travel, where the concern is more for biological contamination than taste. We consulted guides from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Center for Disease Control</a> and <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/pubs/pdf/hi_res/07231304hi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forest Service</a> to ensure we were checking for the right factors.</p>
<p>We narrowed our choices to bottles that had affordable replacement filters and were easy to purchase. A few other picks, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075X5R67T/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Katadyn &#8211; BeFree</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078WYNCZ5/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LifeSaver</a>, weren&#8217;t available when we tested and weren&#8217;t competitive with the LifeStraw on pricing despite using similar technologies.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Carbon filters</strong> &#8211; If you want a filter to remove the taste of chlorine and other volatile substances, activated carbon is economical and very effective. It isn&#8217;t effective at removing dissolved minerals, though, and the size of particles carbon passes through will depend on the design. Carbon filters soak up less and less contaminants the more they&#8217;re used, and they can&#8217;t be cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>Ion-exchange filters</strong> &#8211; If you want to remove the dissolved salts and metals in water, ion-exchange resin will grab them. Some new tests also show that this works to capture microbial contaminants. This is one of the technologies used in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">Zero Water filter pitchers</a> to get rid of all dissolved solids. Like activated carbon, the filter is used up as it cleans water, but you can&#8217;t tell how much it has left unless you count the number of times you fill the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Particle filters</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re mostly worried about avoiding beaver fever while backpacking, a hollow-fiber or ceramic filter can be effective at removing everything from silt to tiny virus and bacteria organisms, depending on the size of the holes. In the extra-dense microbiological filters they require hand-pump pressure or hours-long gravity filtration to make questionable water safe. These filters are fairly easy to clean and continue using for a long time, but they don&#8217;t do much to improve the taste of city water or if you use treatment drops.</p>
<p><strong>Particulate ratings</strong> &#8211; NSF International and other water quality testers rate filters based on the largest compounds they can possibly let through. A smaller class number or absolute filter size will be more effective, but it will also stop working more quickly. Class I is the important class, since this means the filter stops particles larger than 0.5 microns, and that category includes some of the most worrisome organisms in mountain streams.</p>
<p><strong>Effectiveness against biological contaminants</strong> &#8211; Class I particulate ratings — or better still, testing that shows compliance with the NSF Standard 53 or 58 for “cyst reduction / removal” — mean filters can trap protozoan cysts like giardia or cryptosporidium. However, these filters might still let some bacteria (which can be as small as 0.2 microns) through. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC highly recommends</a> using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XVMZG2/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chlorine dioxide treatment</a> or just boiling water before you filter it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re travelling in populated areas, virus-size organisms are a bigger concern and require an even tighter, slower filter that meets <a href="https://www.msrgear.com/blog/water-101-decoding-water-filter-testing-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the strict P248 standard</a> for worst-case water supplies. That kind of filter requires a high-pressure hand pump or a slow gravity-drain mechanism.</p>
<p>Bottles like Grayl and Seychelle claim to be effective at removing viruses with ion-exchange filters, but they don&#8217;t publish the specifications of their tests and they&#8217;re definitely not P248-rated.</p>
<p><strong>Flow rating</strong> &#8211; The more quickly water flows through a filter, the easier it is to use. That&#8217;s almost always a trade-off with effectiveness, though. Also remember that if you use water that&#8217;s cloudy, the particles will plug up your filter more quickly and reduce the flow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hether you’re using them during a sweat session at the gym or to get through a hot summer day, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3017491/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> show that cooling towels can significantly boost endurance levels. We put five top-rated cooling towels to the test to determine which ones perform best, wearing them while doing housework on a hot day, outside in the heat of the sun and during a workout at the gym.</p>
<p>The best cooling towel was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel</a>, a highly absorbent towel that kept us cool and comfortable for a span of two consecutive hours. We also chose the best cooling towel for sports — the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel</a>, a mesh poly blend towel that felt especially lightweight and breathable as it cooled us off during our gym time.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected cooling towels to test</h2>
<p>To put together our lineup of test-worthy cooling towels, we first looked over the top-rated best-sellers on Amazon and searched for user recommendations on Reddit and YouTube. We also read through buyer reviews on Amazon to determine what cooling towel features were most important to users, which we then used to filter and narrow down the top towel choices on our list.</p>
<p>Out of those top picks, we chose towels that were highly rated on Amazon and under $30 each. We also made sure to test a variety of fabrics and materials — polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), 100% polyester and polyester-nylon blends — to determine which were most effective at cooling us down.</p>
<p>The final filtered list included two cooling towel giants: the ShamWow-like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IAUZ3LS/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frogg Toggs &#8211; Chilly Pad</a> and two cooling towels by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q7T3C3T/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mission</a>, an “instant cooling gear” brand touted by big-name athlete ambassadors like Serena Williams and Dwayne Wade. The other two brands, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal</a>, were dark horses by comparison, but were highly rated on Amazon and had received raves in YouTube and Reddit reviews.</p>

<h2 id="how-they-work">How do cooling towels work?</h2>
<p>When a moistened cooling towel is placed around the neck or on any skin surface, evaporative cooling comes into play — the skin’s temperature causes the towel’s moisture particles to heat up and evaporate, further cooling down the temperature of the towel. The result is a refreshingly cooling feeling against the skin.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3017491/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> published in the <i>Journal of Athletic Training</i> found that those who wore a cooling towel during exercise could endure the workout longer because it changed the participants’ perception of how much thermal strain they were experiencing. In our own research, we found that cooling towels seem to be used by everyone from gym enthusiasts and festival-goers to menopausal women battling hot flashes and mothers giving birth.</p>
<p>Ideal for vacationers, golfers and those who work outside or in perpetually hot environments (such as chefs), cooling towels seem to take the edge off of a variety of overheated situations and help keep wearers cool during the summer months.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Fabric</h3>
<p>The fabric of the cooling towel you choose will depend largely on how you intend to use your towel. If you want to cool off without soaking your clothes, polyvinyl acetate (PVA) towels like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel</a> are great because they will retain moisture and cool you off without sacrificing your outfit. Mesh polyester blend or 100-percent polyester towels such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F6R5J9S/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mission &#8211; Enduracool Techknit Cooling Towel</a> have a wetter feel and tend to be drippier, so they’re better for use at the gym, during a sports activity or in any situation where you don’t mind your clothes getting a little wet.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Cooling towels come in a variety of sizes, with some brands (such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel</a>) offering a broader range than others. A small-to-medium size (about 10–13 inches by 32–40 inches) is perfect for wearing around the neck during a workout. Larger-sized towels (14–30 inches by 41–60 inches) are great for keeping the entire body cool — after sports events, during heat waves, etc. Many cooling towels offer UPF sun protection, making them perfect for draping over the shoulders while outside in the sun.</p>
<h3>Washability and storage</h3>
<p>Since you will most likely want to wash your cooling towel often, it’s a good idea to pick one that can be conveniently thrown into the washing machine.</p>
<p>PVA fans, take heed: Since PVA dries to a hard, cardboard-like finish, you’ll want to wash your towel and then fold or roll it up while still wet. Attempting to fold or roll your towel after it dries may result in tearing. If you don’t need to fold or roll your towel for storage, feel free to lay it out flat to dry.</p>
<p>Some cooling towels come with storage pouches and even hooks to attach to your gym bag or backpack for easy transportation while wet or dry.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To determine the best cooling towels out of our top five picks, our testers wore each towel around their neck and shoulders for a span of two consecutive hours while doing housework and yard work. We also wore them during gym sessions to find out how well they cooled us down while we were hot and sweaty. Our testers then rated the towels using the following criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>After wetting/activating the cooling towel with room-temperature water, how long does it actually stay cool?</li>

<p>Our pick for best cooling towel overall is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel</a>, which remained moist and cool throughout our testing periods, didn’t get our clothes wet and was soft and comfortable to wear. Made of cushy polyvinyl acetate (PVA), the Chill Pal feels buttery against the skin, with one side textured and the other smooth. Its 12 inch by 32 inch size was ideal for draping easily around our neck or over our shoulders.</p>
<p>After soaking it in water and wringing it out according to the directions, the towel immediately felt cool against our neck and retained that coolness for the next hour of use. In the hour following that, the towel did begin to warm slightly, but we were impressed by how long it remained moist — well beyond our two-hour consecutive testing period — and even more impressed that it only lightly dampened our shirt during that time.</p>

<p>As a PVA cooling towel, the Chill Pal dries stiff. Though it can be washed cold in the washing machine, it shouldn’t be dried in the dryer. We recommend folding or rolling the towel while it’s still moist and pliable, and then air-drying it to prevent molding before storing it in its pouch.</p>
<p>Priced at about $13, the Chill Pal comes with a storage pouch and carabiner, so it can be clipped onto your bag or backpack before and after use. Because it does an excellent job of cooling the body down without soaking your outfit, we recommend it for those who need to cool down at work, while out and about on a hot day (Disneyland, anyone?) or during house and yard work.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel impressed us with its marathon moisture retention.</li>
<li>The towel remained cool longer than any of the others in our testing lineup.</li>
<li>Because it leaches little to no water onto clothing, the Chill Pal is ideal for use at work or in situations where you need to preserve your outfit.</li>
<li>Since it dries stiff, you need to air dry and roll it up while it is still pliable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lightweight, soft and breathable, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel</a> is our top choice for a cooling towel to use while at the gym or during sports. After we “activated” (wet) the towel with water, it remained cool against our skin throughout our hour-long workout.</p>
<p>Made of 45% polyester and 55% polyamide mesh, the Alfamo is not as absorbent as the Chill Pal PVA towel and therefore doesn’t distribute moisture evenly throughout the towel for long, making it a bit drippy. However, we found the wetter quality of the towel to be especially refreshing while working out and a non-issue for gym clothes, since we were already sweaty. We also like that the Alfamo offers UPF 50 sun protection, which will come in handy for those who exercise outdoors.</p>

<p>The Alfamo gets extra points for its sizing variety; while the other towels in our lineup only come in one or two sizes, Alfamo offers four different sizes: 11 by 33 inches, 13 by 40 inches, 14 by 47 inches and 29 by 60 inches, priced from around $8 for the smallest size to about $27 for the largest.</p>
<p>Like the Chill Pal towel, the Alfamo comes with a waterproof storage pouch and carabiner for easy transportability. The towel is machine washable, and can be dried in the dryer on low heat. Bonus: Alfamo also offers a lifetime guarantee on their towels.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Light and breathable, the Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel was the perfect weight to wear while exercising.</li>
<li>The towel’s polyester blend delivered slightly more moisture when wet, which provided extra cooling power during sweaty workouts.</li>
<li>The Alfamo offers four different sizes to wear around the neck, shoulders, torso or entire body.</li>
<li>It’s not as absorbent as PVA towels, meaning it’s a bit drippy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After testing five highly rated cooling towels indoors, outdoors and at the gym, we narrowed our picks down to two favorites. Our favorite cooling towel overall, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel</a>, holds moisture for an impressive amount of time without leaking onto clothes, cooling us off for two hours straight and keeping our outfit intact. For sports and working out, we recommend the airy, mesh <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen it comes to trimming and shaving the delicate bikini area, gentle grooming tools are key — especially for those with sensitive skin. With the help of tender-skinned, irritation-prone testers, we tried out eight of the highest-rated bikini trimmers and bikini razors on the market and selected three standout performers.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler</a>, a men’s body trimmer with an easy-to-maneuver body and small trimmer head, turned out to be ideal for the bikini area. Our runner-up was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>, a women’s trimmer that cuts hair effortlessly and also wins points for its light, ergonomic design. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men’s Razor</a>, another men’s tool, won in the best bikini razor category for its narrow head and extra-close yet gentle shave.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We kicked off our research with a visit to Amazon to find out which bikini trimmers and razors were rated the highest by users and why. Then we compiled a list of the features most sought after by women in a trimmer or razor.</p>
<p>Reading through subreddits, trusted product review sites and Amazon customer reviews helped pinpoint the problems faced by users with sensitive skin, as well as the tools they’d personally tried that had provided the smoothest trim or shave with the least irritation.</p>
<p>Given the volume of discussion surrounding how to minimize irritation while trimming and shaving sensitive skin, we decided to dedicate a separate category to the best bikini trimmers and razors for sensitive skin. We also consulted with cosmetologist and skincare expert <a href="https://www.facebook.com/brushedbysabrina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabrina Orchid</a> about her trimming and shaving best practices, and how to avoid irritation.</p>
<p>Once we were fully educated and up to speed on bikini hair removal, we selected five trimmers (three of them designed especially for sensitive skin) and three razors that boasted high customer ratings on Amazon and checked the boxes of our desired features: affordable tools that were easy to hold and maneuver and delivered a quick, close yet gentle shave or trim with minimal nicks or irritation.</p>
<h2 id="pink-tax">Are men’s grooming products better?</h2>
<p>While researching women’s bikini trimmers and razors, it was impossible to ignore the number of men’s grooming tools that had received high ratings from women for delivering a smooth, nick-free trim or shave specifically in the bikini area. These products often outranked women’s trimmers and razors designed especially for the pubic area.</p>
<p>This observation begged the inevitable question: Do men’s grooming products deliver a higher quality trim/shave than women’s products? (Spoiler: The answer is <b>yes</b>, according to our tests. Scroll down to see our testing results.) Consumer Reports even <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/electric-razors/buying-guide/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> in their Electric Razor Buying Guide that they’ve chosen not to test any women’s models because they had performed relatively poorly in trials — but that there was no reason why women couldn’t use men’s shavers (insert side-eye here).</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/partners/Study-of-Gender-Pricing-in-NYC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> published in 2015 by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, women pay an average of 13 percent more than men for equivalent personal care products and an average of 11 percent more for women’s razor cartridges than men’s cartridges. This phenomenon, dubbed the Pink Tax, has stirred up a good amount of outrage.</p>
<p>A quick search online unearthed long and heated subreddit discussions regarding the superiority of men’s grooming products over women’s — often for a fraction of the price. This was also a recurring theme in Amazon customer reviews of men’s body hair trimmers and razors, in which women often raved about how much better the product in question had performed in comparison to those specifically designed for women.</p>
<p>Women’s brands clearly have some catching up to do when it comes to bikini trimmers and razors. In the meantime, we decided to include three highly rated men’s trimmers and razors (which also passed our testing criteria with flying colors) in our pool of contenders.</p>

<h3>Bikini trimmers</h3>
[table id=307 /]
<h3>Bikini razors</h3>
[table id=308 /]
<h2 id="versus">Bikini trimmers vs. bikini razors</h2>
<h3>Bikini trimmers</h3>
<p>Because trimmers cut hair <i>above</i> the skin, without the blade actually coming in contact with the skin, they’re a great choice for women with sensitive skin. There’s no razor burn to worry about, a smaller chance of irritation or ingrown hairs and virtually zero chance of cutting yourself. With trimmers, women can keep the bikini region neat and groomed without shaving everything off. However, though you can usually choose a hair length setting, you’ll never be able to cut your hair as close as you can with a razor.</p>
<h3>Bikini razors</h3>
<p>For the purpose of this article, we’re going to focus on the two types of razors best suited for the sensitive bikini area: cartridge razors and electric foil shavers.</p>
<p>Cartridge razors come in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3-blade</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SMIIR0W/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">5-blade</a> and even 7-blade varieties, and the number of blades you choose comes down to personal preference. Some razor users claim that less blades scraping the skin equals less irritation; others say that razors with more blades reduce the number of swipes required for a smooth, irritation-free shave. Cartridge razors are a good choice for women who want a close, baby-smooth shave.</p>
<p>The “foil” in the head of an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01APRR4ME/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">electric foil shaver</a> is a thin, perforated sheet of metal covering the razor itself where hairs enter the shaver and are cut by the oscillating blades underneath. Because only the foil comes in contact with the skin — never the actual blades — electric foil shavers tend to cause less irritation than cartridge razors.</p>
<p>Some electric razors are wet/dry, which means you can either use them on dry skin or wet with shaving cream, which typically gives a closer shave. Electric foil razors are convenient and great for traveling (or anytime you don’t have access to a shower); however, they usually don’t deliver as close of a shave as cartridge razors.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to use trimmers or a razor for your bikini area, when you’re just starting out, it&#8217;s a good idea to trim hair down with scissors to about a quarter of an inch, which prevents your trimmers or razor from getting clogged.</p>
<h2 id="tips">Trimming and shaving tips for sensitive skin</h2>
<p>Our bikini-area skincare expert, Sabrina, recommends dedicating one razor to the bikini area only, rather than using the same tool for bikini, legs and underarms. In her own experience, she has also had better luck using a shaving cream instead of a gel.</p>
<p>“My two go-to shave creams are Coochy Oh So Smooth Shave Cream and Cremo,” says Sabrina. “Apply the cream first thing when you get in the shower, wait to shave last in your routine, apply the cream again and shave. Doing this will help make sure the hair is as soft as possible and the skin is prepped.”</p>
<p>Sabrina also points out that tending to your skin outside of the shower pays off in a big way when grooming the bikini area. “Dry brushing can help beforehand, as well as using witch hazel after to help calm skin. To prevent ingrowns, I use PFB Vanish + Chromabright. If you have extra sensitive skin, make sure to toss or change out your razor blades weekly, and store your razor outside of the shower.”</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Wet vs. dry</h3>
<p>When choosing the best bikini line trimmer for you, it’s important to note that many electric trimmers and razors advertised as “waterproof” are not actually impervious to water. Even if the product box is plastered with terms like “water-resistant,” “shower-ready” and “waterproof,” we recommend reading the manufacturer’s instructions or even contacting customer service before taking your trimmer or shaver into the shower with you.</p>
<p>While some electric trimmers and razors are truly waterproof, be forewarned that the majority are only intended for dry trimming and shaving, sometimes with the option to detach and rinse the head under running water.</p>
<h3>Trimmer skin guards/combs and hair-length settings</h3>
<p>To achieve your desired hair length and keep your tool’s blade from touching skin, bikini trimmers will either feature a built-in skin guard/comb that can be clicked into various hair length settings or include separate, manually attachable combs of different lengths. Some skin guards/combs feature rounded tips for an extra-gentle glide — a bonus for those with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>When selecting your trimmer, consider how closely you want to trim your hair down there. Are you aiming for a super close trim? Happy to keep things neat and tidy, but not super short? Or do you want the option of achieving different lengths, depending on the season?</p>
<h3>Blade type</h3>
<p>The best bikini trimmer for sensitive skin will have hypoallergenic, stainless steel blades and foils, to avoid redness and irritation. Bikini razor blades generally fall into two categories: stainless steel and carbon steel, which should be avoided since it tends to rust. Many razors also feature lubricating strips, which are intended to keep skin moisturized as you shave.</p>
<h3>Size and maneuverability</h3>
<p>The bikini zone is one area where an easily maneuverable razor or trimmer is vital. We recommend using slim, compact, lightweight grooming tools and razors with heads that aren’t too wide (no more than 3 centimeters, including attachments) so you can access hard-to-reach spots.</p>
<h3>Ease of cleaning</h3>
<p>As we noted above, some water-resistant bikini razors and trimmers require you to detach the head to rinse them under water, while others are watertight and can just be rinsed off quickly while still intact. Most come with a cleaning brush to help remove tiny hairs from the head. Razors with moisturizing strips can be tougher to clean, since they often end up with more gunk to remove from the blades.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To test our lineup of eight bikini trimmers and razors, we recruited female testers with especially sensitive skin who had been through the gamut of ingrown hairs, red bumps and general irritation. Our sensitive-skin warriors rated the trimmers and razors on a scale of 1 to 10, using the following metrics.</p>
<h3>Hair-cutting performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>How well does this trimmer/razor groom your bikini area to your liking?</li>
<li>How close of a shave does this razor deliver? Any irritation or nicks?</li>
<li>How well do the skin guards/combs perform?</li>
<li>How effective is this tool’s blade? Do you only need to go over an area once, twice or several times?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Effect on skin</h3>
<ul>
<li>How gentle is the blade on skin? Any irritation, bumps or redness?</li>
<li>What is the effect of this tool’s skin guard/comb on your skin? Any irritation?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Maneuverability and ease of use</h3>
<ul>
<li>How easy is it to grip this tool while shaving?</li>
<li>How would you rate the tool’s size, in terms of ease of use?</li>
<li>Does it reach the areas you want to shave or trim?</li>
<li>How easy is it to clean this tool after use?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Noise level</h3>
<ul>
<li>How would you rate this tool’s noise level? Was it quiet or obnoxiously loud?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Price</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do you think this tool is worth its listed price?</li>
<li>Would you buy this tool yourself, based on its performance and listed price?</li>
</ul>

<p>After mowing our way through eight contenders for the best women’s bikini trimmer, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Norelco GoStyler</a> — a grooming tool marketed specifically toward men — was the standout performer, checking off all of our testing criteria and then some.</p>
<p>Although it was neck and neck with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>, the GoStyler’s winning feature was its capacity to trim all the way down to 1 millimeter — shorter than any lengths offered by the other trimmers. Offering interchangeable 3-millimeter and 5-millimeter combs as well, the GoStyler caters equally to those who want the closest trim possible without shaving, as well as users who prefer a longer, more natural groom.</p>
<p>The GoStyler features stainless steel blades that cut easily and efficiently, requiring only one or two swipes over an area to trim hair to the desired length. Although the GoStyler’s advertising specifically touts its “DualCut” technology (basically, two blades in the head that move speedily from side to side to trim hair), most of the trimmers we tested also featured a two-bladed design.</p>
<p>We experienced zero pulling or irritation during our trimming sessions with the GoStyler, with no nicks to speak of. The buzzing noise produced by this trimmer is not ideal; however, all of the trimmers we tested left something to be desired, decibel-wise.</p>

<p>In a sea of glossy pink, white and lavender women’s trimmers, the GoStyler’s matte black-and-red color scheme is certainly more subdued. Its lightweight, slender body (about 17 centimeters long, with the circumference of an electric toothbrush) fit effortlessly in our hand and was easy to maneuver; the handle’s textured, rubberized surface also provided good grip.</p>
<p>With the comb attached, the end of the GoStyler’s trimmer head was one of two tools we tested that were only 27 millimeters wide (the other was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet</a> model). Whereas some of the other trimmers were much too wide for the bikini area, the head of the GoStyler felt appropriately narrow, giving us the option to do more detailed trimming.</p>
<p>According to the manufacturer, the GoStyler is watertight; however, Philips advises against using it under wet conditions because “wet hairs cannot be lifted by the comb properly.” In any case, the trimmer can be rinsed under water and used in the shower if you choose to risk wetting your hairs.</p>
<p>Though this review is focused on its trimming capabilities, it’s worth noting that the GoStyler also comes with a “detail shaver” head — a floating foil-style electric razor head that could be handy for cleaning up the bikini line (though you won’t get as close a shave as you will with a cartridge razor like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette Mach3</a>).</p>
<p>The trimmer also comes with a cleaning brush and AA battery, and Philips offers a 45-day money-back guarantee and full 2-year warranty. With its sleek shape, efficient blade and superb maneuverability, the GoStyler feels high-end and expensive for its $19.95 price tag.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Though it’s designed for men’s use, the Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler is our top trimmer choice for the women’s bikini area, delivering a smooth, effortless trim that can be adjusted down to 1 millimeter.</li>
<li>With 3- and 5-millimeter hair-length options as well, the GoStyler is a good choice for a variety of trimming preferences.</li>
<li>The GoStyler is truly watertight; it can be used in the shower and rinsed with water.</li>

<p>Our runner-up for best trimmer is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>. In many aspects, the Veet trimmer is like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler</a>’s fraternal twin, delivering the same excellent performance in a glossy pink-and-white package.</p>
<p>Like the GoStyler, the Veet model includes interchangeable combs, though with two length options instead of three: 2 millimeters and 4 millimeters. While the GoStyler features a fully rubberized, textured surface for grip, the Veet model is only partially covered with textured rubber, making it slightly tougher to hang on to. However, it did feel slightly more lightweight in our hand than the GoStyler.</p>
<p>The Veet tool trimmed our bikini area smoothly, requiring only a couple of passes down each “trimming path” to groom the hair to our liking. We didn’t experience any tugging or nicks, and our skin wasn’t irritated or red afterward.</p>
<p>According to the manufacturer, the Veet is a truly wet/dry trimmer. The buzz that emanates from the trimmer is on par with the GoStyler — it’s not obnoxiously loud, but it will make its presence known in your bathroom. In an ironic twist, the femininely designed Veet model’s whine is lower-pitched than the masculine GoStyler.</p>

<p>Like the GoStyler, the Veet feels like a petite, lightweight electric toothbrush in the hand and is easy to hold and maneuver. Its front is coated with rubber for grip, and we wish the back was as well; the shiny white plastic is pretty to look at, but counterintuitive for a non-slip tool. However, the Veet makes up for it with a slightly flatter and wider body, which feels more ergonomic to hold than the GoStyler. With its 27-millimeter head width (with comb attached), this trimmer is narrow enough to maneuver the difficult curves of the bikini area.</p>
<p>Like the GoStyler, the Veet trimmer kit includes an additional head option — a two-sided eyebrow trimmer with 16-millimeter and 6-millimeter hair length options, as well as an attachable eyebrow comb that shortens the length to 2 or 4 millimeters. An AA battery is also included, as well as a cleaning brush. The whole set comes in a clear pink zippered pouch, which is handy for travel. At around $20, the Veet trimmer kit is well-priced for its value, though it doesn’t come with a warranty.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler trimmed smoothly and efficiently, with no pulling and no irritation afterwards.</li>
<li>This tool’s easily maneuverable design features a slightly flatter body that’s particularly comfortable to hold.</li>
<li>Truly waterproof, the Veet trimmer can be used in the shower.</li>

<p>Another men’s grooming tool, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men&#8217;s Razor</a>, is our pick for the best bikini line razor. The Mach 3 has received many endorsements from women for its efficient, gentle, top-notch shave.</p>
<p>The Mach3’s three stainless-steel blades glide effortlessly over the skin of the bikini area, with no roughness or feeling of “catching” on the hairs. After passing the razor over each area once or twice, our skin was literally as smooth as a baby’s bottom. We only nicked ourselves once when, accustomed to shaving with less capable razors, we pressed down too hard mid-swipe. Clearly, the Mach3 requires zero pressure to produce a super-close shave.</p>
<p>Besides that hiccup, we found this men’s razor to be very gentle on the bikini area. Our tester, who has extremely sensitive skin and is prone to red bumps and ingrown hairs, saw no signs of irritation other than three minor bumps the day after she shaved.</p>

<p>In a world of bulky cartridge mega-razors loaded with up to seven blades, the Mach3’s slender, lightweight handle and narrow three-bladed head are ideal for hard-to-reach parts of the bikini area. The rubberized grips on its 14-centimeter chrome handle make it easy to hold on to in the shower, and because its pivoting head measures just 4 centimeters across, we were able to access all the areas we wanted to shave.</p>
<p>Bonus: Since the Mach3 only has three blades, with more space between them than what you’d find in a 5 or 7-blade razor, it rinsed easily after shaving. The Mach3 is priced at around $8 with cartridges running about $2 a pop.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike some bulky bikini razors that were supposedly designed for the difficult-to-navigate pubic area, the Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men&#8217;s Razor has a compact, narrow head and slim body that make it easy to reach tough spots.</li>
<li>The Mach3’s three stainless-steel blades gave us an incredibly close shave.</li>
<li>Our sensitive-skinned testers experienced minimal irritation after shaving with the Mach3.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After testing a lineup of both women’s and men’s trimmers and razors on the bikini zone, we were most impressed with the men’s tools for grooming the area gently yet effectively. The narrow and efficient <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QYOSKFS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips Norelco &#8211; GoStyler</a> gave us a fast and tidy trim, cutting our hair all the way down to 1, 3 or 5 millimeters with no irritation. Simple to hold and maneuver, the GoStyler won us over with its easy to grip, rubberized body and the closest trim of all the tools we tried.</p>
<p>Our second choice, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B079C81WDS/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veet &#8211; Sensitive Precision Beauty Styler</a>, performed as well as the GoStyler, with the option to trim hair down to 2 or 4 millimeters. While its body was only partially covered with rubber, we liked its lightweight feel and ergonomic shape.</p>
<p>Out of the razors we tested, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092K7C1O/?tag=ybdtrim-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gillette &#8211; Mach3 Men&#8217;s Razor</a>, turned out to be the best shaver for the bikini area. With a narrow, pivoting head and three stainless-steel blades, the Mach3 gave us butter-smooth skin and minimal irritation, even for our sensitive-skinned testers.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>For insight into the process other parents have gone through when selecting formula, we talked with three sets of parents from various walks of life to see what formula their babies liked best. We found that most parents can&#8217;t decipher the differences between formulations, much less understand why some work better for their babies.</p>
<p>We boned up on the background of infant nutrition with detailed guidance from <a href="https://babyformulaexpert.com/about-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Bridget Young</a> and <a href="https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/feeding-eating/bottle-feeding/choosing-formula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. William Sears</a>, two experts whose guides are linked all over parenting blogs and discussion groups. We had hoped to get a more concrete set of criteria from the experts, but we found out that even the researchers can&#8217;t point to one specific set of ingredients that will make the perfect formula for everyone.</p>
<p>We researched the manufacturers of formula to see if there was anything notable about specific standards or practices. The US Food and Drug Administration imposes stringent regulations on ingredients, but we did find a few common variations that are discussed below.</p>
<p>Our final selections were based on price, availability, and a comparison of ingredients lists to find a full range of options that can satisfy even the compulsive label-readers among our friends and family.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s in your baby&#8217;s formula is the subject of a government-regulated standard, the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/infant-formula-guidance-documents-regulatory-information/regulations-and-information-manufacture-and-distribution-infant-formula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s Infant Formula Act</a> (&#8220;IFA&#8221;). Just as with most nutritional guidelines, dieticians and researchers have worked to define the minimum and maximum amounts of basic nutrients, vitamins and minerals that go into a product.</p>
<p>The IFA requires manufacturers to register and test any infant formula that&#8217;s brought to market and also regulates quality standards, including a procedure for issuing recalls. All infant formula legally sold in the U.S. meets the IFA standards.</p>
<h3>Water</h3>
<p>OK, this isn&#8217;t a nutrient or ingredient in dry formula, but babies get all of the water they need from the milk or formula you give them.</p>
<p>Tap water from a city supply system is — generally speaking — just as safe as bottled water, but neither is sterile. Parents are advised to boil water before mixing up a bottle of formula to eliminate any risk of bacterial or viral exposure, even when using bottled water. If you have any doubts about lead in your pipes or other low-level sources of contaminants in your water, check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-faucet-water-filter/">faucet water filter</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">water filter pitcher reviews</a> for alternatives to bottled water.</p>
<h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
<p>Sugar, in one form or another, is the main ingredient in milk. The average 100 milliliters of breast milk has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586783/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between 5 and 8 grams of sugar</a>. Lactose is sugar, <a href="https://babyformulaexpert.com/sugar-in-baby-formula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">though it&#8217;s digested differently</a> than the glucose and fructose we harvest from plants.</p>
<p>Most of the popular formula brands use only lactose to add enough calories (about double what you get from cow milk) for growing babies. In a few cases corn syrup is added instead of extra lactose. If your baby can&#8217;t digest lactose, you will need a formula that specifically lists lactose-free ingredients like soy protein instead of &#8220;milk&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Fat</h3>
<p>The next ingredient on the list is fat, at 3.8 grams per average 100 mL of breast milk. Most fat in baby formula is from plant oils: Typically, that includes saturated fats from palm oil and a lighter type like sunflower oil blended in ratios that resemble the fat in breast milk.</p>
<p>Some research suggests that the way palm-oil fats is structured can cause complications in digestion, specifically because palm-oil fats can bind to calcium and make it indigestible. <a href="https://babyformulaexpert.com/baby-formula-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Young says in her formula guide</a> that manufacturers usually make up for that with extra calcium, so fat types are lowest on her priorities. <a href="https://kabritausa.com/blogs/nourish-blog/palm-oil-calcium-soaps-palmitic-acid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kabrita has a neat explainer on palm oil</a> if you want more details, but remember that it&#8217;s an advertisement.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got a pre-term baby who hasn&#8217;t developed full bone density, you&#8217;ll probably want to use a formula like Similac or Kirkland Signature that doesn&#8217;t rely on palm oil.</p>
<h3>Protein</h3>
<p>Protein is the least-significant nutrient in milk by weight, at only 1.3 grams for 100 mL. Protein usually comes from cow-milk whey.</p>
<p>Protein is usually the trickiest nutrient for tiny tummies to digest. If your baby has trouble with constipation, it might be because of the cow-milk proteins in the formula — not the lactose, just the protein. <a href="https://www.drgreene.com/qa-articles/milk-constipation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study found that 65 percent of babies with constipation problems saw an improvement after switching to formula made with soy protein.</a></p>
<h3>Substitutions and easy-to-digest options</h3>
<p>Most experts suggest trying formula with a hydrolyzed protein to make digestion easier. These types of formula are usually labelled with names like &#8220;gentle&#8221; or &#8220;sensitive.&#8221; If pre-digested whey protein doesn&#8217;t make a difference, a soy-protein-based formula is probably in your future.</p>
<p>If different protein doesn&#8217;t help, lactose-free formula is often the next step. Typically this involves using plant sugars that can be digested without the lactase enzyme.</p>
<h3>Supplemental ingredients</h3>
<p>These days, formula packaging calls out non-essential, supplemental ingredients that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3922793/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren&#8217;t covered by FDA regulations</a>. These additives range from specially-derived oils to &#8220;prebiotic&#8221; sugars that encourage the right kinds of bacteria to grow in your baby&#8217;s tummy.</p>
<p>All of these additional ingredients are designed to mimic breast milk, but remember that breast milk varies, and the effectiveness and necessity of each additive is still going through long-term research. Just because a formula manufacturer claims a certain ingredient helps brain growth doesn&#8217;t mean your baby will be deficient without it.</p>
<p>If your baby can easily digest a formula and get the essential calories, fat and protein they need, you&#8217;ve done your job well. Finding a nifty set of extra supplements is icing on that cake.</p>
<p>Many watch-dog agencies like the Cornucopia Institute and blogs like FoodBabe also raise awareness about ingredients like lecithin, the trace amounts of hexane you can find in formula from extracted oils. The FDA says formula is safe if it&#8217;s made according to industry standards, but there&#8217;s plenty of room for the concerned parent to ask if some formula could be even more safe.</p>
[table id=306 /]
<h3>Organic and GMO-free certifications</h3>
<p>Food certification is important to many consumers, but it&#8217;s also big business. Remember that even if you pay double or triple for a tub of premium formula, it&#8217;s still meeting the same nutritional standards as all the other formula on the shelf and usually comes from the same factory.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) guidelines for organic certification are strict and definitive, so certified organic formulas with the USDA seal are sourced from organic farms in a traceable supply chain.</p>
<p>Our researcher for this post has worked with a family farm to get organic certification in California and can testify to the level of detail required by inspectors and auditors. That said, there&#8217;s usually no discernable difference in the resulting food, and the heavily processed ingredients in formula aren&#8217;t covered in pesticides or fertilizers the way something like lettuce can be.</p>
<p>If trace amounts of stuff that&#8217;s not allowed in the USDA organic certification program — that list ranges from antibiotics that may be fed to cows, herbicide sprayed on seeds or solvents used to extract oil from soybeans — bother you, most brands have a second label and a higher price tag for nearly-identical formula made from milk and oils that should have had less exposure to those things.</p>
<p>The potential exposure to non-certified ingredients isn&#8217;t entirely avoided by buying certified organic baby formula, though: The <a href="https://www.cornucopia.org/2013/12/find-safest-organic-infant-formula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cornucopia Institute filed an official complaint in 2008 </a>because formula manufacturers were allowed to add specialized ingredients (DHA and ARA oils which contribute to eye development) to certified organic formula, even though these ingredients had been extracted with hexane solvents.</p>
<p>The USDA and FDA haven&#8217;t enforced a ruling by the National Organics Standards Board that the extracted ingredients should disqualify formula from organic certification. So, as consumers, we&#8217;re left to shrug our shoulders about the implications or do our own research and find a product that&#8217;s made differently.</p>
<p>Thus far <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007GH8R4Q/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baby&#8217;s Only</a> is the only manufacturer using an alternative oil extracted from eggs with water, but their formula is not tested for feeding infants and is sold as a toddler formula. Some formulas are available without DHA and ARA, but most pediatricians recommend that it be included.</p>
<p>Genetically modified organisms (&#8220;GMOs&#8221;) are an even trickier subject. Right now <a href="http://gmoanswers.com/current-gmo-crops" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are only ten GMO crops</a>, so most plant ingredients in baby formula couldn&#8217;t come from GMO varieties anyhow. The impact of GMO-free sourcing is biggest in soy-based formula, since most soybeans grown in the U.S. come from the biotech seed labs. But between sugar from corn and sugar beets and oils from canola and soybeans, there are opportunities for ingredients from modified-genome plants to pop up.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that formula ingredients are at their most basic molecular structure and don&#8217;t contain DNA. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/01/21/378882909/why-some-gmo-foods-don-t-have-genetically-modified-dna" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When NPR investigated GMO-free labelling standards</a>, they found that most common GMO-derived ingredients wouldn&#8217;t even be detectable if we screened carefully for them.</p>
<p>When the <a href="https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2018/12/20/Final-GMO-labeling-rule-does-not-require-labeling-of-highly-refined-ingredients-from-GM-crops-if-no-modified-genetic-material-is-detectable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final U.S. regulations for mandatory GMO labelling</a> come into play in 2020, processed products like baby formula will not have to disclose if they use sugar, oil or protein from GMO plants. Voluntary &#8220;GMO-free&#8221; labels are still going to be common, but they don&#8217;t mean any more for baby formula than they do for water in most cases.</p>

<p>The FDA doesn&#8217;t publish a list of approved formula, though they do have specific rules about registration and what has to be in formula. <a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/fhs/wic/documents/List_of_Infant_Formula_Manufacturers_Wholesalers_and_Distributors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to this list maintained by the state of New Jersey,</a> there are only four major FDA-registered manufacturers of formula in the U.S.: Abbot (Similac), Mead Johnson (Enfamil), Nestle (Gerber) and Perrigo (nearly every other brand).</p>
<p><b>Abbot Nutrition Brands</b> makes Similac formula, which has been around since 1923. We strongly suspect that Abbot also makes the Kirkland Signature formula for Costco, since it&#8217;s so similar in every possible way. Note the identical packaging in the above photo, but also the absence of palm oil in the ingredient lists. Naturally, neither company will verify where Costco buys their product, and it is possible they could switch suppliers without warning.</p>
<p><b>Mead Johnson Nutrition</b> has been around since 1903, and their Enfamil formula was launched in 1964. This is another key player in the brand-name formula race.</p>
<p><b>Nestle </b>is one of the oldest and best-known formula manufacturers, though you won&#8217;t see the name on a bottle of formula in the U.S. Nestle acquired the <b>Gerber</b> baby food company in 2007, and they merged the two lines for sales in the U.S., while using the Nestle name in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Pharmacist Henri Nestle designed a breast milk replacement in 1867, and his work on condensing milk built a multinational food company that has changed the way we buy chocolate, milk and even water.</p>
<p>Nestle was so aggressive in their worldwide marketing of formula in the 1970s that <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/nestle-baby-formula-boycott/melissa-sartore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some called them baby killers</a>, after mothers without the means to safely prepare formula were effectively tricked into decreasing their own breast milk supplies when they used free formula samples handed out by saleswomen dressed as nurses.</p>
<p>The distinctive feature of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N8RTWZR/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gerber &#8211; Good Start</a> formula is that it&#8217;s only available with added probiotics and broken-down, easier-to-digest protein, comparable to a &#8220;sensitive&#8221; or &#8220;gentle&#8221; formula from other brands.</p>
<p><b>Perrigo</b> makes basically every other formula sold in the United States. They have an in-house brand, but you&#8217;ll have an easier time buying their products from other major retailers. Perrigo even runs a website called &#8220;<a href="https://www.storebrandformula.com/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storebrandformula.com</a>&#8221; to ease concerns about buying &#8220;cheap&#8221; alternatives to brand-name &#8220;premium&#8221; formula.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to spot Perrigo formula by the packaging once you know what to look for, and they&#8217;re now making formula for everyone from Amazon to Whole Foods to Target. Even the premium-priced Organic formula from Happy Baby, Earth&#8217;s Best Organic and Honest Company almost certainly came out of a Perrigo facility.</p>
<p>One other manufacturer, <a href="https://www.prolacta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Prolacta</b></a>, makes formula out of donated breast milk to help pre-term infants. It&#8217;s not commonly available and is classified separately by the FDA.</p>
<p>There are other major manufacturers of formula worldwide, but they have yet to register for sales in the U.S. under the conditions required by the FDA.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Parent-s-Choice-HMO-Non-GMO-Advantage-Infant-Formula-with-Iron-4-Pack-35-oz-ea/780084641" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parent&#8217;s Choice &#8211; Infant Formula</a> is the store-brand formula available at Walmart, and it&#8217;s the formula you should probably try first.</p>
<p>Since infant formula is so strictly regulated in terms of nutrition, and since different babies will respond in different ways to formula, we stuck with price and availability as our key selection criteria for a top pick. You can get this formula shipped or pick it up in-store, and it&#8217;s almost always the least expensive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember when comparison shopping that Perrigo makes almost every store-brand formula on the market and quite a few custom-label organic formula brands.</p>
<p>Now, we can&#8217;t say for certain that there will never be a difference between what Perrigo puts in a particular brand&#8217;s tub. For example, Honest Company specifically gets Perrigo to leave out the algae-derived DHA/RDA supplement that&#8217;s been the subject of minor controversy.</p>
<p>But the most significant differences are always going to be in protein types and sugar types offered for special dietary needs. Brands don&#8217;t matter much in picking one of these, since they all follow the same rules and offer the same lines of alternative blends to help you find something your baby can digest well.</p>
<p>Walmart sells the same six basic formula types that all the other full-line retailers do: a Similac clone, an Enfamil clone, a clone of the easy-digestion recipes from those brands, an organic formula and a dairy-free formula. They&#8217;re all certified and tested to be good formula.</p>

This is top-notch formula at a very competitive price.</p><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Parent-s-Choice-HMO-Non-GMO-Advantage-Infant-Formula-with-Iron-4-Pack-35-oz-ea/780084641" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Walmart.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The one distinction between Parent&#8217;s Choice formula and the competition that gave us pause is that the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Parent-s-Choice-Organic-Infant-Formula-With-Iron-23-2-oz/35849584" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">organic version of the formula</a> uses corn syrup solids and maltodextrin, rather than lactose, for its sugar calories. Many parents are leery of corn syrup, but that one ingredient is probably behind the price difference between this and other organic brands.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re willing to pay a little bit more to avoid retailers like Walmart and Target, our runner-up pick from Kirkland Signature is also a very good formula. But they only sell one type of formula, while Parent&#8217;s Choice has an entire lineup of options.</p>
<p><b>Recall update:</b> <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/perrigo-issues-voluntary-recall-parents-choice-advantage-infant-formula-milk-based-powder-iron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I</a>n the summer of 2019, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/perrigo-issues-voluntary-recall-parents-choice-advantage-infant-formula-milk-based-powder-iron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perrigo recalled 23,388 tubs</a> of Parent&#8217;s Choice &#8211; Advantage after metal was found in one specific batch. That&#8217;s worth noting, but it&#8217;s far less serious than, for example, the e. coli contamination outbreaks in lettuce that were announced in late 2018. Other manufacturers have issued formula recalls before, because mistakes happen in manufacturing and the recall system catches them. Premium brands are no less likely to be recalled, there have actually been <a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/infant-formula-recalls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more recalls for top-dollar formula</a> than store brands. We want buyers to be informed about recalls, but we haven&#8217;t changed our opinions about the quality of Parent&#8217;s Choice.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Parent&#8217;s Choice &#8211; Infant Formula is easy to find and the most affordable.</li>
<li>If your baby has a special dietary need, you can probably find a suitable formula from Parent&#8217;s Choice.</li>
<li>This formula is made in a certified facility that follows the same regulations as everyone else.</li>
<li>Most other store-brand formula is likely to be identical to the Parent&#8217;s Choice equivalent.</li>
<li>Walmart will typically ship formula to your door just as quickly as anyone else.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;ve tried another formula and your baby isn&#8217;t responding well, or if you&#8217;ve got a baby who needs extra calcium, <a href="https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Non-GMO*-Infant-Formula-34-oz%2C-3-count.product.100292648.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirkland Signature &#8211; Infant Formula</a> is a palm-oil-free blend that might be a better choice than the other store brands, for only slightly more per ounce.</p>
<p>Costco Wholesale&#8217;s Kirkland Signature line is probably the most prestigious store brand you can find, generally supplying top-shelf products at a substantial discount. When we found the Kirkland baby formula on the shelf one bay over from the Similac formula, we could hardly believe how similar they were. From the ingredients to the packaging, it&#8217;s certain that Costco&#8217;s store brand formula is made by Abbot, the company that makes Similac.</p>
<p>Kirkland formula has a very slightly different formulation from the full-price Similac &#8211; Pro Advance that it&#8217;s based on, but note that they&#8217;ve changed the serving size listed in the nutritional information to make it difficult to compare the two containers.</p>

If you're looking to avoid calcium-absorbing palm oil, this is the most affordable brand that doesn't use it.</p><a href="https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Non-GMO*-Infant-Formula-34-oz%2C-3-count.product.100292648.html" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Costco.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>As with most formula, Kirkland Signature advertises specialized fat and sugar ingredients claimed to mimic breast milk more closely than the basic lactose and protein from processed cow milk.</p>
<p>The big difference on this ingredient list is one that&#8217;s starting to draw attention: Like Similac, Kirkland Signature formula doesn&#8217;t use palm oil to match the high ratio of palmitic-type fats found in breast milk, but uses coconut oil instead.</p>
<p>Palm oil is linked to reduced calcium absorption, so using it means other manufacturers have to add some extra calcium just to make up the difference. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5475287/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palm oil is also associated with harder poop</a>, so if you&#8217;re dealing with a constipated baby, Kirkland Signature is worth investigating.</p>
<p>What Costco doesn&#8217;t give is a full line of formula types. If you&#8217;re looking for formula with processed proteins for easier digestion, or if your baby is allergic to cow-milk proteins and you need dairy-free formula, you&#8217;ll need to buy another brand.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s also the cost of a Costco membership to consider—but over just one year, you&#8217;d save nearly $800 buying Kirkland signature formula instead of Similac. That difference covers a membership easily.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Kirkland Signature &#8211; Infant Formula is a premium product at a great price.</li>
<li>This formula doesn&#8217;t use palm oil, which is an ingredient many parents are choosing to avoid.</li>
<li>Another brand with similar ingredients is Similac, which sells for nearly double the price.</li>
<li>Kirkland only sells standard baby formula, no options for sensitive babies.</li>

<p>Among the organic formulas we tried, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WLH9LQF/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Happy Baby &#8211; Organic Infant Formula</a> is corn-syrup free and slightly higher in gut-bacteria-nurturing prebiotics. The price isn&#8217;t the best, but it&#8217;s fairly easy to find in stores like Whole Foods.</p>
<p>Every single indication points to Perrigo as a manufacturer for Happy Baby formula, just like the store brands. From the taste of the formula to the special storage clip for the plastic scoop, Happy Baby formula is at least a sibling of other Perrigo-made organic brands.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WLH9LQF/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/happybaby-thumb-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/happybaby-thumb-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/happybaby-thumb-180x180@2x.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/happybaby-thumb-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/happybaby-thumb-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/happybaby-thumb-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/happybaby-thumb-180x180.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/happybaby-thumb-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/happybaby-thumb.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Organic Pick: Happy Baby</h3><p>This is almost definitely from the same factory that makes Walmart's formula, but they've chosen to spend a bit more on organic lactose instead of using plant-based sugars. Happy Baby also adds more prebiotics than most other formula blends, which might help digestion.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WLH9LQF/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Compared to Parent&#8217;s Choice &#8211; Organic Infant Formula, which costs 17 cents more per ounce than the regular stuff, Happy Baby will set you back about a dollar more per ounce. They&#8217;re subject to the same restrictions on where they can get ingredients and what can go into formula either way, but Happy Baby chose not to use corn syrup as a source for sugar, just organic lactose.</p>
<p>Organic formula is still a heavily processed product, so only trace amounts of synthetic pesticide or fertilizer could possibly show up in the final product. We don&#8217;t think organic formula is a good value, but if you&#8217;re committed to buying organic this is a good option.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Happy Baby &#8211; Organic Infant Formula is like other Perrigo formula, but with certified organic ingredients.</li>
<li>Slightly more prebiotic ingredients than other organic brands might help digestion.</li>
<li>No corn syrup, just lactose for the calories your baby needs.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s also a low-lactose and older-baby version of this formula available.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, everything we&#8217;ve said about Parent&#8217;s Choice formula above is also true of <a href="https://www.target.com/p/advantage-hmo-infant-formula-35oz-compare-to-similac-pro-advance-up-up-153/-/A-70000043" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Up &amp; Up &#8211; Infant Formula from Target</a>. The descriptions of the prebiotic ingredients are slightly different, but equivalent.</p>
<p>The biggest difference we saw between Walmart and Target is that Walmart offers formula in packages of four tubs. Buying in bulk will save you 13 cents per ounce, which adds up to about $200 per year. Target runs promotions once in a while that bring the price in line with Walmart, but you&#8217;d have to wait and stock up when the time is right.</p>
<h3>Similac</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24354" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac.jpg" alt="Similac" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-180x120@2x.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Similac-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to turn your nose up at store-brand formula and only consider the big-name baby formula brands despite all the regulated similarities, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Similac-Pro-Advance-Non-GMO-Formula-Support/dp/B01KQ9DNV2/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Similac &#8211; Pro-Advance</a> is the brand that makes the most sense to us. They don&#8217;t use palm oil, which means better calcium absorption and possibly softer poop for your baby.</p>
<p>Similac &#8211; Advantage is so similar to the blend of ingredients used in Kirkland Signature that we find it hard to think of a reason to pay extra for the name brand. We tried the Similac &#8211; Pro-Advance, and it is very slightly different in texture and flavor because of an added prebiotic sugar called &#8220;Human Milk Oligosaccharide&#8221; or &#8220;HMO.&#8221; This is a sugar that isn&#8217;t digested; instead, it stays in your baby&#8217;s gut and feeds the beneficial bacteria that help digest food.</p>
<p>In our testing, we found that this formula was the first to smell slightly fishy and possibly rancid after we stored a few samples separately from the bigger containers for a few weeks. Definitely keep this stuff in a cool, dry place.</p>
<p>The price of Similac is just about double that of Parent&#8217;s Choice or Kirkland Signature, at $1.18 per ounce. Similac does sell a certified organic version of their formula, while Enfamil does not.</p>
<h3>Enfamil</h3>

<p>The other big-name player in the baby-formula world is Enfamil with their line of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077M4Q27K/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neuro-Pro formula</a>. Our test family has received Enfamil formula samples every time they had a new baby, so they must be working closely with obstetricians or hospitals to get access to new parents.</p>
<p>Enfamil&#8217;s primary distinction is a new type of fat they call &#8220;milk fat globule membrane&#8221; (&#8220;MGFM&#8221;). This fatty compound is supposed to make formula based on cow milk a little bit closer to human milk, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27234413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they&#8217;ve shown in some research</a> that it might promote brain development better than regular formula. They got in trouble with advertising watchdogs for suggesting so boldly that Enfamil is better at growing brains, but it is a unique additive.</p>
<p>Enfamil&#8217;s NeuroPro blend is the most expensive formula we tested, at about $1.29 per ounce or $2,000 for a year&#8217;s supply.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AHZ5JOY/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Earth&#8217;s Best &#8211; Organic Infant Formula</a> is one of the oldest and best-known certified organic formula brands, and it&#8217;s only gotten better with time.</p>
<p>This certified organic baby formula used to be the least-expensive on the market. Since Parent&#8217;s Choice started offering a lower-lactose organic formula for a much lower price, and Happy Baby is offering a blend with more prebiotics for only 4 cents more per ounce, it&#8217;s hard to pick this as an overall winner.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/b01ltho2kq/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Earth&#8217;s Best does sell a DHA-free version of this formula</a>, but the price bump is insane: You pay an extra ten dollars per tin just to have a tiny amount of oil (and a few parts per billion of potential solvent exposure) left out. Most pediatricians strongly recommend you buy a formula with DHA, and supplement drops are a pain to deal with.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MJ4ZC62/?tag=ybdform-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kabrita &#8211; Toddler Formula</a> is the only formula on our list that hasn&#8217;t been tested and approved for feeding infants by the FDA, so it can&#8217;t legally be sold as an infant formula. Hence the name &#8220;Toddler Formula.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kabrita has become a trendy option for infant formula all the same, and it&#8217;s the most-recommended goat-milk option. Here are a few points of interest for goat milk formula:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goat milk might not cause as much discomfort as cow milk if your baby is sensitive to casein proteins that are present in cow milk only. If you&#8217;re allergic to cow milk, though, you could also be allergic to goat milk.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/feeding-eating/feeding-infants-toddlers/goat-milk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Sears recommends goat milk for some patients</a> because it has smaller, easier-to-digest fat globules than cow milk.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://babyformulaexpert.com/best-goat-milk-formula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr Young says in her post on goat milk that Kabrita adds more whey protein</a> to make this formula closer to breast milk than most other European-import goat-milk formula blends on the market. The palm oil they use is also a special type that doesn&#8217;t reduce calcium availability.</p>
<p>Kabrita does include hexane-extracted DHA oils, which some parents would rather skip. Note that it&#8217;s not a certified organic product, either, so the soy oil in this formula was also probably extracted with the same solvents that make DHA controversial.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in buying a goat-milk-based formula, this is the one available to U.S. consumers. Other brands are sold for U.K. and European parents, but the legality and cost of importing formula make it hard to recommend when there are so many other options.</p>

<p>Formula is a product designed to provide all the nutrition that a baby needs to grow in the first year of life, so it&#8217;s important that you&#8217;re buying good formula.</p>
<p>The FDA tests and monitors the quality of infant formula closely, and if a product isn&#8217;t shown to help babies thrive it&#8217;s not allowed to be sold as baby formula. There&#8217;s no reason to doubt the safety or quality of baby formula sold in the United States.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve picked the most affordable formula as the best infant formula overall: At just 50 cents per ounce, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Parent-s-Choice-HMO-Non-GMO-Advantage-Infant-Formula-with-Iron-4-Pack-35-oz-ea/780084641" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parent&#8217;s Choice infant formula</a> is a bargain. When you pick a product that you&#8217;re going to feed six times a day for a year, it&#8217;s nice to know that you&#8217;re not paying more than you need to.</p>
<p>If your baby is experiencing discomfort from indigestion or hard stools, there&#8217;s a full range of specialty alternative formula available from Parent&#8217;s Choice.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble finding a formula that works for your baby, talk to your pediatrician about what to try next. But we hope we&#8217;ve helped you understand at least some of the factors that separate one brand of formula from the rest.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We consulted with registered yoga instructor, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hollenbeckyoga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Hollenbeck</a>, about her recommendations for choosing a yoga mat. She also helped test mats and was indispensable in guiding us with this review.</p>
<div class="ybd-expert"><div class="ybd-expert-outer"><img class="  ybd-expert-headshot" data-src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sarah-hollenbeck-expert.png" /><div class="ybd-expert-inner"><h4 class="ybd-expert-title">Expert Consulted:</h4><h5 class="ybd-expert-person">Sarah Hollenbeck</h5><p class="ybd-expert-person-title">Certified Yoga Instructor</p></div></div></div>
<p>We also scoured yoga subreddits and surveyed various yoga devotees to find out what features they look for and value in a yoga mat. We then consulted trusted review sites to pinpoint the current top-rated mats. We narrowed our list down even further by reading through customer reviews on Amazon to weed out the mats that didn’t live up to the hype and further define the features everyday yogis value in a yoga mat. With all of this information under our belts, we could define the key metrics to use for our mat selection and comparison.</p>
<p>We then chose mats to test from our list that best matched the most vital, sought-after features we’d discovered in our research, had a high number of customer reviews and were rated above four stars on Amazon. For the best affordable yoga mat category, we chose mats under $40; for the best travel yoga mat, we selected thin, lightweight, highly portable models to test.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>“In general, it&#8217;s best to look for mats that compliment your practice and lifestyle, as that&#8217;s what will keep you coming back to yoga again and again,” Sarah notes. “For instance, if you are new to yoga and have sensitive joints, it’s best to go with a mat with greater cushion, as it will provide relief for your joints. If you have been practicing for some time, you may want to consider something with a bit more longevity. Body types should be taken into account as well, as someone taller will need a bigger mat to keep proper alignment in poses without trailing off the edge.”</p>

<p>In general, there are three yoga mat thickness levels to consider:</p>
<h4>Thin (2 millimeters and below)</h4>
<p>For classes that are more difficult or specifically focused on balance, like Bikram or Iyengar, thinner mats are the way to go. If you plan to use your mat while traveling, a thin, lightweight and/or foldable mat is a sensible option to fit in your suitcase or carry-on. Advanced yogis or those who practice on a soft surface (like carpet) may also prefer a thinner mat.</p>
<h4>Medium (generally in the 3 millimeter range)</h4>
<p>Medium thickness mats are often good for hatha and vinyasa yoga, which require a balance of cushion and grip.</p>
<h4>Thick (about 5 millimeters and up)</h4>
<p>If you have sensitive joints or plan to practice a type of yoga that requires you to hold poses for an extended period of time — yin or restorative, for example — a thicker mat will provide the padding you need to cushion your joints and the balls of your hands and feet, so you can hold those long poses with less pain. This is also a great option if you plan to practice on a solid surface, such as hardwood, tile or cement floors.</p>
<p>Props and other tools are also available as an alternative to buying a thicker mat, including yoga blankets, blocks, bolsters and straps to alleviate pressure on joints. Special yoga knee pads, gloves and socks can also be used for additional cushioning on a thinner mat.</p>
<p>“Props can be used on an as-needed basis if you are still experiencing pain in your joints,” advises our mat expert, Sarah. “Over time, as your body gets used to practicing on a regular basis, you can upgrade to thinner mats, which provide more balance.”</p>
<p>While thicker mats provide maximum comfort and cushioning, keep in mind that too much cushion tends to be tougher to balance on. A thick mat that isn’t high quality can also be lacking in the “bounce-back” factor, leaving you with permanent dents and impressions on your mat after a session.</p>
<p>Of course, your selection will ultimately come down to personal preference. Do you like a harder or softer surface? Do you prefer the cushioned feeling of a thick mat, or do you want a solid surface that will deliver optimum balance and stability? If you’re just starting out, we recommend beginning with a low-priced mat on the thicker side (such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B078XJ1D5W/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HeathYoga &#8211; Eco Friendly Non Slip</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IAAIEIG/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Clever Yoga &#8211; Better Grip</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GQLH61H/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gaiam &#8211; Print Premium</a>) until you get a better idea of your thickness preference.</p>

<p>Another important factor to consider when buying a yoga mat is how much traction you need on the top of your mat. There are two types of traction you’ll find on a mat’s surface: “grippiness” and “stickiness.” A grippy mat surface is textured to provide extra grip for your hands and feet, while a sticky mat surface is actually tacky to the touch and provides even more protection against slippage.</p>
<p>A non-skid bottom is an especially important feature to have in a yoga mat, especially if your practice involves a lot of movement, like vinyasa or ashtanga. If you practice any type of hot yoga, or if you tend to perspire a lot, you’ll want a mat with plenty of traction all around — grippiness, stickiness <i>and</i> a non-skid bottom. Yogis who fall into this category may also want to consider anti-bacterial mats for their practice. Some mats are actually designed to become even grippier with moisture; these are ideal for hot yoga.</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>There are many different materials to choose from, and they all have their pros and cons, depending on the type of yoga you plan to practice.</p>
<p>“For those who don&#8217;t like to upgrade their mats every few years, a plain yoga mat made out of rubber is the best bet,” says Sarah. “Many brands are also coming up with manufacturing processes that reduce carbon emissions during creation, which can help make your practice more eco-friendly.”</p>
<p>Here are the most common materials you’ll find.</p>
<h4>PVC</h4>
<p>Pros: PVC is one of the most common materials used in yoga mats. (Those yoga mats for rent in your gym? Those are probably PVC mats.) Generally very durable, PVC usually features optimum cushioning for restorative poses and a nicely sticky surface. With lots of budget-friendly options to choose from, PVC mats can be a great choice for beginner yogis.</p>
<p>Cons: PVC can become slippery when wet, so we don’t recommend it for Bikram and hot yoga enthusiasts. Also known as polyvinyl chloride (basically, vinyl), PVC is man-made and not eco-friendly.</p>
<p>(A note about PVC: There is speculation that too much exposure to PVC can actually be bad for your health. Not only is it non-biodegradable, it actually releases dioxin — a chemical that causes cancer — into the air when incinerated. To make PVC pliable for use in products, it must be treated with phthalates, which have had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/phthalates_factsheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative effects on reproduction</a> when tested on lab animals.)</p>
<h4>NBR</h4>
<p>Pros: Nitrile butadiene rubber (aka NBR) is a non-toxic, budget-friendly option that tends to be very padded and comfortable. Because it’s oil-resistant, it’s also easy to clean.</p>
<p>Cons: While the cushiness of NBR certainly feels nice, it does mean less stability for standing poses. NBR also tends to stretch during poses like warrior or down dog, affecting stability even more.</p>
<h4>TPE</h4>
<p>Pros: Though thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) is a manmade rubber, it’s actually biodegradable. Inherently antimicrobial, it’s easy to clean and also UV-resistant, making it great for outdoor use. It also offers good traction.</p>
<p>Cons: TPE is not as durable as PVC and does not feel as cushioned as PVC either.</p>
<h4>Natural rubber</h4>
<p>Pros: Like TPE, natural rubber is biodegradable, anti-microbial and very grippy.</p>
<p>Cons: If you’re allergic to latex, you’ll want to avoid natural-rubber yoga mats like the plague. Natural-rubber mats can also be heavy to carry, have a noticeable odor and tend to run in a higher price range.</p>
<h4>Polyurethane</h4>
<p>Pros: Very grippy and durable, polyurethane (PU) mats are a good option for yogis on a budget.</p>
<p>Cons: Unfortunately, PU yoga mats aren’t eco-friendly.</p>
<h4>Cork</h4>
<p>Pros: Cork is a great environmentally friendly “alternative” material that offers long-lasting durability and terrific grip that actually <i>increases</i> when wet, making it a good option for Bikram and hot-yoga practitioners.</p>
<p>Cons: If you’re looking for an eco-friendly mat made purely out of cork, watch out for those that have a rubber backing (many of them do). Cork itself can feel very dense and hard on the joints, and cork mats tend to run in a higher price range.</p>
<h4>Jute</h4>
<p>Pros: Jute is another natural, environmentally friendly “alternative” option. It has a rough texture that provides great traction either on its own or when placed over a regular yoga mat. Lightweight and anti-microbial, jute mats tend to be cheaper than other eco-friendly mat materials.</p>
<p>Cons: Jute can be a bit rough on the skin and takes some getting used to. It’s also quite thin and doesn’t provide much padding for the joints.</p>
<h4>Organic Cotton</h4>
<p>Pros: Last but not least, organic cotton mats are another eco-friendly alternative that can be used alone or on top of your regular yoga mat. Because they absorb sweat well and grow more “grippy” with moisture, cotton mats are great for hot yoga and Bikram. They’re also lightweight and easy to clean — simply throw yours in the washer after class.</p>
<p>Cons: Organic cotton mats provide barely any padding and can be slippery when dry.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Yoga mats range in length from the standard 68 inches to the extra long 85 inches. As far as width goes, mats vary from a narrow 23 inches to a broad 36 inches. Body type and height are obviously factors when choosing the size of your mat; when lying flat on the mat, your entire body should fit on its surface. If you’re an advanced yogi or especially flexible, you may prefer to have extra room to move around on your mat as well. It’s also a good idea to consider how much space you have available to practice in, and then choose your mat accordingly.</p>
<h3>Convenience</h3>
<p>Convenience should also be a factor when choosing your yoga mat. Consider whether you need a mat that’s lightweight (for example, if you commute to your class via public transportation or are going to travel frequently with your mat in tow). Does the mat fit easily in your bag? Is it compact enough to store easily? Is it easy to keep clean or a hassle to disinfect after each session? “Those who practice mainly at home can invest in something thicker and larger,” says our yoga expert, Sarah, “but yogis on the go should look for a mat that&#8217;s lightweight and easy to travel with.”</p>
<h2 id="types-of-yoga">Types of yoga (and matching mats)</h2>
<h3>Hatha</h3>
<p>In the West, hatha yoga has generally come to mean a slow-paced, gentle form of yoga that’s perfect for beginners. Because it’s unlikely that you’ll work up a sweat, we recommend starting with a basic low-priced, non-slip mat, and then upgrading to a more specific type of mat once you get a feel for your needs or branch out into a particularly yoga specialty.</p>
<h3>Vinyasa</h3>
<p>Vinyasa is a form of yoga characterized by its flow of continuous, dance-like movement and focus on the breath as the yogi transitions smoothly from asana to asana. Vinyasa’s quick movements and continuous sequences require a dense, sticky mat on the thicker side with a non-skid bottom.</p>
<h3>Bikram and hot yoga</h3>

<p>Although both are practiced in 95°F to 105°F heat, Bikram and hot yoga are actually not the same type of yoga — while hot yoga is a broader term that refers to any form of yoga practiced in a heated room, Bikram is a set of 26 postures followed in an exact sequence with two specific types of breathing exercises. For both types, you’ll want to invest in a mat with lots of grip and stickiness in the midst of sweat and moisture, such as jute or cork (which actually increase their grip when wet), or use in a non-skid yoga towel placed over your regular mat. We recommend an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insulated water bottle</a> for icy rehydration during a hot set.</p>
<h3>Ashtanga</h3>
<p>Linked to vinyasa yoga, ashtanga is a disciplined and rigorous practice that follows a series of challenging poses with no breaks in between. Since ashtanga will have you dripping sweat right off the bat, we recommend either a cork mat or a dense, sticky mat with grippy undersides, along with a yoga towel for extra slip support.</p>
<h3>Iyengar</h3>
<p>Iyengar yoga is all about achieving improving posture and achieving perfect alignment, usually involving blocks, straps and other props to help facilitate the poses, which can be held for a full minute or even longer. Alignment mats with good grip and stickiness in the midst of sweat are ideal for this type of yoga.</p>
<h3>Yin and restorative</h3>
<p>Restorative yoga is focused on deep relaxation of the body and mind, while yin stimulates specific meridians in the body and improves circulation around the joints with poses that are held for up to 10 minutes at a time. Because both yin and restorative yoga are slow-moving, meditative practices that involve holding poses for long periods of time, yogis will need mats with plenty of cushioning for maximum comfort and relaxation.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>The mats in our lineup were put to the test over several weeks by seven yogis of varying body types and heights, ranging in skill from beginner to advanced and in age from early 20s to 40-plus. Our testers used the mats during regular one-hour hatha, vinyasa, restorative, Bikram and hot-yoga sessions. Following testing, we asked our yogis to rate the mats on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the best) using the following metrics.</p>
<h3>Traction</h3>
<ul>
<li>How “sticky” is the mat’s surface? How “grippy” is the mat’s surface?</li>
<li>How well does the mat maintain its stickiness and grippiness in the midst of sweat and moisture?</li>
<li>How effective is the mat’s non-skid bottom?</li>
<li>How well does the mat maintain its integrity during use (as opposed to stretching during poses)?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thickness</h3>
<ul>
<li>How comfortable is it to perform seated poses on the mat?</li>
<li>How stable/balanced do we feel on the mat?</li>
<li>Does the material bounce back after use, or are you left with dents and divots?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li>How does the mat’s material feel against our skin?</li>
<li>Does the mat have an odor once out of the packaging? If so, does it fade at all with cleaning?</li>
<li>How easy is the mat to clean after use?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Size</h3>
<ul>
<li>How cramped or spacious does the mat feel?</li>
<li>How portable is the mat? Is it easy/hard to carry, roll up, store, etc.?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design and color</h3>
<ul>
<li>How pleasing to the eye is the mat?</li>
<li>How well does the mat’s color match what was advertised?</li>
<li>How would we rate the variety of designs and/or prints available for this mat?</li>
<li>If the mat has alignment markings printed on it, how helpful did we find those markings to be?</li>
<li>Does the mat have lasting marks or sweat stains on it after each session?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Price</h3>
<ul>
<li>After using the mat, would we say the mat is well worth its price?</li>
</ul>

<p>The most budget-friendly yoga mat options are the rentable community mats at your gym or yoga studio. However, assuming you would prefer to forego an encounter with the bacteria and fungus left behind by other yogis and buy your own brand-new mat, we highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B078XJ1D5W/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HeathYoga &#8211; Eco Friendly Non Slip Yoga Mat</a> as our top pick for the best affordable yoga mat.</p>
<p>The HeathYoga mat is dual-layered, with a textured, non-slip top surface and a “tire tread” bottom for traction. Although we were skeptical at first that the “tire tread” was just for show, we were soon converted; the mat didn’t budge throughout our yoga sessions. As for the textured top, while it doesn’t offer much stickiness, it does provide excellent grip for the hands and feet (though the grip does decrease slightly when you start to sweat).</p>
<p>Our testers also reported that the mat’s diamond-pattern texture is an unexpectedly pleasurable tactile bonus — a “mini massage for your hands and feet,” according to one yogi. Made of environmentally friendly, anti-microbial TPE in a simple, tasteful design, the mat feels luxurious and expensive for its sub-$30 price tag.</p>

<p>The mat’s 6-millimeter thickness is springy enough to provide nice cushioning for the joints and balls of the hands and feet, without compromising balance and stability. Our hatha and restorative yoga testers reported excellent comfort levels for seated and resting positions. Because the mat’s bottom traction is so strong, it maintains its integrity during use and doesn’t stretch out, and any dents that appear on the top of the mat quickly disappear again minutes later.</p>
<p>At 72 inches by 26 inches — four inches longer and two inches wider than the average yoga mat — our taller yogis appreciated the HeathYoga mat’s larger surface area. Weighing in at 2.2 pounds, the mat is lightweight to carry, though slightly on the bulky side. It does come with a velcro strap and carrying strap, which helps with the load. The mat comes in five no-fuss color variations: turquoise, pink, purple, green and gray.</p>
<p>This mat receives bonus points for its alignment markings, which are meant to help yogis maintain proper alignment during their practice. Although our testers admitted that they didn’t always pay attention to these marks during their sessions, the lines did serve as helpful reminders of where to place their hands and feet, especially during vinyasa flows. Because the markings are stamped into the mat’s surface for a recessed effect, it is easy to achieve correct alignment without looking down too much; for example, if you’re in child’s pose or downward dog, you can feel around with your fingers to find the recessed line marking where your hands should be placed.</p>
<p>With its great traction, forgiving cushioning and low price point, the HeathYoga &#8211; Eco Friendly Non Slip Yoga Mat is the perfect eco-friendly starter mat for beginners. Its superior grippy, yet not <i>too</i> sticky surface also makes it an excellent option for vinyasa-flow practitioners, and hatha, yin and restorative yogis will appreciate its cushy thickness. We also recommend it for those who practice Iyengar yoga and put particular focus on alignment.</p>

<p>Travel yoga mats are usually designed to be extremely thin for maximum portability; however, this often comes at the cost of comfort and joint support. Unless you’re an advanced yogi, travel mats tend to be quite taxing on the joints and balls of the feet and hands, especially in supine, seated and kneeling positions. At 3 millimeters thick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AOHUHQ/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jade &#8211; Travel Yoga Mat</a> offers about 1 millimeter more cushioning than most travel mats. Our testers gave it high marks for both balance and cushioning, noting that it is surprisingly comfortable for a travel mat.</p>
<p>Weighing in at just over 3 pounds, the Jade mat is admittedly on the heavier side for a travel mat. However, its outstanding performance with regard to our other criteria — comfort, traction, material, etc. — clearly outweighs the competition. This mat is streamlined enough for travel, but it’s not so thin that you’ll be suffering and wincing your way through downward dog and cat-cow. “It’s the perfect amount of barrier between the floor and my body,” says one of our testers. “It’s a great buy.”</p>
<p>Made of biodegradable natural rubber, the eco-friendly Jade Travel Yoga Mat features a subtle surface texture and open-cell construction, which gives it a nice grip and excellent stickiness, even in the presence of sweat. Although one tester noted that the mat could use a bit more traction on its bottom surface, the mat maintained its integrity throughout the yoga sessions with zero stretching.</p>

<p>The antimicrobial Jade mat had a slight rubbery odor at first, but the smell faded after the first cleaning. Because of its relatively smooth surface, the mat is easy to clean, with any smudging disappearing after a wipe-down. The mat’s simple, rather plain design comes in four colors: purple, green, blue and black.</p>
<p>This mat’s cushy comfort does have one negative trade-off: it is not as easily foldable as other travel mats often are. The mat may be rolled tightly or folded lengthwise, but due to its thickness, folding it into a square may lead to creasing. If you plan to pack this mat in a suitcase, we recommend checking to make sure your travel case is the same width or wider than the mat’s breadth.</p>
<p>Surprisingly comfortable for a travel mat, the Jade &#8211; Travel Yoga Mat will make you actually <i>want</i> to practice yoga while you’re on the road. With great surface and bottom traction, it’s an excellent choice for yogis on the go, or advanced practitioners who desire a thin, easily portable mat. (Note: Advanced yogis who don’t require cushioning and are looking for a super lightweight, extra-thin travel mat may want to check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KP49Z8S/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jade &#8211; Voyager Mat</a>, which is about 1.6 millimeters thick and weighs a measly 1.5 pounds.)</p>

<p>Seasoned hot yogis know that toting your equipment to a Bikram or hot yoga class can feel like a workout in itself; along with your water bottle and regular yoga mat, there’s the full-size towel to place over your mat to reduce slippage once you start sweating, as well as a smaller towel to wipe yourself down after class. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ZBGY1C/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aurorae &#8211; Synergy 2 in 1 Yoga Mat</a> helps lighten the load with a unique double-sided design that features a full-length microfiber towel already built into its surface. Bonded to a PER (polymer environmental resin) base, the built-in towel eliminates the hassle of a separate towel bunching up on top of your mat. “I like both the convenience and aesthetics of having the microfiber attached,” says one tester. “It makes the mat super sleek.”</p>
<p>Although our natural rubber and PVC contenders provided good surface grip at the beginning of our hot yoga and Bikram classes, the Aurorae mat climbed quickly to the head of the pack once our testers started sweating. “The more you sweat, the better its stability and balance,” one tester says. “I tend to slip on rubber material. For someone who sweats a lot, this mat was perfect.” The Aurorae mat also provides excellent bottom traction, staying intact and refusing to budge or stretch even when things start to get sweaty.</p>
<p>The Aurorae &#8211; Synergy 2 in 1 mat is so responsive to moisture that its manufacturers recommend misting the top of the mat with water before you even begin to sweat for increased grip. Our testers agree, noting that the microfiber material provides less traction when dry, and is even a little slippery before you start to sweat. So while this mat is the perfect companion for a hot yoga or Bikram experience, it may not be the ideal choice for less sweaty types of yoga.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ZBGY1C/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yadeyoga-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yadeyoga-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yadeyoga-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yadeyoga-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yadeyoga-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yadeyoga-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yadeyoga-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yadeyoga-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yadeyoga-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for hot yoga: Aurorae - Synergy 2 in 1</h3><p>A built-in microfiber towel gives this machine-washable mat unbeatable traction when wet, with zero bunching during Bikram and hot yoga sessions.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ZBGY1C/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The 5-millimeter Aurorae mat gets high marks for comfort; it feels great against the skin and leaves zero dents or impressions on the microfiber side after classes. And with a 72-inch by 24-inch surface area, it feels nice and spacious during your practice as well.</p>
<p>Because hot yoga and Bikram environments are breeding grounds for bacteria, it’s vital to clean your mat after every session to keep things hygienic. Conveniently, the Aurorae &#8211; Synergy 2 in 1 mat can be thrown right into the washer after every class (it’s compatible with front-loading machines or top-loading washers without agitators) and then simply air-dried before your next sweat session. If you have a top-loading washer with an agitator, the manufacturer recommends washing the mat with a coarse sponge instead.</p>
<p>The Aurorae &#8211; Synergy 2 in 1 Yoga Mat is a dream for hot yoga and Bikram practitioners, eliminating the need for a separate yoga towel and delivering excellent surface traction when wet. It’s also a great option for arduous ashtanga classes and for yogis who tend to sweat easily. We highly recommend misting the top of the mat at the start of your class for optimum surface grip.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>

<p>Our runner-up in the best affordable yoga mat category is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IAAIEIG/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Clever Yoga &#8211; Better Grip Yoga Mat</a> which, with its 6-millimeter thickness, gets high marks for both comfort and balance.</p>
<p>“The mat was cushioned, but still firm enough to feel stable in standing balance poses,” says our tester, who notes that it is especially good for yin, Iyengar or restorative yoga.</p>
<p>The Clever Yoga mat maintains its shape well and doesn’t stretch out during standing poses — qualities that can be hard to find in a thicker mat. Its bottom traction is also excellent with surface grippiness and stickiness ratings slightly higher than average.</p>
<p>Thought it was a close race between the Clever Yoga mat and our top pick for best affordable yoga mat, the HeathYoga mat ultimately won out for its handy alignment system and for having slightly better surface traction.</p>

<p>Also in the best affordable yoga mat category is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GQLH61H/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gaiam &#8211; Print Premium Yoga Mat</a>, which has a good overall design and fares well in our bottom and top surface traction ratings. “This is a solid mat,” says one tester.</p>
<p>The mat loses points for being a bit stiff and difficult to roll up. At 5 millimeters thick and 68 inches long, the mat is also thinner and shorter than its competitors in the category, though it does come in a variety of lively patterns.</p>
<h3>Manduka &#8211; Prolite Yoga and Pilates Mat</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23932" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite.jpg" alt="Manduka - Prolite mat" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/manduka-prolite-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Our runner-up in the best yoga mat for hot yoga category, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073ZJ3LR3/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Manduka &#8211; Prolite Yoga and Pilates Mat</a>, gets high marks from our testers for its overall comfort and the stability they felt while using the mat (though one yogi notes that it felt a little thin to her). The 4.7-millimeter mat provides good cushioning, with a pleasant surface texture that helps prevent slippage. It’s easy to clean and leaves no permanent smudges, and its 71-inch and 79-inch length options are great for tall yogis.</p>
<p>During hot yoga, however, the mat loses much of its surface grip once you begin to sweat; our hands began to slide forward during down dog. A towel would be required to use this mat for Bikram or hot yoga.</p>
<p>The Manduka Prolite is an excellent all-around yoga mat — but we don’t recommend it for Bikram or hot yoga.</p>
<h3>Jade &#8211; Harmony Mat</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23931" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony.jpg" alt="Jade - Harmony mat" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jade-harmony-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Another contender in the best yoga mat for hot yoga category, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EC7KW0/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jade &#8211; Harmony Mat</a> is very similar in quality to the Manduka Prolite, providing excellent stability, balance and bottom traction. Made from eco-friendly natural rubber, the mat is easy to clean, leaving no stains or smudges behind. One tester notes how sturdy and high-quality the mat felt during her session.</p>
<p>Like the Manduka Prolite, the 4.7-millimeter Jade Harmony had great initial surface traction — until we began to sweat in our hot yoga sesh. In the face of moisture, the Jade mat loses much of its surface grippiness and stickiness, causing our hands to slip forward during down dog.</p>
<p>Just like the Manduka Prolite, we recommend the Jade Harmony for regular, non-sweaty yoga practices.</p>

<p>As much as we wanted to like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NR62BI/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Manduka &#8211; eKo Superlight Travel Yoga Mat</a>, it had several downsides that left us disappointed and a little sore. The 1.5-millimeter mat barely provided enough cushion to differentiate it from the floor underneath; we were counting down the seconds until we could shift our weight off of our knees, hands and sit bones and into the next pose. Even for a travel mat, it was quite uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The mat’s surface grippiness was okay, with its stickiness faring a bit better. However, once our hands became slightly sweaty, we started slipping forward like crazy in downward dog. The combination of discomfort and a slippery surface made for an overall unpleasant yoga experience.</p>
<p>The mat does offer excellent bottom traction and doesn’t stretch at all during poses. It also folds up easily for portability, and its minimal surface texture makes it easy to clean.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Your choice of yoga mat is determined by a range of factors — the type of yoga you do, the environment you practice in, your skill level, body type, past injuries, etc. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B078XJ1D5W/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HeathYoga &#8211; Eco Friendly Non Slip Yoga Mat</a> is an excellent affordable option for any yogi to start with, featuring a handy alignment system, excellent traction, 6 millimeters of cushy thickness and a luxurious feel that defies its price point.</p>
<p>For those looking to take their yoga mat on the road, we recommend the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AOHUHQ/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Jade &#8211; Travel Yoga Mat</a> for its combination of portability and comfort. Made of eco-friendly natural rubber, the mat offers impressive stickiness and grip that endure through sweat and moisture.</p>
<p>The unique, double-sided <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ZBGY1C/?tag=ybdyogmat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aurorae &#8211; Synergy 2 in 1 Yoga Mat</a> is our pick for hot yogis. The mat’s built-in microfiber towel provides unbeatable surface traction when wet with its truly non-skid base. Bikram and hot yogis will love that it’s machine-washable — a major plus for keeping sweaty mats bacteria and fungus-free.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We talked to experts and gave 11 digital thermometers to a test family. The iProven won top marks overall, with Motorola's instant-read model best for checking babies.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter our test family used 11 of the best digital thermometers for tracking body temperature, they chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ML4B1BC/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iProven &#8211; DMT-511</a> as the best thermometer overall. With easy-to-read temporal (forehead) and tympanic (ear drum) modes, you can confidently tell the difference between low-grade fever symptoms and a high fever. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola &#8211; MBP70SN Smart Touchless Thermometer</a> is even better for quickly checking baby and toddler temperatures when your little one just won&#8217;t sit still. It&#8217;s a good idea to have a traditional probe thermometer on hand, too, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079V7C135/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ADC &#8211; Adtemp 418N</a> is both easy to use and reliable.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>During nine hours of careful research, we read recommendations from health agencies, reviewers like Consumer Reports, Wirecutter and Baby Gear Lab, parenting magazines and blogs.</p>
<p>Our researcher spoke with nurses at his children&#8217;s pediatrician&#8217;s office (part of the St Joseph Medical Group in Orange) as a part of the research for this review. He also interviewed Naomi Jackson, a mother of four and a registered nurse working at Killam General Hospital, about her own experiences and preferences. We checked all of these front-line perspectives against the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).</p>
<p>After we collected a list of favorite types and model numbers, we checked our list against retailer listings. We checked Amazon to see which models are best-selling and have the highest average review score, but we also looked for updated versions of the best sellers.</p>
<p>In addition to popular consumer retail websites, we looked at medical-supply catalogs to see where professionals are getting their gear. We didn&#8217;t buy any clinic-grade thermometers that cost over $300, but we noted the prominent manufacturers and found some good examples of home-use thermometers based on technology developed for the clinic.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Fever indicator guides:</b> Most new thermometers use symbols or colors to tell you if a body temperature is within normal range. If the temperature is a low grade or high fever, colored lights or other indicators will notify you. If you don&#8217;t have time to look up temperatures on a chart, then these color-coded fever warnings might be helpful. It&#8217;s still a great idea to check and write down the body temperature of your family members (and yourself) on a day when you&#8217;re not sick, so you&#8217;ll have a better idea of how severe a fever is. Find out what range the thermometer considers normal and severe, and remember that the temperature ranges are different for a baby.</p>
<p><b>Predictive vs. live monitor readings:</b> All the thermometers we bought are &#8220;guessing&#8221; at a body temperature reading. For example, probe thermometers don&#8217;t actually wait for the metal tip to reach a stable temperature, they guess based on known temperature curves in typical scenarios.</p>
<p>It sounds tricky, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11340736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&#8217;s been proven accurate and is much quicker</a> than waiting for a thermometer to come up to your actual temperature. If you want to monitor changes in real time, you&#8217;ll need to make sure you buy a monitoring thermometer and learn how to use it.</p>
<p><b>Actual vs. compensated reading:</b> Like predicted temperatures for probes, most forehead thermometers are adjusting their temperature reading by a few degrees to tell you what a person’s oral reading should be. Again, this is fairly accurate, but you should understand what the number actually means.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of buying a thermometer is deciding which type will serve you best. There are pros and cons for each type, and they will all let you down if you don&#8217;t learn how to use them consistently.</p>
<p>After testing a wide range of types we feel comfortable with both scanning and instant forehead thermometers as the easiest to use.</p>
<p>If you want something that&#8217;s more bulletproof, probe thermometers basically never give a false reading, though you still need to know where to put them to get a consistent temperature.</p>
<h3>Probe thermometer</h3>
<p>A digital version of the mercury-in-glass thermometers used a century ago, these thermometers are still incredibly popular. For adults, a probe thermometer under the tongue is an easy way to get a reliable temperature.</p>
<p>For infants and children younger than 3, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) <a href="https://www.aappublications.org/content/30/11/29.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommends taking a rectal temperature if you want the most accurate reading</a>, though one nurse we spoke with said she would never ask a parent to take a rectal temperature.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Probe thermometers can give very reliable readings.</li>
<li>This type is the least expensive.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re also easy to carry in a diaper bag.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two words say it all: rectal probe.</li>
<li>Oral readings are tricky with squirming kids or babies.</li>
<li>Oral temperatures are not considered reliable in babies before six months of age.</li>
<li>Axillary (armpit) temperatures aren&#8217;t as consistent as other methods.</li>
<li>Having multiple thermometers, or at least disposable covers, is essential if you&#8217;re sharing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pacifier thermometer</h3>
<p>This is just a probe thermometer built into a pacifier, so you&#8217;ll at least have a fighting chance of getting an infant to keep it in his or her mouth.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pacifier can be much easier to get your baby to accept than a regular thermometer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accurate readings through a pacifier nipple require up to five minutes of sucking to verify temperature.</li>
<li>Professionals don&#8217;t recommended oral temperature for checking newborns.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>We looked at the pacifier thermometers available and were disappointed by long read times and tiny displays.</b> Pacifier models are also missing extra features we&#8217;ve come to expect from other thermometers. Reviews were quite negative, so we didn&#8217;t test any.</p>
<h3>Ear (tympanic) thermometer</h3>
<p>Reading the eardrum with an infrared sensor is quick, but you have to get a clear shot at it. Studies have shown that newborns often have ear canals that are too small to allow this type of thermometer to work effectively, so it&#8217;s only recommended after six months. Even then, the nurses we talked to still find this type frustrating on occasion.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Readings for kids and adults can be very accurate.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re quicker than oral measurements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earwax can lead to inaccurate readings.</li>
<li>Readings for infants younger than six months are not considered reliable.</li>
<li>Some people hate having things in their ears.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scan-type forehead (temporal) thermometer</h3>
<p>This type of thermometer uses either an infrared sensor or a metal contact patch with a thermal probe behind it to measure the temperature of your forehead, specifically the blood flowing through the temporal artery on your temples. This involves scanning over a fairly wide area to get an average temperature, usually for just a few seconds with infrared scanners.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is fast and non-invasive.</li>
<li>Studies show this is usually a reliable way to judge body temperature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s hard to know when you&#8217;re using a forehead thermometer wrong.</li>
<li>Scanning the forehead still takes 2-3 seconds.</li>
<li>Babies may not hold still enough for this to work well.</li>
<li>These models require skin contact.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-contact forehead thermometer</h3>
<p>Like the above forehead thermometers, this type measures skin temperature to estimate the temperature of blood inside your temporal artery. The distinction is that this new style measures over a wider area instantaneously, so it doesn&#8217;t have to touch your skin.</p>
<p>This type of thermometer is so quick, you might doubt its accuracy. That said, it&#8217;s fast enough to be very easy to use. It&#8217;s also the thermometer least likely to wake someone. It&#8217;s also important to make sure the forehead is clean and dry before using this type.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hands down, this is the fastest way to take a temperature.</li>
<li>No skin contact is required to take a reading.</li>
<li>You can take readings without waking someone up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This type is the most expensive.</li>
<li>You still need to practice measuring the same spot each time.</li>
<li>These thermometers have the most buyer complaints about inconsistent readings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-fever">Understanding fever temperatures</h2>
[table id=285 /]
<p>Generally speaking, physicians consider temperatures above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit to indicate a fever. That means the body&#8217;s metabolic system has raised its temperature to respond to illness. 100.4 is 2.2 degrees higher than the average temperature of 98.2.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a guideline for clinical practice, but the range of normal temperatures in different people is wide. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-normal-body-temperature#temperature-range" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The range in adults goes from about 97 to 99</a>, so if your normal body temperature is on the low end, an equivalent to the standard fever reading would be just 99.4.</p>
<p>Babies tend to be slightly warmer, and after age 65, our bodies stay cooler on average. In those age ranges, doctors advise paying extra attention to a fever and any other symptoms.</p>
<p>if you&#8217;re going to buy and use a thermometer, you owe it to yourself to find out what your (or your child&#8217;s) normal temperature range is. Most of the manuals we read recommended to check at the same time of day over a few days.</p>
<p>Once you learn how your thermometer works and what your normal temperature is, you&#8217;ll be better prepared to take accurate readings when you&#8217;re sick.</p>
<h3>What to do about a low-grade fever</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re not seeing any problematic symptoms, most doctors will prescribe rest and possibly pain-relieving drugs. <a href="https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/AAP-Issues-Advice-on-Managing-Fevers-in-Children.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a report in 2011</a> that makes a very clear statement about fever and fever-reducing drugs:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fever is a physiological mechanism that has beneficial effects in fighting infection. Although many parents administer antipyretics (medications to reduce a fever) such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to a child to reduce a fever, the report emphasizes that the primary goal should be to help the child feel more comfortable, rather than to maintain a “normal” temperature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents should focus on the general well-being of the child, his/her activity, observing the child for signs of serious illness and maintaining appropriate fluid intake.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Parents should not wake up a sleeping child to administer a fever-reducer. Antipyretics must be stored safely to avoid accidental ingestion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Parents should be aware that the correct dosage is based on the child’s weight, and that an accurate measuring device should always be used.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nurse-interview">A nurse&#8217;s perspective</h2>
<p>We talked to Naomi, a mother of four who works as a Registered Nurse in the emergency room at a small hospital in rural Alberta, Canada. We asked her to compare what she uses at work and at home.</p>
<p>Naomi&#8217;s hospital uses a clinic-certified model from Exergen, fairly similar to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004T6G550/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TAT200c</a> we tested. The nurses rely on a probe thermometer if they have doubts: &#8220;If we&#8217;re not sure of accuracy and the child is symptomatic we just go to the axilla (armpit) after [a forehead scan].&#8221;</p>
<p>For home use with her four kids, Naomi bought an ear-reading infrared thermometer, but she says it&#8217;s not as reliable as some would have you think: &#8220;Even the hospital grade in-ear thermometers are way off sometimes. User variations—getting it in exactly the right place in the ear, pulling the lobe just right to position the canal, etc&#8230; that make it less accurate. If I was to get a second thermometer for home I would get a temporal [forehead-type].&#8221;</p>
<p>We asked Naomi how they check temperatures in the ER for infants, given all the studies that suggest a rectal thermometer is the only one that’s really accurate. &#8220;Rectal is considered the most accurate of any measurement,&#8221; she says, &#8220;but also has the most risk of harm. Nurses are not allowed to take rectal readings without a doctor&#8217;s order, and it is hardly ever necessary to have a reading that accurate. I would never recommend rectal to a parent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, we asked her what kind of device would give the most helpful information to a parent when talking with a nurse, and she laughed. &#8220;If I call in to Health Link [a telephone medical advice service in her area] the nurses always make me retake the temperature with a probe thermometer under the arm before they will give advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, whatever thermometer you pick, read the instruction manual carefully, and learn how to take consistent readings. Also, don&#8217;t be surprised if a nurse tells you to use a cheap probe thermometer under your baby&#8217;s arm.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our test family consists of two adults, a three-year-old, and an eight-month-old. They&#8217;ve used a variety of thermometers over the last three years, including a non-contact forehead thermometer and a few cheap probe thermometers.</p>
<p>Our testers used most of the thermometers a few times for checking cold symptoms, but mostly they took normal readings and relied on controlled tests to see how the thermometers responded to elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>Normal temperatures among our testers ranged from 97 degrees Fahrenheit to 98.5.</p>
<p>Note that our tests show, as expected, all of these thermometers are calibrated from the factory to give valid readings. You&#8217;ll need to learn how to interpret those readings for a thermometer to be useful.</p>
<p>For example, the red fever indicator light on some thermometers shows up at 99.5, while on others that temperature would trigger an &#8220;elevated&#8221; indicator with a &#8220;high&#8221; fever light reserved for 102.6.</p>
<p>Different test sites (forehead, ear and mouth) also show different temperatures, and some thermometers even convert a &#8220;raw&#8221; reading into an equivalent for what you would likely see with a different thermometer.</p>
<p>So if you want to know if a fever is serious, it&#8217;s important to know how much higher your temperature is, compared to a thermometer reading when you&#8217;re definitely healthy.</p>
[table id=284 /]
<h3>Ease of use and read time</h3>
<p>Each thermometer type works a little bit differently, so we measured the time between turning the thermometer on and a final temperature reading.</p>
<p>The real winner is, again, the instant-scan <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075QQ8VZW/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iHealth</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TVS12U4/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun</a>. The read time really is instant, and that can make all the difference if you&#8217;ve got a fussy baby. For taking temperatures on yourself or an older kid, it&#8217;s not as much of an issue, but the speed is still nice.</p>
<p>An uncooperative baby or toddler presents two problems when you&#8217;re taking a temperature. First, they don&#8217;t sit still. Second, they often don&#8217;t want you to touch them with the thermometer.</p>
<p>Non-contact thermometers are the real winners in this test as well, since they give readings instantly and don&#8217;t need to touch your kid&#8217;s skin. If you have a two-year-old throwing a tantrum that might not be enough, but at least you&#8217;ve got a fighting chance.</p>
<p>The other thing to note about testing with babies is that you need to be more aware of exactly what counts as a fever. See our section on <a href="/#understanding-fever">understanding fever temperatures.</a></p>
<h3>Accuracy: water bath</h3>
<p>Many purchasers who leave low-score reviews complain about the difficulty of getting consistent readings with forehead thermometers, and the same is sometimes true of ear thermometers. Basically, the more reviews a thermometer has, the more likely someone has complained about it.</p>
<p>The fact that many thermometers aren&#8217;t giving you a &#8220;true&#8221; reading doesn&#8217;t help: Braun <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/technology/2015/01/10/more-thoughts-on-the-braun-no-touch-forehead-thermometer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quickly points out when asked</a> that their readings are factoring the temperature from your whole forehead and predicting your body temperature, rather than just giving you a simple reading.</p>
<p>For our first accuracy test, we used a warm water bath and a large cast iron pan to get a stable temperature. Our reference was a calibrated alcohol-filled thermometer with traceable certification to half a degree Celsius. Agitating the water constantly to keep the temperature stable, we checked the temperature of the water for probe thermometers or the iron surface for infrared-reading models.</p>
<p>In our chart, we recorded averages of high and low readings. All of the probe thermometers were very accurate, but three readings from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GT7Y8GY/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vicks &#8211; Rapid Read</a> varied the least averaged to just over a tenth of a degree from the calibrated reference across three tests.</p>
<p>If tallying up the error margin (or &#8220;delta&#8221;) on each reading, then averaging the amount of error per reading, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0795ZW85G/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kinsa &#8211; QuickCare</a> squeaks ahead by a few decimal points.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, probe thermometers are carefully calibrated from the factory and are probably more accurate than our bath setup is capable of testing.</p>
<p>Many of the infrared thermometers would not accept the metal surface or the surface of the water to give a reading. Two models would test in &#8220;object&#8221; mode (advertised as a way to check bath and bottle temperatures) but were more than four degrees off.</p>
<h3>Accuracy: body temperature</h3>
<p>We checked accuracy with all of the forehead and ear thermometers against a rectal temperature reading. The most accurate body temperature readings came from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004T6G550/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Exergen &#8211; TAT200c SmartGlow</a>, but that&#8217;s partly because the directions for that thermometer suggest averaging forehead measurement with a reading behind the ear.</p>
<p>The only device that was more than one degree off was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TVS12U4/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; NTF300US</a>, but it gives a reading that&#8217;s one degree cooler than every other thermometer. That&#8217;s closer to an armpit measurement, rather than an oral measurement equivalent we expected.</p>
<p>Again, numerical accuracy isn&#8217;t a problem if you&#8217;ve taken the time to find out what your normal body temperature reads as with the thermometer you buy, since all the models we tested are all very consistent. But it could be confusing if you were worried about a fever, bought the thermometer, saw a &#8220;low grade fever&#8221; 100.4 reading and then checked it again with a different method and saw 103.4.</p>
<h3>Consistency</h3>
<p>As expected, all the thermometers were very consistent. We tested multiple readings with the same subjects, being careful to check as consistently as we could with each model. We used one infant and two adult subjects for repeat tests to nail down consistency.</p>
<p>Most thermometers came in at 0.2 or 0.3 degrees change over three readings. The highest variability came from contact-reading thermometers, but two thermometers achieved a totally steady reading over three closely-spaced readings with multiple subjects: The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola Baby</a> instant-read and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GT7Y8GY/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vicks</a> probe thermometers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ML4B1BC/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iProven &#8211; DMT-511</a> is a new update to a best-selling thermometer design. As the only combination forehead-and-ear thermometer on our list, it&#8217;s also more versatile. If you want the ability to back up a forehead scan with a different type of measurement in case you get a strange result, iProven has you covered.</p>
<p>A perennial best-seller, iProven has clinched recommendations from the likes of Wirecutter, Babylist and The Bump with their old DMT-489 model. The 511 is slightly sleeker and easier to use: older models had separate buttons for forehead and ear readings and relied on combination presses for other functions.</p>
<p>The new design uses the cap to detect which mode you&#8217;re using, and just one &#8220;take temperature&#8221; button. There&#8217;s a designated function button for mute and memory options. You still need button combinations to change scales and switch to object measurement mode, but it&#8217;s a better interface than the old models.</p>
<p>In use, the iProven is accurate and easy to use. In forehead mode (with the cap on) you need to hold down the read button and swipe the reader across your forehead.</p>
<p>The swipe-scanning motion does take longer than an instant-scan touchless thermometer like our runner-up. If you&#8217;re dealing with a baby that&#8217;s thrashing, even the two-second swipe might be frustrating. The iProven is still a good thermometer for babies, but this is mostly the best digital thermometer for adults or kids.</p>
<p>Measuring the temperature of the eardrum is also easy: Pop off the cap, insert the tip carefully into the ear canal while pulling back on the earlobe, and press the button for an instant reading.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re averse to objects going into your ears you might skip that mode, but it works as well as the forehead scan. In our tests, the eardrum temperature was on average 0.2 degrees cooler than the forehead, which indicates the thermometer is compensating to give similar readings with both methods.</p>
<p>Some people will already be looking up a chart to interpret between different types of thermometers, but you can rely on this thermometer to give you a number consistent with what you&#8217;d get from skin temperature under the armpit.</p>

It's not the fastest thermometer, but the bonus of a back-up ear scan method is good for peace of mind if you get a strange reading. A bargain price and all the options you could ask for rounds out its feature list.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ML4B1BC/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Memory for the last 35 readings is available at the push of a button. That&#8217;s a handy feature if you&#8217;re tracking a fever as it runs its course, though it doesn&#8217;t give you an at-a-glance overview as an app or even a paper notebook would. It&#8217;s a less-useful feature if you use the thermometer for more than one person, since you&#8217;d quickly lose track of which readings belonged to each person.</p>
<p>This model also includes a mode to scan baby bottles and bath water—hold down the function button when the thermometer is powered off to activate this mode—though somehow it was off by eight degrees. Don&#8217;t buy this thermometer for kitchen or laboratory use; instead, check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">meat thermometer</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/thermoworks-thermapen/">Thermapen reviews</a> for devices with that kind of accuracy.</p>
<p>Happily, iProven includes a mode to adjust the built-in temperature compensation by up to two degrees, which means you can fine-tune the reading to better match a reference reading using a different kind of thermometer.</p>
<p>Changing between Fahrenheit and Celsius is handled with a toggle switch inside the battery compartment, which is definitely our favorite method. To mute the confirmation beep that sounds with every reading, hold down the mode button with the &#8220;memory/mute&#8221; symbol.</p>
<p>After comparing the field, we were won over by the simple controls, reliable reading and low price of this model. The eardrum mode is a nice perk; most of us shouldn&#8217;t need it, but if your patient&#8217;s forehead is covered in sweat or dirt it&#8217;s nice to have a back-up method.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The forehead scan mode of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ML4B1BC/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iProven &#8211; DMT-511</a> gives quick, accurate measurements, so long as you use it consistently.</li>
<li>If you ever doubt a forehead reading, the eardrum mode is a handy backup method.</li>
<li>Silent mode is also easy to activate.</li>
<li>No Bluetooth or profiles means less frustration.</li>
<li>35 past-temperature memory, but no profiles for individual family members.</li>
<li>Not as quick or simple as an instant-read model.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a thermometer to add to your baby registry, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola &#8211; MBP70SN Smart Touchless Forehead Thermometer</a> has a few advantages over the iProven.</p>
<p>First, the Motorola scans from up to two inches away from the center of the forehead, no touching necessary. Second, the Motorola gives a measurement instantly, and there&#8217;s no need to practice side-to-side scanning. It’s much easier to get readings from a fussy baby or a toddler this way.</p>
<p>Beyond those clear benefits, the Motorola is a mixed bag. You give up the ear scan feature that makes the iProven more flexible, though remember that ear scans aren&#8217;t considered accurate until six months anyhow.</p>
<p>Motorola doesn&#8217;t include a silent mode for this thermometer either. If you&#8217;re checking someone who&#8217;s sleeping, the &#8220;didi&#8221; beep is not excessively loud, but it&#8217;s there. There&#8217;s no guarantee it won&#8217;t wake a light sleeper.</p>
<p>For taking the temperature of a wriggly baby, an instant scan is as good as it gets, but sometimes even that isn&#8217;t fast enough to make your job easy. </p>

<h3>Not just for babies</h3>
<p>A non-contact thermometer is easier for everyone to use, not just for parents of newborns. If you&#8217;ve got a mirror, the point-and-click method is even easy to use on yourself. If you&#8217;re used to taking a temperature with an oral thermometer, you might consider the touchless design a waste of money, but it&#8217;s definitely convenient.</p>
<h3>Are apps and profiles worth it?</h3>
<p>Motorola gives you profiles to track temperatures for four users, which means more button-press combinations to remember if you want to get the most out of this model.</p>
<p>A Bluetooth connection links your thermometer readings with the &#8220;Hubble Connect for Smart Nursery&#8221; app. It&#8217;s a decent way to see a trend line, manage profiles and set medication reminders but not much else.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re also using another Motorola Baby nursery device, like a baby monitor or humidifier, you can use the same app rather than install something new for each device. It&#8217;s still an app that we don&#8217;t think is necessary. Our test for a data-collection app is whether it lets you do something more easily than a paper notebook would, and in this case a notebook in the medicine cabinet (or just making entries on your phone&#8217;s calendar app) works better.</p>
<p>Sharing temperatures by email didn&#8217;t actually work when we tested that feature with Gmail on an Android phone.</p>
<p>Switching profiles on the thermometer takes a few seconds, so we wouldn&#8217;t blame you for just taking readings without switching every time. If you&#8217;ve got four babies and you really want an accurate historical record, the app is required to move temperature readings between profiles. You can&#8217;t see profile names on the thermometer, either, just numbers.</p>
<p>Most parents aren&#8217;t going to need this kind of record, but it does make the memory feature useful with more than one person.</p>

<p>The Motorola was slightly more accurate and more consistent for us than the iProven &#8211; DMT-51. It&#8217;s fast and very easy to use, as long as you&#8217;re not stuck trying to remember which person in your household is assigned each profile slot.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, if you&#8217;re OK with ignoring the extra features, or if you actually want to track temperature readings on a graph, this is a great thermometer. The basic measurement function works right away without your pressing any menu buttons.</p>
<p>If you’re not  worried about waking a sleeping baby, the non-contact design isn&#8217;t worth the doubled price. In addition, Motorola uses a method that’s less well-proven to determine body temperature from your forehead, and in certain cases, there could be factors that lead to problems with accuracy.</p>
<p>If you want measurements you can feel 100-percent confident about, we&#8217;d still advise that you have a backup conventional probe thermometer like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079V7C135/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the ADC</a>. If you&#8217;re talking to a doctor&#8217;s office on the phone, they&#8217;ll likely ask for that type of reading, even if you have detailed charts that track your temperature hour by hour.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to quick readings, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola &#8211; MBP70SN Smart Touchless Thermometer</a> is nearly impossible to beat.</li>
<li>This thermometer was very accurate and consistent in our tests with all ages.</li>
<li>The extra features and app only give you better access to stored measurements, they don&#8217;t make this a better thermometer.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re skeptical of instantaneous no-contact readings, you&#8217;ll want to have a backup thermometer on hand as well.</li>

<p>If you want an easy-to-read and fairly speedy thermometer that just does what you&#8217;d expect, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079V7C135/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ADC &#8211; Adtemp 418N</a> is an easy recommendation.</p>
<p>A probe thermometer is only as accurate as your technique, though. If you don&#8217;t learn how to put it in the right place under your tongue or armpit, you might get an inconsistent reading. Rectal readings are generally very consistent, but there&#8217;s some risk of injury if you&#8217;re not careful.</p>
<p>Probe thermometers are carefully calibrated, as our tests in a water bath against a certified lab thermometer confirmed. The most variation we saw between readings from any of this style of thermometer was 0.38 degrees, and our top pick averaged to 0.31. Our ability to maintain the conditions of the test was almost certainly worse than the thermometer itself.</p>
<p>What sets the ADC probe thermometer apart from the competition is simplicity. The only option you have to worry about with this thermometer is switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. (While the thermometer is off, press and hold the power button until the scale symbols start flashing; press the power button to switch, then wait for it to power off.)</p>
<p>ADC upgrades this model over older models with a fever warning via a colored backlight. That&#8217;s a nice perk, but the bigger selling point for us is the quick read time and easy-to-see numerals.</p>
<p>After you press the power button, you&#8217;ve got about 10 seconds before a reading is confirmed. That&#8217;s not as fast as the lightning-quick Vicks &#8211; Rapid Read system, but with the ADC you don’t need to confirm which site you&#8217;re using every time you turn it on. For an oral temperature check, the overall time between power-on and a verified temperature is surprisingly close between these models, even if the Vicks thermometer spends less time in your mouth.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what your regular and elevated body temperatures are, then the color-coded fever warning might be helpful. It&#8217;s still a great idea to check and write down the body temperature of your family members (and yourself) on a day when you&#8217;re not sick, so you&#8217;ll have a better idea of how severe a fever is when it hits.</p>
<p>Five latex-free probe covers also come with this thermometer, and those are a must-have if you think you might ever want to do a rectal probe and then use the thermometer for anything else ever again.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re just sharing a thermometer among your kids for oral readings, the covers are still good to have on hand. Probe thermometers are washable, but you can&#8217;t immerse any of the models we tested in boiling water for sterilization. Fortunately, probe covers are universal-fit and available in drugstores.</p>

Big numerals and fast results make this very easy to use. This isn't the cheapest thermometer we found, but it's a great price for such a well-designed tool.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079V7C135/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The ADC briefly shows the saved records of the last reading taken when it powers up. This is just about perfect for tracking the course of a fever over a night. It&#8217;s not a replacement for writing down a normal temperature or a long-term record of changes, but it doesn&#8217;t require extra button-presses or troubleshooting a Bluetooth connection.</p>
<p>The thermometers we tested aren&#8217;t likely to be significantly more accurate than what you can find at your corner drugstore, and you could probably get a bare-bones thermometer for free if you ask around. Still, it’s nice having a model that&#8217;s easy to read and gives you quick results.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The ADC &#8211; Adtemp 418N probe thermometer is quick and simple to use.</li>
<li>Big, bold numerals are easy to read.</li>
<li>A temperature check takes about ten seconds, much quicker than most cheap thermometers.</li>
<li>The colored fever indication backlight is helpful, but it&#8217;s no replacement for knowing your own normal range.</li>
<li>A last-temperature display can help you track the progress of a fever, but it only shows for a second.</li>

<p>Of the probe thermometers we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GT7Y8GY/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vicks &#8211; Rapid Read</a> was the closest to earning a recommendation. Technically, it&#8217;s faster than the ADC if you&#8217;re doing an oral temperature check under the tongue: Once it&#8217;s ready, it only takes two seconds to give an accurate, consistent reading. That&#8217;s very impressive. But the whole power-on process takes about the same amount of time as other quick-reading thermometers.</p>
<p>In order to give that accurate reading, this model needs to know what part of your body you&#8217;re checking. There&#8217;s a three-second wait as the thermometer asks you to press the blue mode button if you want to choose a different location, or leave it on the default. The instruction manual also tells you how to change the default site from oral to armpit or rectal modes.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Vicks-starting-up.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>In all, the startup sequence takes eight seconds. When you add that time to a two-second oral temperature check, any speed advantage it has over other thermometers disappears. It spends less time in your mouth, but it wouldn’t be as intuitive if you handed it to someone who had never used it before.</p>

Those options make it more complicated to use, though, and we were left wishing for a simpler thermometer most of the time we used the Vicks.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GT7Y8GY/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Readings also change based on location. Armpit checks, for example, get about 10 seconds reading time instead of two. The thermometer even converts the temperatures to an oral equivalent—in our water bath test, it read one degree higher than expected in armpit mode and 0.6 degrees lower in rectal mode, which lines up with expected differences between those locations and a reading under the tongue.</p>
<p>On the whole, this is an accurate, reliable and versatile thermometer. The extra features make it very reliable, but only if you know how to use it. If you don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s converting temperatures, the changes could lead you to believe a fever is worse than it actually is.<br />
<strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Vicks &#8211; Rapid Read is very accurate, and has the quickest read time we&#8217;ve ever seen.</li>
<li>Vicks automatically adjusts rectal and armpit readings to oral temperature equivalents.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re not expecting a conversion, the readings you get will be confusing.</li>
<li>The startup time is quite long.</li>

<p>If you want the sleekest and simplest thermometer, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075QQ8VZW/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iHealth &#8211; PT3</a> non-contact forehead thermometer will be sure to impress. The iHealth only has one button and one reading mode, and it even uses a vibration motor rather than a beeper to tell you when it finishes checking. It&#8217;s not as versatile as the iProven, though, since it only gives you one method of scanning. It was also slightly less consistent than the Motorola in our tests.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TVS12U4/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun &#8211; NTF300US</a> was the first popular non-contact forehead thermometer, and it&#8217;s probably the model that gave us the most mixed results. Braun seems to have developed an updated model, but it&#8217;s not easy to find for sale. In our tests, the 300 model displayed a temperature a full degree below most others, though it was quite consistent. For the price, its poor reputation is too much of a risk when the other non-contact models we tested gave us the readings we expected to see.</p>
<p>If you want something that&#8217;s closer to a design tested in clinics and hospitals, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004T6G550/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Exergen &#8211; TAT200c SmartGlow</a> is based on a best-selling professional model. The display is very small, though. About the only major benefit this model has over the others we tested is a comprehensive instruction booklet, including suggestions for ways to verify forehead readings by checking behind the ear.</p>
<p>For those who need a smartphone app and don&#8217;t trust forehead readings, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y02OIK2/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kinsa &#8211; Smart Ear Thermometer</a> gives you Bluetooth-connected record-logging along with the accuracy of an eardrum measurement. In our tests, though, we didn&#8217;t see much reason to prefer ear readings, and the app doesn&#8217;t do anything more than a notepad would.</p>
<p>The only forehead scanner we found that uses touch, rather than infrared sensing, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003AGV8RU/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ADC &#8211; Temple Touch</a> is an inexpensive alternative. The metal contact patch has to be on your forehead for about 20 seconds, but it tells you when it&#8217;s working and seems reliable. It ranked low on our list, because it&#8217;s so much slower than any of the other thermometers we tested, and it&#8217;s difficult to tell if the metal pad is making contact when you&#8217;re checking yourself.</p>

<p>Another Bluetooth thermometer we tried was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0795ZW85G/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kinsa &#8211; QuickCare</a>. This simple probe thermometer has a lot going for it: accurate and consistent readings that are almost as quick as the ADC and Vicks probe models, plus Bluetooth if you want to track temperatures in an app.</p>
<p>The Kinsa&#8217;s downside is the short display time; after just 10 seconds, the temperature display resets. If you&#8217;re using the app that&#8217;s not a problem, but it could be annoying if you don&#8217;t check right away. The button is also harder to press than on the other probe thermometers.</p>
<p>Our final probe thermometer is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BDMGMLY/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iProven DT-R1221AWG</a>. It&#8217;s not much different than the ADC overall: It takes about as long to read a temperature, and it was a tiny bit more accurate in our tests. The display is smaller, though, and it wasn&#8217;t as consistent between tests. This isn&#8217;t a bad thermometer, but the ADC is a few dollars cheaper.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Getting an easy-to-use thermometer to measure fever symptoms is an essential part of stocking your medicine cabinet. You want a model that is accurate and consistent but isn’t difficult to use.</p>
<p>Different bodies work at different temperatures, over a range of about two-and-a-half degrees Fahrenheit. Whatever thermometer you get, it&#8217;s important to test it and learn how it works when you aren&#8217;t running a temperature, so you&#8217;ll know exactly how much hotter you&#8217;re running if you get sick.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ML4B1BC/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iProven &#8211; DMT-511</a> was the best forehead and ear thermometer for kids and adults, since it gives you two different reading modes that will help you verify if you&#8217;re getting the right numbers with your technique. It&#8217;s also easy to mute if you don&#8217;t want to disturb your sleeping sicky.</p>
<p>If you need to check a baby’s or small toddler’s temperature, it can be frustrating to get them to sit still even for a few seconds. That&#8217;s when an instant-scan touchless forehead thermometer like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0751FXJS1/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Motorola &#8211; MBP70SN</a> makes life better. The Bluetooth functions can help you track temperatures and remember medications, but they don&#8217;t get in the way of basic temperature checks.</p>
<p>Finally, if you&#8217;re looking for a basic, affordable thermometer to pop under your tongue without worrying about aiming a forehead thermometer or ear wax interfering with an ear scan, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079V7C135/?tag=ybdbodthrm-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ADC &#8211; Adtemp 418N</a> is quick, reliable and easy to read.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Teeth whitening products are, for the most part, re-packaged supplies made for dentists to use in-office or give to patients for home treatment under professional supervision.</p>
<p>The one whitening product that&#8217;s &#8220;accepted&#8221; for at-home use by the American Dental Association is Crest&#8217;s Whitestrips line, which is now in its second generation of products and branded &#8220;Crest 3D White.&#8221; This was an obvious place to start.</p>
<p>When we researched the most-purchased products, though, it&#8217;s pretty obvious that most people who want white smiles don&#8217;t mind buying at-home whitening products that aren&#8217;t formally approved.</p>
<p>Over-the-counter teeth whitening kits use low concentrations of peroxide and are not considered dangerous. The FDA does not regulate teeth whitening kits sold in the U.S. Of course, dentists are quick to point out the uncertainty that comes with this lack of regulation. Dentists have access to stronger whitening products and the training to use them safely.</p>
<p>Written reviews of whitening kits are typically vague about product recommendations, and we didn&#8217;t find any comparative reviews that assess kits against one another.</p>
<p>We did find lots of conversation about teeth whitening on the web. The conversation is mostly about how well whitening works, how quickly it works, and whether it&#8217;s safe to do at home. Subreddits like r/dentistry frequently discuss the pros and cons of at-home whitening.</p>
<p>We looked at the top-selling products available at local discount stores and on major online retailers, and after closely scrutinizing 35 different products and whitening systems, we bought 16 different products to test, including five kits, five types of whitening strips, three stand-alone tray kits and three whitening gel products not sold as kits.</p>
<p>Two of the highest-rated gels we bought, from Philips and Opalescence, are labelled for sale through a dentist but still designed for use at home.</p>
<p>After looking at the range available and talking to a dentist, we decided to test the most popular 35-percent strength in most kits to see if our tester had any sensitivity or other reactions. We also tried a few slightly stronger or slightly weaker solutions.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-whiten">How to whiten teeth at home</h2>
<p>Teeth whitening is very complex. Each person has different teeth and different stains, so it&#8217;s nearly impossible to say what success you&#8217;ll have with a particular whitening method. But the treatment itself is very simple, and the differences between products are minimal.</p>
<p>The ways that dentists will whiten your teeth are well-established. Dentists have been testing whitening treatments in their offices and with take-home kits for decades, and the methods haven&#8217;t changed much. The teeth whitening kits you can buy for yourself are, for the most part, the same thing you&#8217;d get from a dentist.</p>
<p>Whitening teeth involves bleaching built-up organic compounds like tannins from your teeth. This is more than just scrubbing a film off the surface: Whitening products actually remove stains from within the enamel.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>There are two compounds commonly used to achieve this bleaching: hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Unstable oxygen-rich molecules in these compounds quickly break down many (but not all) stains.</p>
<p><b>The two molecules are so similar because about 35 percent of carbamide peroxide </b><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/hydrogen-peroxide-urea" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>breaks down directly into hydrogen peroxide</b></a><b>, so the bleaching action is basically identical. </b>Carbamide is more stable in storage, which also makes it take longer to reach its maximum potential effect.</p>
<p>The big debate in teeth whitening is over the best way to evenly apply those peroxides to your teeth — and only to your teeth. Whitening strips stick a peroxide-laced gel onto the front of your teeth, while gel-filled trays can hold a stronger solution in place with a (low) risk of your swallowing it or burning your gums.</p>
<p>Toothpaste with peroxide can also help whiten teeth, though it&#8217;s in such a low concentration that you might never notice any gradual change.</p>
<h3>Charcoal teeth whitener</h3>
<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t try to scrub your stains off with an abrasive charcoal powder or use household cleaners in hopes of getting quick results. According to <a href="https://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177(17)30412-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies of popular products</a>, charcoal teeth whitener toothpaste is usually abrasive enough to do more harm than good. Gentle natural-alternative tooth polishes can be fine as a detergent-free way to keep your teeth clean, but don&#8217;t sacrifice your enamel to get a whiter smile.</p>

<p><b>Whitening strips:</b> The most basic and easiest type of whitening product, these strips of gel usually contain hydrogen peroxide and stick firmly to the surface of your teeth.</p>
<p><b>Trays:</b> If you want to keep a stronger solution of peroxide in better contact with all your front teeth, a tray keeps it on your teeth.</p>
<p>There are four types of trays available:</p>
<p><b>Universal-fit trays:</b> If you don&#8217;t want to go through the trouble of molding a tray to the shape of your teeth, this style will do the job and keep whitening solution or other dental products on your teeth, but they&#8217;re usually not comfortable to wear for more than a few minutes.</p>
<p><b>Heat-moldable trays: </b>These trays are made from a heat-moldable EVA plastic (related to what&#8217;s in a hot glue stick.) When you heat the tray in almost-boiling water, it becomes soft enough to take an impression of your teeth, and you can usually get a perfect fit. Once it’s cooled, you could trim the tray if you want, but the plastic is quite thick. These trays will warp if you rinse them in hot water or leave them in the sun, and then they&#8217;d need to be re-molded to fit.</p>
<p><b>Custom-made trays: </b>These trays are made by a dental service laboratory to fit exactly over plaster copies of your teeth, and excess tray material is trimmed back to the gumline. Your dentist&#8217;s office can make impressions of your teeth and handle the order, but we found many mail-order labs that will sell you a kit to make impressions at home.</p>
<p><b>Disposable Trays: </b>This is a new type of product from Opalescence. Their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IU5EDKK/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GO system</a> uses waxy, moldable trays that come pre-filled for full-coverage whitening without having to squirt any peroxide gel out of a tube.</p>

<p>Whitening strips are some of the most popular whitening products on the market, and for good reason: Starting with the introduction of Crest &#8211; Whitestrips in 2001, at-home whitening went from scary to dentist-approved.</p>
<p>The Crest line of whitening strips from Procter and Gamble is still the only at-home bleaching brand with the <a href="https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/ada-seal-products/category-display?category=Bleaching+Products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Dental Association&#8217;s Seal of Acceptance</a>. That means they&#8217;ve paid a lot of money to run patient trials to show that the product works as described and is safe.</p>
<p>One downside to whitening strips is that the peroxide-carrying gel isn&#8217;t able to fill in all the nooks and crannies of your smile: If you have overlapping or crooked teeth, the strips are likely to whiten the forward-facing parts and leave other parts untouched.</p>
<p>The other downside to whitening strips is that manufacturers use vague terms to describe the strength of what you&#8217;re buying. Percentages of active carbamide or hydrogen peroxide are always listed for gel-and-tray systems, but the concentration of active ingredients are rarely listed on whitening strips.</p>
<h2 id="side-effects">Who should avoid teeth whitening?</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/whitening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADA&#8217;s summary of clinical trials</a>, sensitivity and gum irritation are the primary known side effects of whitening. These side-effects will subside, but for a weeks-long course of treatment you&#8217;ll want to know what you&#8217;re in for.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got cavities, whitening could put hydrogen peroxide directly in contact with the nerves and blood vessels in your roots, so if you have any suspicion of decay, you should definitely get a check-up before whitening.</p>
<p>If your gums are irritated already — even just from eating something like popcorn — you&#8217;ll be more likely to feel a sting from the whitening gel if you get it on your gums. Some of the kits we tested recommend rinsing with salt water before a whitening treatment to determine if your gums will be hyper-sensitive to the peroxide.</p>
<p>Another warning we saw in whitening directions is about uneven whitening: Mineral deposits will not bleach at the same rate as the rest of your enamel. Likewise, if you&#8217;ve got veneers, partial prosthetic teeth or anything other than tooth enamel in your smile, whitening products will only bleach your real tooth surfaces.</p>

<p>The sad reality is that quick-acting whitening products are also more likely to make your teeth hurt. Studies have shown a <a href="https://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-65/issue-4/201.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64-percent rate of complaint</a> among patients with a fairly low concentration of 10-percent carbamide peroxide (or 3.6-percent hydrogen peroxide) which still takes 2 to 3 days of hours-long treatment to show any results.</p>
<p>When we asked officemates about their experiences with teeth whitening (whether at a dentist&#8217;s office or at home), we got similar feedback: Not everyone will have problems with tooth pain after whitening, but many people do.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vanhaywood.com/uploads/articlespage/NGVB%20Limit%20Indic%20JapUKTB06.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Dr. Van Haywood</a>, increasing the strength of the peroxide solution doesn&#8217;t give a linear increase in whitening performance, which means that doubling the strength won&#8217;t necessarily whiten twice as fast. But the effect on sensitivity does increase more directly, so if you&#8217;re trying out at-home whitening you&#8217;ll probably want to stick with a lower-strength product and plan to use it for longer.</p>
<p>The good news, is that you don&#8217;t sacrifice overall results with weaker solutions: Teeth will only whiten a certain amount with these treatments, so using extra-strong products just gets you there more quickly.</p>
<p>Many dentists will suggest a sensitivity-fighting toothpaste like Sensodyne, which contains fluoride and potassium nitrate, both of which <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11820045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been shown in studies to help reduce sensitivity</a> without reducing the effectiveness of whitening gels. We found suggestions on Reddit that you should start brushing with a sensitivity-fighting toothpaste (or massaging it into your teeth) even weeks before you start bleaching.</p>
<p>Some whitening gels we tested already have potassium nitrate and fluoride in the gel, including the two big-name products we tested: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom DayWhite</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00147X6DQ/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opalescence &#8211; PF</a>. The less-expensive all-in-one at-home kits did not have these ingredients.</p>
<p>Philips also adds a re-mineralizing &#8220;amorphous calcium phosphate&#8221; solution in their whitening gel that’s designed to help restore the surface of your teeth. This is the main reason we found to buy the more expensive whitening gel; in most other ways they&#8217;re identical to other carbamide or hydrogen peroxide solutions on the market.</p>
<p>If you want to stick to the more commonly available whitening products, you can still help reduce sensitivity with a specialized toothpaste containing stannous fluoride, potassium nitrate, Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP) or Colgate&#8217;s proprietary &#8220;pro-argin&#8221; treatment. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078HQ48JX/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sensodyne&#8217;s fluoride-and-potassium</a> product is the best-known over-the-counter brand in the U.S., but ask your dentist about specialized products that might suit your particular sensitivity.</p>
<p>Nova-min is another compound that has worked very well in clinical trials, but after GlaxoSmithKline bought the rights in 2012, they&#8217;ve basically removed it from the North American market. You can buy Nova-min toothpaste from overseas, if you&#8217;re willing to pay a premium. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EF39784/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here&#8217;s an Amazon listing for the import Sensodyne formula</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-day-results">Can you whiten teeth in one day?</h2>
<p>Ideally, a tooth whitening system would work instantly. Few of us plan what we&#8217;ll look like at important meetings or in photographs much more than a week in advance, much less a month’s worth of hour-a-day treatments.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, the downside to using stronger concentrations of whitening agents is sensitivity, but there&#8217;s another factor to remember: Whitening results vary, and you might not get any better result with an expensive in-office treatment than you would with a take-home kit.</p>
<p>If your dentist offers in-office &#8220;power bleaching&#8221; treatment, you&#8217;ll probably have access to the latest in light-activation tools and stronger concentrations of whitening product than you&#8217;d be comfortable using at home. If you really only have one day, a dentist will be able to give you reliable and safe results.</p>
<p>If you have the time, however, a long-term treatment should be just as effective (and much more affordable) than in-office options.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s one major hurdle to testing whitening products: Everyone&#8217;s results will be different. No two smiles are alike, and you can&#8217;t know if the stains that you have will be as easy to remove as another person&#8217;s. We tested with a single subject who has mildly sensitive teeth and no cavities or gum problems.</p>
<p>That said, there&#8217;s a reason all of these products use hydrogen peroxide (and carbamide peroxide, which breaks down to become hydrogen peroxide) as their whitening agent. It&#8217;s been proven to work, and it&#8217;s predictable. Every whitening system designed for effective at-home use is based on peroxide bleaching.</p>
<p>We bought 13 different whitening products, and our tester used them over the course of three months, focusing mostly on differentiating ease of use rather than the effect of the active ingredients.</p>
<p>We tested the activity of the peroxide gels in a coffee-stain test to make sure that these kits aren&#8217;t including fake or watered-down supplies, but it&#8217;s impossible for us to say anything more conclusive than that about results.</p>

<p>First, we laid out each kit and compared the instructions given. We found that the guidance from each product was similar, though some kits were definitely more thorough.</p>
<p>Instructions for shaping the mouthguard were almost always more detailed than instructions for applying the whitening product itself. Instructions for using whitening strips, which we admit are a fairly simple type of product to use, were almost non-existent.</p>
<p>We were expecting some clarification or guidance related to how long to use each product, but in most cases the recommended treatment times included wide ranges and seemed almost arbitrary. If you leave the bleach on your teeth longer, you&#8217;ll get more of an effect, but these suppliers are wary of making promises.</p>
<p>Standout instructions came with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a>, which is a good thing since a mistake mixing silicone putty and taking an impression could result in a wasted kit. Thankfully, Sparkling White Smiles also offers an extra tray’s worth of impression putty.</p>
<h3>Ease of molding process</h3>
<p>Timing is important with two-part silicone putty, since it hardens within a minute of mixing, but the heat-molded trays in the other kits required watching for signs that the walls were beginning to droop and acting immediately. One tray left in for a few seconds too long stuck to itself (like the instructions warned) and required a complete do-over.</p>
<p>Most kits include spare heat-moldable tray materials, just in case. Instructions for the kits were adequate, with no real stand-out winners. The timing for when to remove the tray from the hot water, when to put it in your mouth, and keeping all the edges from sticking together was surprisingly complex but manageable.</p>
<h3>Fit and comfort</h3>
[table id=288 /]
<p>Our tester used each tray-style kit to make impressions of his teeth. For most of the heat-shaped trays, the fitting process was repeated once or twice to get a comfortable and secure fit that wouldn&#8217;t leak whitening gel out or saliva in.</p>
<p>The trays from the Sparkling White Smiles lab were, of course, the best-fitting. The quality of fit from the shape-it-yourself trays was surprisingly good, despite our tester&#8217;s lack of experience with the process. Thinner material, like the AuraGlow and Cali White trays used, was easiest to shape.</p>
<p>We tested three other generic heat-formable whitening tray products to see if there was any difference between what&#8217;s included with whitening kits and other popular options. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nova White</a> is the only company selling trays that are notably different, with thicker, textured plastic that curls rapidly if you let it get too hot. With some practice, the thicker plastic allows for an excellent fit.</p>
<p>Two kits we tested included universal-fit trays that don&#8217;t require heat-molding. Cali White includes this as an option along with two trays you can heat-mold, but the highly-rated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079SNKQJX/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MySmile &#8211; Teeth Whitening Kit</a> only has a universal tray.</p>
<p>After trying two days of whitening with the giant trays, we don&#8217;t recommend them at all. This is definitely one-size-fits nobody, and for our tester, having a giant piece of plastic wedged in his mouth only led to uncomfortable half-hour sessions dealing with excessive saliva.</p>
<p>If heating the custom-fit trays scares you off, then whitening strips or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IU5EDKK/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opalescence &#8211; GO</a> system are better options.</p>
<h3>Bleach strength</h3>
<p>We tested the strength of each solution on a piece of paper dyed with concentrated coffee.</p>
<p>The big surprise with this test is that whitening strips and some of the thicker gels are basically inactive unless they get wet. On dry paper, they had almost no bleaching effect at all. But after we washed the residue off the paper from the first test, we started to see bleaching in those areas.</p>
<p>The relative difference in activity between the different solutions, which range from an equivalent of 6-percent hydrogen peroxide up to 15 percent, was hard to see in this test. The difference in effect was more noticeable between thick and thin gel than it was between strong and weak concentrations.</p>
<p>Based on what we&#8217;ve read about the effects of peroxide bleaching on different people, it seems like a weaker solution over a longer period of time will have the best outcome. This means more time with the trays in your mouth, and also more days before you start expecting results, but usually less pain from sensitized teeth.</p>
<p>That said, the common 35-percent carbamide peroxide gel included in most over-the-counter kits is popular for a reason. You should see some results in a week, even with half-hour daily whitening sessions.</p>
<h2 id="led-whitening-kits">Does LED whitening do anything?</h2>
<p>LED lights is the most polarizing part of over-the-counter whitening systems. It&#8217;s obviously an effective marketing strategy for companies like HiSmile and Express Smile Atlanta capitalizing on celebrity instagram endorsements.</p>
<p>Three of the kits we purchased included lights: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072LF2356/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cali White &#8211; Deluxe Whitening System</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079SNKQJX/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MySmile &#8211; Teeth Whitening Kit</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M63SQTI/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crest &#8211; 3D White Whitestrips with Light</a>.</p>
<p>Theoretically, these lights could possibly make a small difference by heating up the peroxide and drying out your enamel.</p>
<p>Note that the ADA does list the whole Crest &#8211; 3D White line as &#8220;accepted,&#8221; but <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/whitening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they also clearly state</a> that from their reviews of published research they don&#8217;t think light-activation makes a difference.</p>
<p>The lights included with over-the-counter kits aren&#8217;t even close to the equivalent of a light-activated treatment at your dentist&#8217;s office. Those machines use a laser or other high-wattage system, not 50 cents worth of cheap LED emitters. Even those expensive in-office light systems might not be making much of a difference, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4178330/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some studies show</a>.</p>

<p>We tried these three LED systems for a few sessions, to be thorough, but then we tried some control tests on paper and an eggshell. Masking off part of the test surface with foil to see if the light was making a difference, our tests showed no change in whitening with the light, even after 10 repeated treatments.</p>
<p>Our tester was happy to put all the LED parts back into the boxes and go back to whitening with just trays and gel. Taking a selfie with a strange device hanging out of your mouth is kind of cute, but it&#8217;s awkward enough wearing just trays or strips every day.</p>
<p>After looking at research and actually trying the LED systems, we can&#8217;t help thinking this phenomenon is an elaborate prank.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> is a professional-grade whitening setup at a price that&#8217;s almost impossible to beat. For about the same price as a few boxes of Crest &#8211; Whitestrips, you get truly custom-crafted whitening trays and a generous supply of carbamide peroxide gel.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever had orthodontic work done, you probably know the teeth impression procedure: A dental assistant has you bite down on a plastic tray filled with silicone putty, then after the putty solidifies they send away the impressions to make castings of your teeth. After that, they can more easily make dental devices that fit the exact shape of your teeth.</p>
<p>Lab-made whitening trays use exactly that same procedure, but in the age of next-day shipping, you can get trays made without an office visit and at a much lower price. Yes, you have to mix the putty yourself, but that&#8217;s one of the few differences between this kit and getting trays made at the dentist.</p>

<p>Mixing and molding the impressions of your teeth with the included putty is a straightforward procedure, and the instructions included are thorough. The two pieces of putty are a little bit firmer than silly putty, and the colors make it easy to see when you&#8217;ve mashed them together long enough to mix. You then have a few minutes to press your teeth into the putty with the provided tray and wait for it to harden.</p>
<p>If you have difficulty making one set of impressions, Sparkling White Smiles includes enough putty to make one extra impression, and they&#8217;ll walk you through the process if you run into major trouble.</p>

After you send in your impressions these trays will get back to you in a few weeks, and then you'll have a complete at-home whitening setup just like your dentist would sell you.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Once you make your impressions, drop the trays and address form in the mail and your completed trays will be mailed back to you in two weeks. If you&#8217;re in more of a hurry than that, Sparkling White Smiles also offers rush shipping for $22. You have to include a check or credit card info for express service or spare trays.</p>
<p>You can also order a custom-fit soft night guard that&#8217;s thicker than the whitening trays for an extra $46. The whitening trays are thin, so if you&#8217;ve got a major teeth-grinding problem, you might want to shell out for the dedicated guard. $46 isn&#8217;t cheap, but this is still much less than paying most dentists to have a guard made.</p>
<h3>The rest of the kit</h3>
<p>Based on the trays alone, the relatively high cost of the Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System might make the popular mold-it-yourself tray kits like AuraGlow a more obvious option. With enough gel for 50 treatments, though, the $80 we paid for this system was well worth it.</p>
<p>The gel included with the Sparkling White Smiles kit is 22-percent carbamide peroxide. That&#8217;s weaker than many popular kits, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing. Many dentists recommend concentrations as low as 10 percent for at-home treatment, with much longer treatment times to ensure maximum effectiveness. The instructions suggest treating for 30 minutes twice daily with this solution, which is more tray time but less risk of tooth pain than other systems.</p>
<p>Other manufacturers selling the same strength of product, like Opalescence, suggest up to two hours of treatment time with this strength of solution, but it&#8217;s best to consult your dentist if you have specific questions about finding the right treatment regimen for your teeth.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want the very best at-home whitening system, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> gets you a professional fit for less than $100.</li>
<li>Mailing in impressions of your teeth is an extra step, but that&#8217;s still a lot quicker than making two dentist appointments.</li>
<li>The fit and feel of these trays is perfect, and taking impressions went smoothly.</li>
<li>Sparkling White Smiles includes enough 22-percent carbamide peroxide gel for about 50 treatments.</li>

<p>Lovely Smile suggests applying these thrips for 15 to 30 minutes during your first go, and for one hour per day after that. The kit contains enough strips for two weeks of whitening treatments, the same treatment length as Crest Whitestrips.</p>
<p>As we hope has been made clear, there&#8217;s no way to say exactly how effective any particular treatment will be for your teeth, but these strips are a low-risk way to start.</p>
<p>As with any whitening strips, the biggest problem is applying them carefully and evenly. It seems the peroxide in these strips is weak enough that they&#8217;re not likely to cause any harm, but you wouldn&#8217;t want to stick them to your gums every day. If you do find your gums sensitive after using strips, the irritation is temporary and should go away quickly.</p>
<p>Some dentists recommend trimming whitening strips so that they&#8217;re only a wide as you need to cover your most visible teeth, since nobody can tell how white your molars are. Excess strip material means more chance it&#8217;ll be touching your gums or even the roof of your mouth on the inside. The Lovely Smile strips are as easy to trim as the other brands are, and it&#8217;s reassuring that the pieces you&#8217;re throwing away aren&#8217;t as expensive.</p>

Hydrogen peroxide is a proven ingredient for strip-based whitening, and the menthol helps you know if you've applied them correctly.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The only drawback to Lovely Smile strips in particular is the hour-long recommended treatment time: strips are pretty easy to get used to compared to trays, but by the time an hour is up you&#8217;ll be ready to get them out of your mouth. The Crest &#8211; Glamorous White and Solimo strips have instructions for half-hour treatment times.</p>
<p>A tingle from the menthol additive in these strips is also a good indicator that you’ve started dissolving the gel in your saliva or that it&#8217;s stuck to your gum tissue instead of your teeth.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re done with your daily hour of strip-wearing, you&#8217;ll definitely want a place to rinse and brush your teeth. A paper towel works in a pinch to wipe the gel off, but it&#8217;s very sticky stuff. Most of the strips we tested were the same in this regard.</p>
<h3>The drawbacks of whitening strips</h3>
<p>As with any product like this, the sticky gel on the Lovely White strip has to touch your tooth enamel to whiten it. If you&#8217;ve got irregular teeth that overlap or otherwise prevent even contact, strips could inadvertently whiten only some parts of your teeth. Trays are a much better way to go in that case.</p>
<p>If you want the assurance that comes from the American Dental Association seal of acceptance, you&#8217;re going to have to spend about double the price of these strips to get the guarantees of Crest&#8217;s famous white strips. The results you get from the Lovely White strips should be the same.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lovely White &#8211; Bright Smile whitening strips</a> are basically the same as most other whitening strips, but they don&#8217;t cost as much.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;re turned off by the lesser-known brands recommended above, you&#8217;re in luck: You can buy the same whitening products online that your dentist will sell you, usually at a much lower cost. Our pick is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom Day White</a> system. This product doesn&#8217;t come with trays, but that&#8217;s easy to address with off-the-shelf heat-molded trays like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this affordable set from Nova White</a>.</p>
<p>Zoom is a whitening system that&#8217;s been used by dentists since the 1990s. Philips bought Zoom from Discus Dental in 2010, and it&#8217;s now one of the top systems used in dental offices.</p>
<p>We picked Zoom over other high-concentration formulas for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, Philips uses hydrogen peroxide rather than carbamide peroxide, and it should work better in short treatment sessions for most people than the equivalent concentration of carbamide peroxide.</p>
<p>Second, Philips includes a remineralization and sensitivity-fighting formula in this package. Potassium nitrate is the same active ingredient used in sensitivity-numbing toothpaste, and Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP) should help restore the surface of your tooth enamel.</p>
<p>Yes, you can get these sensitivity treatments in a toothpaste, but if you&#8217;re already spending half an hour every day putting fancy goop on your teeth, why not kill two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>Even buying it on Amazon, Zoom isn&#8217;t exactly a bargain. Compared to the rock-bottom price of 47 cents per treatment when you&#8217;re buying generic carbamide gel and heat-molded trays, or a cost of $1.60 per treatment for the perfect fit you get with the Sparkling White Smiles kit, the $3.87 per-treatment cost of the Philips system (including a $10 for a separate set of trays) is steep. But it&#8217;s comparable to the cost of some popular all-in-one kits, and you&#8217;re getting sensitivity treatment along with the higher-strength whitening solution.</p>

If you're looking for the fastest results you can get without booking an expensive hyper-bleach at your dentist, this is a good alternative.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The downside to buying professional-grade whitening gel on the internet is that these items aren&#8217;t actually intended to be sold direct-to-consumer. That is, they&#8217;re intended to be sold to you by a dentist, not by a dental supply warehouse running an Amazon store.</p>
<p>This whitening gel is designed for at-home with the guidance of a dentist, and the instructions are written that way. Also, Philips won’t give you a refund as Crest will if you aren&#8217;t happy with your results.</p>
<p>That said, 14-percent peroxide is still low compared to the products dentists will use for one-day whitening treatments. This stuff will sting if it gets on your gums, but it&#8217;s not dangerous unless you put it in your eye.</p>
<h3>Affordable, high-quality trays: NovaWhite</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re buying the Philips &#8211; Zoom gel by itself, you&#8217;ll also need trays. This is the trickiest part of at-home whitening: Heat-molded trays included in most kits are good enough, but they&#8217;re not foolproof.</p>
<p>Our pick for a stand-alone tray to go with Zoom refills is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NovaWhite heat moldable trays</a>: They conform very well to your teeth and they&#8217;re a bargain at less than $10 for a set of four.</p>
<p>That said, the NovaWhite trays do curl over just a bit more quickly when you&#8217;re heating them in hot water than some of the other trays. We found these to be excellent trays for a low price, but plan on shaping both pairs of trays to get the best fit, and follow the instructions about heating time carefully.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to use name-brand whitening gel like your dentist will sell you, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom Day White</a> is one of the best.</li>
<li>Philips tempers the strength of this 14-percent peroxide solution with sensitivity-fighting potassium nitrate.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s also a calcium-restoring gel in this solution</li>
<li>Zoom also comes in lower concentrations, but this is our pick for a fast-acting whitening solution.</li>

<h3>AuraGlow &#8211; Radiant Effects</h3>
<p>If you want a complete kit that provides good value, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7Y5P9D/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AuraGlow &#8211; Radiant Effects whitening kit</a> is popular for a reason. The trays included in this kit were a little bit easier to heat and mold than most, with good instructions that resulted in a good fit the first time with no tweaking necessary.</p>
<p>After making seven complete sets of kits, we rank this set close to the top. AuraGlow&#8217;s trays give you a little more leeway when you&#8217;re trying to decide if it&#8217;s time to pull them out of the water. The tray material doesn&#8217;t just curl over and stick to itself if it&#8217;s in the hot water two seconds too long.</p>
<p>Your results may vary, of course, with do-it-yourself heat-molded trays. That&#8217;s why we picked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> as our top choice. The thicker, softer plastic of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NovaWhite</a> trays also felt just a little bit tighter overall once we tweaked them with a re-heat and a second attempt at getting a perfect fit.</p>
<p>The gel that comes with the AuraGlow kit isn&#8217;t any worse than what comes with the Sparkling White Smiles kit; it&#8217;s a bit stronger, but you should be careful about keeping it off your gums either way. At $1.50 per application, this set is about half the cost of buying Philips &#8211; Zoom refills and a set of trays, without any of the fancy additives included there.</p>
<p>Compared to the cost of the very least-expensive products available, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BLXG5U/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SensAllis gel refills</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nova White trays</a>, this kit looks more expensive. Buying the most economical supplies comes out to one third the price-per-application of an AuraGlow kit, though you might never use up all that gel.</p>
<p>On the whole, the AuraGlow kit makes the most sense if you intend to stop whitening after using the one month of included treatments. A month of 35-percent carbamide should theoretically get you all the improvement you&#8217;re likely to see, but results vary.</p>
<h3>Cali White &#8211; Deluxe Whitening System</h3>
<p>If you just have to have a selfie with an LED light for your Instagram story, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072LF2356/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cali White &#8211; Deluxe Whitening System</a> is the LED-bundle kit we&#8217;d pick over the others we checked out.</p>
<p>For about $5 more than AuraGlow&#8217;s kit, Cali White includes a universal-fit tray, which is actually much more awkward than it looks. The included heat-moldable trays are practically identical to the trays included with AuraGlow&#8217;s kit, and you get the same amount of carbamide peroxide gel.</p>
<p>Cali White goes out of their way to promote the benefits of baking soda, cranberry seed extract and aloe in their whitening gel, but it&#8217;s still carbamide peroxide doing the work.</p>
<p>The LED light included is kind of neat, but so far as we can tell it doesn&#8217;t speed up whitening in any way. We tried it, and it&#8217;s more annoying than it could possibly be worth.</p>
<p>Overall, the Cali White kit isn&#8217;t a bad buy for the trays and peroxide gel, but there&#8217;s no reason to pick it over the AuraGlow system.</p>
<h3>Opalescence &#8211; GO</h3>
<p>The take-home universal-fit <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IU5EDKK/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opalescence &#8211; GO</a> system is unique in that it offers many of the advantages of both tray systems and whitening strips.</p>
<p>This product includes a universal-fit tray that&#8217;s pre-filled with Opalescence hydrogen peroxide gel, but it&#8217;s a moldable wax tray. You put the plastic holder over your teeth, squeeze the tray to fit just right, then remove the plastic.</p>
<p>Sadly, this isn&#8217;t as easy as it sounds. The trays are quite large to fit a wider range of mouth sizes, which means you need to carefully judge how far up and back to move them before you can squeeze them into shape.</p>
<p>These trays have far more gel than we&#8217;ve seen suggested by any filling instructions in other kits — there&#8217;s even gel for the inside of your back molars, just in case your date is shining a flashlight into your mouth.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re squeezing gel around as you mold the tray to fit your teeth, and this is Opalescent&#8217;s thick glue-like gel, not the watery stuff most kits come with. It&#8217;ll stay in place fairly well, but it&#8217;s not as easy to wipe off your gums.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of how these trays work, they can be made to fit very well. Opalescence is popular with dentists, so if you have questions about strength or timing your regular dentist might be more likely to give you advice. It&#8217;s not as comfortable using this system as strips or custom-made trays, but it&#8217;s better than non-molded trays.</p>
<p>On the whole, we&#8217;re not sold on the value of this product. It&#8217;s not really harder to learn how to fit a heat-molded plastic tray than these waxy trays, and this product is far more expensive than anything else we tested.</p>
<p>At nearly $6 per set of trays, the best reason to go with this system is if you want to share a package with someone for a quick week of touch-up whitening, or you really hate the idea of squeezing hot plastic into your mouth.</p>

<h3>Solimo &#8211; 10-day kit</h3>
<p>Direct from whatever factory makes all of these strips for everyone, Amazon brings you their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CNW4LN5/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Solimo-branded 10-day whitening kit.</a> With the same active ingredients as Crest &#8211; 3D White Whitestrips and the slightly less-expensive Lovely Smile strips, the main reason to pick this set would be if the Lovely White 14-pack is out of stock. The differences between the products are minimal.</p>
<h3>Crest &#8211; 3D White Whitestrips</h3>
<p>We tested both the 3D White <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OOLLVS/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glamorous White</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M63SQTI/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">&#8220;With Light&#8221;</a> packages, and the differences are, again, minimal. In our control test to check peroxide-bleaching activity, these strips gave very similar results on coffee stains. The main difference is the taller, narrower strip you&#8217;re given for your bottom teeth in the Glamorous White packages, and of course the $34 LED light.</p>
<p>Crest&#8217;s &#8220;With Light&#8221; package also comes with directions that suggest using the strips for a full hour, rather than Glamorous White’s half-hour. It&#8217;s possible that the hydrogen peroxide solution is weaker in the “With Light” package, but Crest might also be using the difference in directions to suggest better results from the more expensive kit.</p>
<p>The LED light from Crest, as in the other kits, showed no effect on the activity of the peroxide in a controlled bleaching test. It&#8217;s possible it could warm your teeth slightly, but it&#8217;s a very small and low-power light source.</p>
<p>The one edge Crest has over the other strip-type whitening kits is that they&#8217;ve spent a lot of money getting the necessary research in place to earn the <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/press-room/news-releases/2017-archives/june/crest-3d-white-glamorous-white-whitestrips-to-receive-ada-seal-of-acceptance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Dental Association&#8217;s Seal of Acceptance</a>. While that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean this system is better than other whitening products, it does mean that it has been proven to work safely in a lot of tests.</p>
<p>Crest (owned by Procter and Gamble) is the only consumer-sale whitening product manufacturer that has successfully applied for the Seal on a whitening product. They&#8217;re in a similar place to P&amp;G&#8217;s Oral-B <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-electric-toothbrush/">electric toothbrushes that we tested</a>: This brand proven, but that doesn&#8217;t mean other brands are selling ineffective products. The ADA won&#8217;t tell us if a company has ever paid up and still failed to earn the Seal on an over-the-counter product.</p>
<h3>Lumist</h3>
<p>The whitening strips from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BFWQEZG/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lumist</a> are the most unique of all the strips we researched. Rather than have just a plastic backing on a sticky peroxide-carrying gel, Lumist makes their backing more formable and stretchy. You can mold these strips around tooth features that the other strips will just bubble and crease on, ironically making Lumist a more three-dimensional solution that Crest&#8217;s so-called 3D Whitestrips.</p>
<p>Lumist uses 20-percent carbamide peroxide in these strips, which makes them faster-acting than other strips and potentially as quick as a tray and gel solution. The price of the Lumist strips is the weak point, though; at $6 per treatment, they’re almost as expensive as the stronger and more comfortable-to-wear Opalescence &#8211; GO trays.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Whitening your teeth at home is a bit like changing your own oil: it&#8217;s not for everyone, but nearly anyone can learn how to do it if they&#8217;re motivated. It&#8217;ll also save you some money.</p>
<p>For the best results, you want a set of plastic trays that will be comfortable to wear for a half-hour to an hour at a time. These trays should also conform exactly to your teeth, keeping the whitening solution on your enamel and off your gums.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HL82SV8/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sparkling White Smiles &#8211; Custom Tray System</a> gives you the precision and quality of a tray your dentist could sell you, but without the overhead of paying for an in-office assistant to mix the silicone putty. Along with excellent trays, you get an all-inclusive package with enough whitening gel to last for months.</p>
<p>If $80 is more than you can afford to spend on whiter teeth, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1X3I1W/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lovely Smile &#8211; Bright White</a> whitening strips will get you two weeks of basic treatment for less than $20. You can expect to see a basic improvement in shade with this system, and whitening strips are recommended by even the most cautious dentists.</p>
<p>If you need speedy results, we like the higher-concentration, fast-acting hydrogen peroxide offered in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0141J993Y/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philips &#8211; Zoom Day White</a> system. This solution comes with sensitivity-fighting and mineral-restoring compounds mixed in, so the extra sensitivity from faster-acting peroxide should be minimized. You&#8217;ll need to buy trays like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VGI5KBY/?tag=ybdtwht-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">these from Nova White</a> separately, though.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by reading consumer reviews of the best deodorants available from major retailers like Amazon, Target and Walmart. We examined types of products available, online ratings, user comments and bestselling options. We also read a wide range of related health and beauty articles and blogs on the topic.</p>
<p>We identified four major deodorant categories:  antiperspirant, clinical strength, natural and spray.  However, it is possible for a single deodorant to be classified into more than one of these categories. For example, a spray can also be either a natural product or an antiperspirant, and clinical strength products are all antiperspirants, as well. We then narrowed our search down to four or five well-loved products in each major category — 17 finalists in total — and put them through side-by-side product testing.</p>
<h2 id="lineup">Compare the best deodorant for women</h2>
[table id=239 /]
<h2 id="types">Types of deodorant</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever wondered why the human body stinks and sweats, <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150330213947.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science Daily</a> explains that “the smell is caused by bacteria on the skin breaking down naturally secreted molecules contained within sweat.” You could try to cover up the smell, stop the sweat or do a combination of both, but you need an effective deodorant and/or antiperspirant.</p>
<p>Deodorants fight body odor-related bacteria and cover up the smell. Antiperspirants limit or completely stop underarm sweating.</p>
<p>The difference between men’s and women’s deodorants is mostly in how they are marketed. The actual active ingredients are almost identical. Certain fragrances appeal more to men, but if you prefer the scent, packaging or price point of a men’s deodorant, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t give it a try.</p>
<p>No matter what type of deodorant you choose, keep in mind that deodorant is body-specific. People may react differently to the same product, and what works well for one person might not work at all for someone else.</p>
<h2 id="health">Antiperspirant health concerns</h2>
<p>Antiperspirants have been criticized in recent years for their active ingredients — specifically aluminum compounds — that  temporarily restrict the release of moisture from the sweat glands in the underarms.  These aluminum compounds are purported to be linked to breast cancer. Even though there is <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/breast-defense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no scientific evidence to support these claims</a>, many people switched from using antiperspirant deodorants to natural, aluminum-free products or stopped using deodorant altogether.</p>
<p>Some studies also suggest a possible link between <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/does-aluminum-in-pans-and-antiperspirants-lead-to-alzheimers-disease/2013/05/03/e2726998-ae75-11e2-98ef-d1072ed3cc27_story.html?utm_term=.ef94385a6154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aluminum and Alzheimer’s disease</a>. Overall, however, research is inconclusive.</p>
<p>A growing movement to go without deodorant has <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/What-Happens-When-You-Stop-Wearing-Deodorant-44660720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pros and cons</a>. The cons are pretty obvious, but people who stop wearing deodorant claim that your body gradually adjusts and stops secreting excessive odor and sweat.</p>
<p>You’d certainly save money by not using deodorant, and by reducing your use of plastics, you would help the environment as well. Of course, you could also smell nice and be eco-friendly by looking into <a href="https://www.lushusa.com/body/deodorants-and-dusting-powders/teo/00433.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7_WL-NCv4QIVlRh9Ch30mA9DEAAYASAAEgIElfD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plastic-free deodorant options</a>.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>As reported by <i>The Washington Post</i>, deodorant is an $18 billion-a-year industry<i>. </i>There is an overwhelming range of products on the market, and you should consider several important features before purchasing the one that’s right for you.</p>
<h3>Odor control</h3>
<p>For most people, controlling body odor is key. While aluminum compounds reduce sweat, other deodorant ingredients specifically fight odor-causing bacteria. Antibacterial ingredients — like alcohol or triclosan — are both effective options. Artificial and natural fragrances are also used to mask unpleasant smells.</p>
<h3>Wetness control</h3>
<p>If you’re concerned about controlling underarm moisture from sweat, we’d recommend a product containing an aluminum-based antiperspirant. These ingredients are listed under “Active Ingredient” on product labels and include aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY, aluminum chlorohydrate and aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrex.</p>
<p>You’ll also find a percentage of how much of the ingredient is used in the product. This amount varies. Clinical-strength deodorants offer the highest amount of active antiperspirant ingredients and, therefore, the highest level of wetness protection.</p>
<p>A couple of the clinical strength products we tested, for example, contain 20 percent of the active ingredient aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY, which is the maximum amount allowed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for over-the-counter sale. All active ingredients found in antiperspirants are regulated by the FDA for safety. For comparison purposes, other antiperspirant deodorant solids that we tested range from 15.2 percent to 19.3 percent.</p>
<p>If you perspire heavily, a higher percentage of active ingredients will be more effective for controlling underarm moisture. The level of concentration is the key differentiator in antiperspirant effectiveness. Prescription-strength products, which are even stronger than clinical-strength ones, may also be of interest; consult your doctor to explore this option.</p>
<h3>Natural ingredients</h3>
<p>Many natural deodorants promote the use of mineral salts to provide odor and wetness control. These ingredients have not been scientifically proven to be effective; however, some individuals find them helpful. When it comes to effective control of body odor and wetness, we found that natural products simply aren’t as effective as antiperspirant deodorants.</p>
<h3>Initial scent</h3>
<p>The fragrance of the deodorant upon application should be considered. Do you like the way it smells and the way it interacts with your natural fragrance? Because this is a personal preference, it might be helpful if a particular product line has a variety of different scents from which to choose. You can then experiment with various scent options without risking any lapse in protection.</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>The delivery method varies and includes solids, gels, roll-ons, sprays or creams. The style and shape of the applicator, along with texture of the product, can have an impact on personal comfort.</p>

<p><strong>Solids:</strong> A solid or stick deodorant is one common option. These deodorants are swiped onto the skin and go on the driest of any deodorant product but can leave small amounts of white residue on clothing. They generally come in small, plastic containers that can be tucked into a purse, glove compartment or office desk drawer for use away from home.</p>

<p><strong>Gels:</strong> These come in a similar style bottle to solids but are softer and wetter in consistency. To apply, you twist the bottom of the bottle to push gel through slits in the plastic top. Gels feel wet and often cold upon application, but because most gels are clear in color, they leave little to no residue on clothing.</p>

<p><strong>Roll-ons:</strong> Liquid deodorants are rolled on to the skin through a roller-ball top. They go on very wet, so users can easily feel exactly which areas have been covered. Most are clear in color and tend to leave little, if any, residue on clothing.</p>

<p><strong>Sprays:</strong> Most deodorant sprays come in aerosol containers. This type of deodorant goes on quickly and easily but tends to waste product by spraying beyond the targeted armpit and into the surrounding air. Aerosol deodorants can cause frostbite-like burns if held closer than six inches to the skin upon application. Although <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-aerosols-still-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aerosols no longer contain ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</a>, they do contribute to asthma-inducing smog and global warming. On the other hand, they leave little to no residue on clothing.</p>
<p><strong>Creams:</strong> These are less common and tend to be natural, aluminum-free products. Creams don’t need extra ingredients to solidify them so the whipped consistency is more concentrated in fragrance than stick deodorants. Creams are  applied with your fingers and are more messy and less convenient than other forms.</p>
<p>When applying the various forms of deodorants, the most noticeable differences are whether it feels wet when you first put it on, how long it takes to dry and your own tolerance for this sensation. If you don’t like the wetness of roll-on liquids, gels or sprays, you’ll probably be better off with a solid.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid residue, you may prefer a roll-on, gel or spray. Individuals seeking the purest, most natural ingredients may want to explore creams.</p>
<p>Finally, note that clinical-strength products instruct application only at bedtime, and not immediately after showering, which might take some adjustment if you’re f used to applying deodorant at your convenience. The bedtime application is recommended, because as body temperatures cool at night, people sweat less. This allows the product to properly soak in overnight. The antiperspirant benefits of these products don’t wash off as quickly as the deodorant components do when you’re showering.</p>
<p><b>Longevity: </b>The length of time that a deodorant provides effective odor and wetness control might be an another important factor to consider. The longevity of each product will vary significantly based on the individual, activity level, timing of bathing, the weather and more.</p>
<p><b>Residue: </b>We all know how annoying it is to find white deodorant streaks on our dark clothing. Some deodorants also leave residue on lighter colored fabrics, and antiperspirants are often blamed for leaving yellowish marks on clothing over time. Certain common antiperspirants, such as aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY, react with sweat and cause such yellowing.</p>
<p><b>Cost: </b>Deodorant prices range significantly, from under $5 to over $25. Because it is a product that you’ll purchase regularly, cost may be a factor when making your decision. Be sure to look at the net weight of product contained when price shopping; some of the containers are significantly larger than others. Also, consider product waste when using aerosol sprays. Although they contain more product than other deodorants by net weight, you lose some to the surrounding air when applying.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our 17 finalists were put to the test under a variety of conditions over a period of several weeks. During the testing period, the weather was pleasantly mild — typically in the low- to mid-60s during the day, and lower 50s at night.</p>
<h3>Odor</h3>
<p>Underarm odor was evaluated on a rating system of one (smells bad) to 10 (smells good). Scores were assigned at 3 different stages: initial scent upon application, over time (8 hours later) and after sweating under standardized conditions (always the same workout). These 3 scores were then averaged to create an overall odor control rating.</p>
<p>Our top performers that kept us smelling nice were antiperspirant deodorants <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006V7Y8Y/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Donna Karan &#8211; Cashmere Mist</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a>.</p>
<h3>Wetness</h3>
<p>Underarm moisture was evaluated on a similar rating system of one (wet) to 10 (dry). Scores were assigned at the same 3 stages as above: initial wetness upon application, over time (8 hours later) and after sweating under standardized conditions (always the same workout). Similarly, these 3 scores were then averaged to create an overall wetness control rating.</p>
<p>Our top performers for keeping sweaty underarms dry were antiperspirant deodorants <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/BT00KRV6RU/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Outlast Invisible Solid</a>.</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>We evaluated deodorant application on a scale of one (poor) to 10 (excellent). This included comfort of the applicator shape, product smoothness, wetness of product upon application and any application-related restrictions. Of note, clinical strength deodorants had several restrictions: use before bedtime, apply only two clicks and don’t use immediately after showering.</p>
<p>This process resulted in our top choices for comfortable application being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GY2B6NS/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dove &#8211; Advanced Care</a>.</p>
<h3>Residue</h3>
<p>We tested all products for noticeable clothing residue by placing a couple of swipes or sprays on both white and black t-shirt fabric. We then examined these to see if any obvious residue remained, such as yellow on white or white on dark. In general, all roll-ons, gels and sprays left the least amount of noticeable residue.</p>
<p>Antiperspirant deodorants all left some residue and were about the same for each one. The softer, clinical-strength solids left the most residue when placed directly on fabric, but our tester noted that this consistency could easily be rubbed in upon actual skin application. A couple of the natural deodorants left significant, chunky residue, which our tester also noticed sticking to her underarms and clothing throughout the day.</p>

<p>Our top choice of antiperspirant deodorant, as well as our selection for best deodorant for women overall, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a>. This product combines a strong, sweat-stopping antiperspirant with a pleasantly scented deodorant, providing both excellent moisture and odor control throughout the day. We love the silky texture, well-designed applicator and relatively low cost. While Degree is a good option for all women, it is a particularly great choice for women with active lifestyles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree</a> swipes on very smoothly with a nicely shaped solid stick applicator and perfect consistency of product texture — soft enough to go on without any trouble or discomfort, but firm enough to not disintegrate into excessive residue that leaves a mess on your clothing. With a net weight of 2.6 ounces (74 grams), Degree has a pleasant bottle shape and a comfortable grip.</p>
<p>We tried the Sexy Intrigue scent, which blends jasmine, rose, amber and vanilla, achieving a light, feminine, seductive result. The Degree MotionSense product line also comes in a variety of other appealing fragrances that includes Fresh Energy, Shower Clean and Daisy Fresh.</p>

<p>Degree offers excellent odor- and wetness- control and performs well even under heavy sweating conditions. This is likely due to the active ingredient aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY, which is notable at 19.2 percent. This is only 0.8 percent less than the clinical-strength deodorants we tested that had this same ingredient. In other words, you are receiving nearly the same antiperspirant protection that clinical-strength deodorants offer for less than half the price.</p>
<p>Also, unlike clinical strength deodorants, there are no restrictions to when and how much to apply, or how often you can use it. Degree can be applied liberally or reapplied any time you need extra protection, such as before hitting the gym or after showering.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree</a> may be particularly helpful for active individuals. The company explains that their MotionSense technology involves unique microcapsules that sit on the surface of your skin. When friction from movement breaks these up, additional fragrance is released. In other words, the more you move, the more it protects you from unpleasant body odor.</p>
<p>In terms of cost, Degree is one of the most reasonably priced products of all 17 finalists.</p>
<p>While a couple of our other antiperspirant deodorant finalists, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006V7Y8Y/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Donna Karan &#8211; Cashmere Mist</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/BT00KRV6RU/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Outlast Invisible Solid</a>, were also strong competitors, Degree &#8211; MotionSense was outstanding overall in its odor- and wetness-control, smooth texture, comfortable applicator and nice fragrance.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Degree &#8211; MotionSense provides excellent odor and wetness protection.</li>
<li>This product performs well for both daily living situations and for strenuous exercise.</li>
<li>Degree contains the highest level of active antiperspirant ingredient, aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY (19.2 percent), of the non-clinical-strength deodorants we tested.</li>
<li>We love the Sexy Intrigue fragrance, but there are several other options to try!</li>

<p>We’re not convinced that clinical-strength deodorants are worth the extra cost and application hassle for their slight advantage in antiperspirant protection. However, if you struggle with excessive perspiration, you may appreciate that advantage. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BEUPVXQ/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Clinical Strength Soft Solid</a> performed well in both the odor and wetness control categories. It also has a nice floral scent and the smoothest applicator of all clinical-strength products we tested.</p>
<p>Although clinical-strength products are fairly comfortable to apply, application directions are too restrictive for little, if any, performance benefit. Instructions require bedtime application, not applying directly after a shower and using a mere two clicks of product. Also, the softer style solid generally felt wetter initially than a traditional solid, which we didn’t care for.</p>
<p>The product directions for Secret &#8211; Clinical Strength Soft Solid state to apply two clicks of product to underarms at bedtime, which is funneled out through slits across the top of the deodorant stick. This was also the case with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CHJUJTO/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; Women Clinical Protection</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008VT05JS/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dove &#8211; Clinical Protection</a>, though the shape of the openings on Secret helped the product go on a little more evenly.</p>

<p>Secret&#8217;s fragrance, Clean Lavender, is light and pleasant. However, upon showering the next morning, the deodorant portion of the product washed off. That said, no particularly bad odor was noted that day, and wetness was well controlled even during a workout.</p>
<p>The active ingredient in Secret is aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex GLY (20.0 percent), which is similar to the active ingredient aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GYL (20.0 percent ) in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CHJUJTO/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; Clinical Strength</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008VT05JS/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dove &#8211; Clinical Strength</a>.</p>
<p>Both of these active ingredients, along with all aluminum compounds found in antiperspirants, are regulated by the FDA. Twenty percent of both aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex GYL and aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GYL is the maximum allowable amount for over-the-counter sale. Without a prescription, you will not find a stronger antiperspirant.</p>
<p>Not only are these ingredients effective for underarm moisture control, they have also been shown to cause less skin irritation than other aluminum-based antiperspirants like aluminum chloride and aluminum chlorohydrate.</p>
<p>Although it is the most expensive of the four clinical strength options tested, it is also the largest container, with a net weight of 2.6 ounces (73 grams).</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The product provides effective odor and wetness control, though the deodorant scent may be washed off sooner than you’d like, depending on when you shower.</li>
<li>As with all clinical-strength deodorants, a very small amount of Secret should be applied at bedtime only.</li>
<li>Secret &#8211; Clinical Strength is more expensive than other options, but you get more deodorant.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our foray into natural deodorant product testing had us feeling a little dubious, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RSVP6PS/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Native</a> quickly caught our attention as being vastly superior to other natural deodorant products. Its sweet, tropical scent and smooth consistency stood out among deodorants, particularly within this category. Native is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to avoid aluminum-based antiperspirants and still maintain effective deodorant protection.</p>
<p>First of all, we noted that it has a significant following online, with over 3,000 highly favorable reviews for each scent offered at Target. Native is free of aluminum, dyes, parabens, sulfates, and the company never experiments on animals.</p>
<p>Native excelled at smoothness of application. The texture felt surprisingly similar to our favorite deodorant overall, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a>. Other natural deodorants were either too chunky, too hard or too wet. Native, on the other hand, was just right.</p>

<p>We really liked the sweet, tropical Coconut &amp; Vanilla scent, but a few other fragrances are also appealing, such as Lavender &amp; Rose, Eucalyptus &amp; Mint and Jasmine &amp; Cedar. Relative to other natural deodorants tested, Native did a decent job of protecting against body odors throughout the day. Unfortunately, it didn’t hold up too well to a vigorous workout and was in large part just sweated off.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the best natural ways to stay smelling nice is to shower regularly. Check out our reviews for the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-shower-head/">best shower head</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019QYK8WK/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense Dry Spray</a> is packaged in a well-designed bottle, offers a fun, sporty scent and provides good wetness and odor protection. If you’re a fan of aerosols, you might want to give it a try.</p>
<p>While we wouldn’t say it goes on instantly dry as indicated, it didn’t seem any wetter than most typical solid sticks and dried quickly. Although Degree &#8211; Dry Spray certainly protected against odor and moisture, it generally wasn&#8217;t as effective under sweat-inducing conditions as solid antiperspirant deodorants. This was true of the other spray products we tested. Degree claims a 48-hour antiperspirant, but we needed to re-apply it after working out.</p>
<p>Degree &#8211; Dry Spray&#8217;s bottle is easy to grip, but unlike most deodorants, it doesn’t have a pop-off top. Instead, the sprayer has a built-in lock feature that can be used, for example, when traveling. Generally, we found the quicker access of the capless style to be convenient and, one less thing to lose!</p>

You’ll enjoy its sporty Active Shield fragrance as you hit your daily workout!</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019QYK8WK/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Degree sprays on smoothly and evenly. However, when our tester followed its labeling instructions and sprayed it six inches from her skin, a fair amount of product sprayed the surrounding air space, just as the other sprays did.</p>
<p>One major benefit of a spray deodorant is that they leave less noticeable residue on either dark or white clothing. This was the case with all four spray products tested, and they were all comparable on the small amount of residue left behind.</p>
<p>The active ingredient in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019QYK8WK/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense Dry Spray</a> is aluminum chlorohydrate (23.3 percent), a common ingredient in antiperspirants that has been used for decades. Aluminum in this form can be irritating to the skin, cause acne and aggravate <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-safety-razor/">razor</a> burn in some individuals. Fortunately, we didn’t notice any issues and were comforted that the FDA considers aluminum chlorohydrate to be safe in concentrations up to 25 percent.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Degree &#8211; MotionSense Dry Spray offers good odor and wetness control under most conditions.</li>
<li>It sprays evenly and leaves little noticeable residue on clothing.</li>
<li>The bottle style is easy to grip, and its built-in lock feature is convenient when you&#8217;re traveling.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Donna Karan &#8211; Cashmere Mist</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006V7Y8Y/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Donna Karan &#8211; Cashmere Mist</a> smells heavenly and scored top marks for initial scent. It offers the perfect combination of cleanliness and sexy femininity, with just a hint of baby-powder undertones. It is effective as both an antiperspirant and deodorant, standing up well to both daily use and rigorous workouts.</p>
<p>However, it loses points in applicator comfort. The small, round shape isn’t terrible, but our tester definitely preferred the wider, more traditional shape of the other solids. Also, the cap is a twist-off style, as opposed to pop-off, which we found somewhat less convenient.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback is its price tag; it&#8217;s more than six times the cost of our favorite antiperspirant deodorant, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a>. While we find it a stretch to justify the expense, if you&#8217;re willing to shell out some big bucks, you will no doubt smell fantastic. Think of it as an antiperspirant deodorant combined with your favorite perfume.</p>
<p><b>Secret &#8211; Outlast Invisible Solid</b></p>
<p>We found that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/BT00KRV6RU/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Outlast Invisible Solid</a> also did an excellent job for both odor and wetness control and held up well to the workout. It is comfortable and smooth to put on, and the scent —  Completely Clean — smells fresh and, well, clean. Secret’s active ingredient is aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY (19 percent), which offers nearly the same antiperspirant protection for wetness control as our overall winner, Degree &#8211; MotionSense.</p>
<p>Although we slightly preferred the fragrance, texture and bottle style of Degree, Secret is a strong competitor for best antiperspirant deodorant and a smart choice for your daily antiperspirant-deodorant needs.</p>
<p><b>Dove &#8211; Advanced Care</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GY2B6NS/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dove &#8211; Advanced Care</a> did the job decently enough, but nothing particularly stood out during testing other than its lovely, smooth texture. The fragrance we tried, Revive, was subtly fruity and perfectly pleasant. The product line also offers additional scents, such as Beauty Finish and Cool Essentials. Its NutriumMoisture technology is advertised to moisturize your underarms for softer skin in just three days, but we didn’t notice any difference,</p>
<p><b>Secret &#8211; Fresh Clear Gel</b></p>
<p>A reasonably effective option for anyone who dislikes any type of white deodorant residue on their clothing is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V5DH4ZA/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Fresh Clear Gel</a>, which performed very well and left no visible residue on fabric. The applicator has a nice shape, and the product went on smoothly, although the gel initially felt cold and wet on the skin. The scent we tried, Boho Berry, was appropriately fruity.</p>
<p>This product didn’t hold up quite as well as the other antiperspirant deodorants in terms of odor and wetness protection. This may be because it uses a slightly different active ingredient, aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrex GLY (16 percent).</p>

<p><b>Degree &#8211; Women Clinical Protection</b></p>
<p>This deodorant has a nice, light scent — Shower Clean — and performed well overall on odor and wetness testing. It did leave quite a bit of residue on the materials test, but because of the soft consistency of the product, this didn’t seem like a major problem. When it came to actual wear on the skin, we didn’t notice any particularly alarming level of residue on our clothing.</p>
<p>Like our top deodorant contender, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a>, this product uses MotionSense technology: aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY, but with 20.0 percent instead of 19.2 percent. That doesn’t seem like much of a difference to justify paying nearly twice as much for a smaller amount (1.7 ounces vs. 2.6 ounces).</p>
<p><b>Dove &#8211; Clinical Protection</b></p>
<p>We almost couldn’t tell any difference between <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008VT05JS/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dove &#8211; Clinical Protection</a> and Degree &#8211; Women Clinical Protection. The applicator, consistency, packaging, ingredients and effectiveness of the product are virtually identical. Even the scent of Dove — Soothing Chamomile — smells similarly light and floral. One quarter of this product is composed of moisturizers to improve the feel of your underarm skin.</p>
<p>As with Degree &#8211; Women Clinical Protection, we felt that the slight antiperspirant protection benefit that one may receive from using Dove &#8211; Clinical Protection over a standard antiperspirant deodorant did not justify the significantly higher cost.</p>
<p><b>Certain DRI &#8211; Prescription Strength Clinical</b></p>
<p>The only roll-on of the clinical-strength deodorants tested, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JB1MUNI/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Certain DRI &#8211; Prescription Strength Clinical</a>, goes on wet and once dry, provides moderately effective wetness control. Unlike the other 16 products we evaluated, Certain DRI is unscented. If you have skin sensitivities to fragrances or want to wear perfumes alongside an antiperspirant, this might be a good option for you.</p>
<p>We did prefer, however, the deodorant component of the other clinical-strength products we tested, because upon bedtime application and until the next morning’s shower, they gave off a pleasant, floral scent. On the plus side, Certain DRI&#8217;s clear liquid left no residue on fabric.</p>

<h4><b>Green Tidings &#8211; All Natural</b><b>  </b></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EOB0042/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Green Tidings &#8211; All Natural</a> has a pasty, almost chunky consistency. It performed better than the other natural products in terms of odor control, but it didn’t last throughout the day. The Green Tidings applicator is small and round and generally not as comfortable as a traditionally oval-shaped solid. This deodorant felt gooey and left reside on both black and white material.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the fragrance is different than other deodorants: it has  a strong lavender scent like you might find in a scented candle. Its main ingredients are recognizable &#8212; tapioca starch, coconut oil and baking soda &#8212; and it&#8217;s non-toxic, vegan and free of gluten, aluminum, paraben and artificial fragrance. The company also offers a 100-percent satisfaction guarantee or a full refund.</p>
<h4><b>Schmidt’s &#8211; Natural</b></h4>
<p>The beautiful packaging and lovely scent options of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018K3ATKE/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Schmidt’s &#8211; Natural</a> made us really want to like it, but the stick was so hard and rough that it actually hurt to apply. It left the most residue — yellowish in color —  of all 17 deodorants we tested. Schmidt&#8217;s also wasn&#8217;t effective at controlling wetness and odor.</p>
<p>It does have a nice scent, however; we particularly liked the Bergamot &amp; Lime fragrance. Schmidt&#8217;s is quite similar to Native &#8211; Women, but is less effective and far more painful to apply.</p>
<p><b>Bali Secrets &#8211; Natural</b></p>
<p>Despite favorable online reviews, we’re having trouble seeing the point of wearing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012E9DMNQ/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bali Secrets &#8211; Natural</a> at all. First off, it was our least favorite scent of all 17 finalists — in fact, we disliked the smell of Original Essence so viscerally that we’d rather go deodorant-free. The harsh scent reminded us more of a cleaning product.</p>
<p>Next, the roll-on style goes on very wet and not as smoothly as you might expect. Its gritty consistency jammed up the small applicator and made easy application challenging. Any benefits it may have had for controlling odor and wetness soon wore off, and we felt sticky the entire time wearing it.</p>
<p>Bali Secrets is probably good for the planet — it&#8217;s made from seaweed extract and mineral salt — but that seems to be the only thing it’s good for.</p>

<p><b>Secret &#8211; Original</b></p>
<p>If you’re a fan of baby powder, you’ll enjoy the scent of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BY2TF9Y/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Original</a>. While we didn’t love the spray mechanism of this particular aerosol product, Secret was fairly effective in controlling odor and wetness throughout the day — probably as a result of the highest active ingredient level of all our sprays, aluminum chlorohydrate (24 percent). Like the other sprays, it goes on really wet, leaves very little in the way of residue and scents the air surrounding your armpit.</p>
<p><b>Dove &#8211; Dry Spray</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OIUBDLI/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dove &#8211; Dry Spray</a> also sprays on wet but dries quickly. We liked its light scent and sleek bottle design, but overall it just didn&#8217;t hold up as well, particularly after a heavy workout. The active ingredient is aluminum chlorohydrate (20.2 percent), which is a fair amount less than the more effective spray deodorants and was probably the reason we felt more sweaty.</p>
<p><b>Suave &#8211; 24 Hour Protection</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J5K4CJQ/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suave &#8211; 24 Hour Protection</a> is another product that smells like baby powder. It didn’t spray on evenly, wasted a lot to the surrounding air and was only somewhat effective at odor and wetness control. Suave’s active ingredient is also aluminum chlorohydrate (19.1 percent), likely leading to less-effective antiperspirant control.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After weeks of immersing ourselves in the world of women’s deodorant, we&#8217;re confident that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KG4JG2P/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense</a> antiperspirant deodorant will provide excellent odor and wetness control during both daily life and sweaty exercise routines. Its light and sexy scent, smooth texture, comfortable shape and relatively high concentrate of active ingredient make this product our selection for both best antiperspirant deodorant and best deodorant overall for women.</p>
<p>If you perspire especially heavily and  are more concerned with the antiperspirant component of a deodorant product, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BEUPVXQ/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret &#8211; Clinical Strength Soft Solid</a> might be the way to go. Keep in mind that there are some application restrictions that may require changing up some long-time habits.</p>
<p>If you’d like to stick with all-natural ingredients and avoid aluminum-containing antiperspirants, try <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PGD49QV/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Native</a> natural deodorant. It’s fun, tropical scent will go a long way towards masking unpleasant body odors, and the smooth texture is one of our favorites to apply.</p>
<p>For those who prefer a spray deodorant, we found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019QYK8WK/?tag=ybddeo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Degree &#8211; MotionSense Dry Spray</a> a good option. It provides good odor and wetness control under most circumstances and is packaged in a nicely designed dispenser.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter miles of walking and running and hours of standing in place, we’ve determined that the best insoles are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN</a>. Recommended by the <span style="font-weight: 400;">American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA)</span>, these shoe insoles provide great support for the entire foot, including the troublesome heel and arch areas. They are appropriate for a wide range of activities and slip easily into a variety of shoe styles. Our runner-up selection is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U</a>, a well-cushioned alternative that offers excellent stability.</p>

<p>We began our research by exploring recommendations by medical experts, including podiatrists and physical therapists. First, we learned that the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) recognizes products, including insoles, that are found to be beneficial to foot health with a <a href="https://www.apma.org/Patients/content.cfm?ItemNumber=1108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seal of Acceptance</a>. Five of our six insole finalists have received this endorsement; the sixth received excellent user reviews at an economical price point.</p>
<p>Next, we contacted an experienced podiatrist, Dr. Benjamin Cullen of <a href="https://www.sandiegopodiatrygroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Diego Podiatry Group</a>, for his opinion on the best insole. Dr. Cullen explained that for an average person with mild heel pain, a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN insoles</a> often resolves any issues. He suggests this type both for active exercisers and for people who are on their feet for long periods of time. These insoles, Dr. Cullen says, provide enough support for most individuals without being too rigid.</p>
<p>In general, Dr. Cullen recommends breaking in new shoe insoles first before wearing them for a full day. This involves wearing them for 1-2 hours per day and gradually increasing the time worn over several days. Most manufacturers of the insoles we chose make this same recommendation, particularly if you aren’t used to wearing shoe insoles or orthotics.</p>
<p><strong>Note that while insoles are heavily marketed for a range of different activities (from “running” to “work”), our podiatrist suggests that it is not necessary to have different insoles for each activity.</strong></p>
<p>We also discussed the benefits of using insoles with exercise enthusiast and physical therapist, <a href="https://www.uchealth.org/provider/christine-kittles-pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine Kittles</a>. She explained that putting your feet into proper alignment can relieve pain in your feet and lower body, plus improve overall mobility. Kittles has seen positive results with all types of Superfeet insoles, which mold to the shape of your feet over time.</p>
<p>Finally, we researched previous product testing by The Wirecutter, along with a variety of articles, expert advice and product information online from sources like Runner’s World, Orthotic Shop, REI Expert Advice and The Insole Store.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs an insole?</h2>
<p>Almost everyone who puts stress on their feet can benefit from a pair of quality insoles. This stress may come from high-impact physical activity such as running, fitness walking and intensive training. Or, it can come from long hours of standing on your feet in professions like nursing, food service or retail. If you stand in the same spot all day, consider using an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-anti-fatigue-mat/" rel="noopener">anti-fatigue mat</a> too.</p>
<p>Whether you are currently experiencing foot, ankle, knee, hip or lower back pain, or simply want to avoid it in the future, a good pair of insoles may help. For the majority of people, putting feet into a neutral position — which is what most shoe insoles aim to do — helps solve and prevent related pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>Foot pain can be due to <a href="https://www.apma.org/Patients/FootHealth.cfm?ItemNumber=985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plantar fasciitis</a>, flat feet, high arches, heel pain, <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a20795259/pronation-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overpronation</a> or repetitive stress. If you have a proper insole already and are still experiencing foot pain from repetitive stress, using a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/foot-massagers/">foot massager</a> may help relieve some pain. Shoe insoles provide both cushioning and overall support, thereby relieving pain not only in your feet, but often in other areas of your lower body as well. Shoe insoles can also help prevent blisters and even keep your feet warm.</p>
<p>Choosing a pair to try may seem overwhelming. As previously mentioned, insoles are marketed for many types of activities, such as standing all day, walking, running and hiking. Our experts, however, suggest that there are only two main types of insoles — support insoles and gel/cushioned ones.</p>
<p>Most people can benefit from better support, but some individuals may simply need extra padding. Although our testing focused on full-length support-style insoles (which generally provide the maximum level of support and, ultimately, comfort) the final six selections offer a range of cushioning levels.</p>
<p>Insoles can be used in various types of shoes, including athletic, casual, dress and work. Generally, they are meant to replace (as opposed to go on top of) the original shoe insoles.</p>
<p>Full-length insoles tend to be designed for sturdier, roomier athletic shoes, so there are certain styles of shoes that insoles won’t work for. This can be an issue particularly affecting women’s styles: sandals, high heels and very tight-fitting shoes. In these cases, other types of partial inserts/lifts/pads may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>If your shoes do not have removable insoles to start with, getting a pair of insoles to fit could be challenging.</p>
<p>When it comes to insoles, sometimes the “best” pair depends on the actual shape of your foot, any problems you are having and what activity you are doing.</p>
<p>Women, for example, tend to have issues with forefoot pain from wearing high heels; good arch padding can help divert the pressure from that area. Runners, on the other hand, often experience heel pain, so a deep, stable heel cup could help.</p>
<p>Our feet come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. As you explore the many insoles on the market, it is helpful to understand your foot type. Are you flat-footed or do you have unusually high arches? Take this test to find out. Are your feet wide or narrow? Do you over- or under-pronate? Finally, are you currently experiencing any pain? If you are having severe foot, ankle, knee, hip or back pain, consult your doctor before starting your search.</p>
<p>If chronic health problems, such as diabetes or circulation issues, are contributing factors to your foot, ankle or lower body pain, please consult your medical provider. Custom orthotics and/or additional treatment may be needed.</p>
<p>One important aspect that our testers noticed was that every single pair of insoles tested was a major improvement over the thin, floppy, formless insoles that come standard in shoes. Bottom line? Give shoe insoles a try! Your feet don’t need to hurt.</p>
<h2 id="store">Store-bought insoles vs prescription orthotics</h2>
<p>There are many reasons to try over-the-counter shoe insoles before rushing to the podiatrist for custom orthotics. The biggest reason, of course, is financial. The average cost of prescription orthotics is $400-600. Because this isn’t generally covered by insurance, podiatrists and physical therapists often suggest trying over-the-counter shoe insoles first, since they are generally priced at $10-100.</p>
<p>When making your decision, consider that because custom orthotics are costly, most people only purchase one pair and transfer them between various shoes. This isn’t as convenient as owning multiple pairs for all of your shoes. If store-bought insoles prove effective for you, their more affordable price point may allow you to purchase multiple pairs for this convenience.</p>
<p>Next, note that custom orthotics can also be more of a hassle to obtain, often requiring a referral from a primary care doctor to a podiatrist or orthopedic specialist. This can cause delays in treating foot discomfort. Quality over-the-counter insoles can be conveniently purchased at many stores selling footwear or online from various outlets.</p>
<p>Custom orthotics are customized to your feet, either to correct certain motions or to accommodate specific problems and relieve related pain. They can also be customized to particular shoes, including high heels.</p>
<p>Also, custom orthotics are made from top-quality materials and can last one to five years, depending on a variety of factors. Your podiatrist can help determine when it’s time to replace them. Store-bought insoles tend to wear out faster, though there is a wide range of durability between products. Superfeet, for example, can last up to a full year.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing any active foot pain, Dr. Cullen recommends giving it some time to resolve once you start wearing your new shoe insoles. After the initial break-in period of several days, wear them full-time for an additional two to four weeks. If there’s no improvement in your pain at that point, you may need custom orthotics.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are in doubt as to whether you should try over-the-counter or prescription orthotics, and/or your foot-related pain is severe, please consult your medical provider.</p>

<p><strong>Overall support:</strong> For proper foot health, good support is key. In our testing, we generally found that the more rigid pairs of insoles, particularly in the arch and heel areas, provided the best overall support. Again, a supportive pair of insoles will place the foot in a neutral position, minimizing foot pain and discomfort and/or avoiding future issues with these.</p>
<p><strong>Overall comfort:</strong> Comfort is also very important. The whole point of insoles, after all, is to make your feet happy! Of course, this measure is more subjective than others, since it depends on the needs of your feet, but the majority of our testers found Superfeet the most comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Arch support:</strong> Many individuals seeking insoles mention arch pain as a motivating factor. The arch area should be shaped appropriately for your foot and be strong enough to not collapse under your weight. Those with very flat feet may not find very high arch support as comfortable as those with naturally higher arches, but the exact shape of the arch curve can factor in as well.</p>
<p>Appropriate arch support can help divert pain from other areas, such as the forefoot or heel areas, so it is beneficial for the entire foot. We found that Superfeet offered a nicely shaped, moderate arch curve with strong support that did not collapse under weight. The SOLE, Powerstep, and Physix models had the highest arches; Spenco the most mild.</p>
<p><strong>Heel cup:</strong> The heel is another area of the foot where many people experience pain. Some insoles offer a cradling effect for the heel which can improve stability and comfort. Consider the width and depth of the heel cradle (if any) and how it fits your particular foot. We found that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE</a> offered the most stable heel support.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/superfeet-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/superfeet-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/superfeet-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/superfeet-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/superfeet-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/superfeet-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/superfeet-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/superfeet-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/superfeet-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best overall: Superfeet - GREEN</h3><p>The Superfeet offered the best support of all the insoles we tested, with the most support in the heel area.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>Cushioning:</strong> The level of padding varies significantly from insole to insole. Some offer a fairly uniform cushion while others focus the padding onto certain areas of the foot. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco</a> insoles were by far the most cushioned of the ones we tested.</p>
<p><strong>Thickness:</strong> Shoe insoles are designed to replace the ones that come standard with a pair of shoes. Shoes with removable insoles are generally higher-volume, with some flexible space to accommodate a slightly larger insole. However, if you need to fit the insoles into a greater variety of shoes, look for a thinner design.</p>
<p><strong>Material:</strong> All of the insoles we tested are made from synthetic materials, primarily foam and plastics. However, there are shoe insoles on the market made from leather and natural materials.</p>
<p><strong>Odor and moisture control:</strong> Although we didn’t notice any particular odor or moisture issues with any of the insoles tested, we can certainly imagine this could become an issue over time. To avoid, remove the insoles entirely from the shoe after heavy use and let them air out overnight. Many insoles can be hand washed, but check care instructions for specifics.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Running-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We recruited two product testers, one male and one female, to spend some time wearing our six finalists. Both testers either walked or ran a regular route multiple times per week; both also spent a fair amount of time standing in place. Insole tests were conducted after an initial 3-day break-in period, as recommended by our medical experts and manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<h3>Comfort ratings</h3>
<p>The first product test assigned comfort ratings —scale of one (poor) to 10 (excellent) — for each insole after being placed into a pair of athletic shoes. Each model was rated 1) after first putting them on, 2) after an hour of brisk walking and/or running, and 3) after an hour of standing. Care was taken to ensure comparable conditions such as speed, time of day, type of socks and length of route.</p>
<p>These tests were repeated for all of our insole finalists to ensure an accurate and consistent assessment. We then averaged all individual comfort scores to create an overall comfort score for each finalist. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a> insoles received the highest overall comfort ratings.</p>
<h3>Padding inspection</h3>
<p>Next, a visual and touch inspection on padding was completed. This took note of padding levels in the following areas: overall, heel, arch, toe and metatarsal. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco</a> insoles offered the best overall padding and cushioning. SOLE and Powerstep also performed well.</p>
<h3>Shoe fit</h3>
<p>We placed the insoles into a variety of shoes to check fit: experimenting with men’s and women’s hiking shoes, running shoes, fashion sneakers, dress shoes and boots. It quickly became clear which insole was more difficult to put in, take out and move into another shoe.</p>
<p>For anyone wanting to transfer their insoles between shoes regularly, the flexible, floppy style of the Spenco insoles made them the most challenging to maneuver; the SOLE ones were next most challenging due to their slightly larger size, though we found the others fairly comparable.</p>
<p>This stage of testing was also designed to reveal which, if any, insoles slipped around within the shoe. We found that they all stayed in place quite well. We also discovered which ones were more likely to fit in lower-volume shoes.The thinner forefoot area of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GSPH61/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physix</a> made them the lowest profile insoles and most likely to fit into tighter dress shoes and boots or low-volume fashion sneakers.</p>
<h3>Stability measurements</h3>
<h4>Heel cup</h4>
<p>Heel pain is a big problem for many individuals and a major component of why people turn to insoles in the first place. Therefore, a key point of marketing for shoe insoles involves claims of a “deep heel cup.”</p>
<p>To attach some relative meaning to this claim, we investigated by assigning each insole one of three categories: strong, moderate or mild. Two of the insoles landed in the “strong” category and offered the best cradling of the heel area — the Superfeet and SOLE.</p>
<h4>Arch height</h4>
<p>Insole arches were compared to each other and rated high, moderate or mild. SOLE and Powerstep had the highest arches and strong arch support — but note that the arch curve could be too high for some individuals. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GSPH61/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physix</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058YGR8W/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vionic</a> offered more moderate arch support; Spenco was the lowest.</p>
<h4>Rigidity of insole</h4>
<p>When it comes to insoles, there must be a balance of being rigid enough to offer good support while still flexible enough for the feet to comfortably bend and move. We rated each insole model in one of three categories: flexible, rigid or semi-rigid. Our top choice, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a>, and runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE</a>, both landed in the “rigid” category, although note that while the heel and arch areas are fairly rigid, both are still flexible in the forefoot area.</p>
<h3>Customization</h3>
<p>Most shoe insoles are designed to custom-mold to your foot over time. None of the insoles we tested require heat molding, though the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE</a> model offered the option to heat mold, a simple process involving an oven at low heat before wearing to speed up the customization process.</p>
<p>With either heat or wear molding, our manufacturers’ recommendations consistently suggested breaking in new insoles over a several-day period, slowly increasing the time worn each day. We noticed that the Superfeet insoles showed visible shape changes as they molded to our feet.</p>
<h3>Odor and moisture</h3>
<p>We planned to take note of any unusual odor or moisture after wearing, but all insole models that we tested provided effective odor and moisture control.</p>
<h2 id="best">The best insole overall: Superfeet &#8211; GREEN</h2>

<p>After extensive online research to narrow down the field to six finalists, we conducted a variety of product tests that had us running for miles, walking briskly, standing in place and pulling out a variety of shoe styles from our closets. We explored insole support, stability, comfort, cushioning, shoe fit — and even potential issues with bad odors (yikes!). In the end, our feet are extremely grateful and the winner of best insole overall is abundantly clear: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN</a>.</p>
<p>This product comes highly endorsed by medical experts. Along with our runner-up, SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U, this one has received the APMA Seal of Acceptance — a distinction demonstrating that podiatrists agree these insoles add significant value to overall foot health.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Superfeet insoles are recommended by our expert podiatrist, Dr. Cullen, for the vast majority of people with mild foot pain. They are appropriate for high-impact activities, long periods of standing, and general daily wear. Dr. Cullen generally suggests that patients give these a try before spending hundreds of dollars on custom orthotics; however, if active foot pain has not improved within two to four weeks, custom orthotics may be necessary.</p>
<p>Exercise enthusiast and physical therapist Christine Kittles agrees that Superfeet makes the best insoles. She uses them personally and recommends them to help resolve or avoid both foot and lower body pain — thereby improving an individual’s overall mobility. Over time, Superfeet insoles visibly mold to your foot to provide a higher level of customization than many other store-bought insoles.</p>

<p>Superfeet insoles are highly reviewed by a number of product sites that we know and trust, including <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-insoles-for-running-and-walking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wirecutter</a>, <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20790036/a-guide-to-running-shoe-inserts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runner’s World</a>, <a href="https://www.orthoticshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orthotic Shop</a>, <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/insoles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI Expert Advice</a> and <a href="https://www.theinsolestore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Insole Store</a>.</p>
<p>From our series of product tests, Superfeet &#8211; GREEN earned top comfort marks by all product testers, offering a combination of excellent arch and heel support. The arch support offers a moderate, nicely shaped curve that is appropriate for most foot types and a deep cradle provides excellent heel stability. SOLE also offers a nice heel cradle and good arch support, although the arches are a bit higher so they may not be appropriate for all foot shapes.</p>
<p>Superfeet has a fairly rigid structure to the heel and arch areas, similar to our runner-up, along with a flexible, moderately cushioned forefront. While SOLE offers more cushioning in the forefoot area, they are also higher-profile and thicker as a result, leading to more challenges with shoe fit. Superfeet allows for a nice trade-off between comfort and functionality.</p>
<p>The downside mostly comes with cost. Superfeet (and SOLE) are definitely on the pricier end of store-bought insoles. However, we believe that they will last much longer than less expensive options, which we could see visible wear and tear on after just a handful of wearings. Superfeet claims their insoles will last up to one year or 500 miles and they come with a 60-day satisfaction guarantee.</p>

<p>We also really like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SOLE-Softec-Ultra-U-Support-Inserts/dp/B01KT2XVLI/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U insoles</a>. Like Superfeet, they have the APMA Seal of Acceptance and performed well in all areas of our product testing. SOLE can be used for a variety of activities and work best in high-volume shoes.</p>
<p>SOLE performed especially well for overall support. The arch of the SOLE insoles provides high, fairly rigid support, making them a good option for individuals with high arches. Like all models tested, the forefoot area of the insole remains flexible. They have a very similar cradling heel cup to Superfeet &#8211; GREEN, which is part of their appeal and offers excellent heel support and stability.</p>
<p>For individuals with particularly high arches, SOLE is a good option. Even for those with more moderately arched feet, they might be still be comfortable due to the nicely shaped and cushioned arch curve. Alternatively, Superfeet offers more moderately raised arches.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole insole, the cushioning was noticeably thicker on SOLE than all the other finalists, with the exception of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco</a>. This especially stood out in the forefoot area where other insoles tend to run much thinner.</p>
<p>While the padding is certainly nice to have, there is a trade off because it makes the size of the insoles slightly larger than the others, including Superfeet. This makes shoe fit more challenging, although there is still room in high-volume shoes for these to be comfortable.</p>

<p>To speed up the customization process, or make future adjustments, SOLE also gives the option of heat molding — a simple process that can be done in your home oven. If that doesn’t appeal to you, they can also be molded just by wearing them.</p>
<p>The main drawbacks are that they are higher in price and that there may be some shoe fit issues since they are also thicker than some of the others, as a result of more cushioning. We also found that they run a little longer than some of the others, so may require trimming. (Superfeet also required some trimming.)</p>
<p>If you’re looking for good support that also offers good cushioning, and plan to use them in high-volume shoes, SOLE might be a good option. They are extremely comfortable, supportive and padded, earning them best runner-up choice.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GSPH61/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physix &#8211; Gear Sport Soles</a> offer an ultra-thin design, leaving lots of toe space and also making them a good choice for tighter fitting shoes. The trade-off is that the forefoot cushioning is quite mild. They have a moderately cradling heel cup and moderate/high arch support.</p>
<p>As one of the least expensive options, they are easy on the budget and come with a 100% money-back guarantee if you’re not satisfied. One area of concern is that they do not have the APMA Seal of Acceptance. However, they tested higher than some of the other insoles that do. Like all of our insole finalists, they are generally highly reviewed by previous customers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco &#8211; Polysorb Cross Trainer</a> is another budget-friendly option that is almost exclusively focused on cushioning and shock absorption, though there is also a soft, moderate arch support that is designed for low- to medium-arched feet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the foam under the metatarsal area already showed some signs of wear and tear after just a couple wearings, so the low price point suggests a trade off with long-term durability, but they also come with a one-year unconditional guarantee.</p>
<p>They are comfortable and cushioned and accepted by the APMA, but may not be right for everyone due to fewer stability features.</p>

<p>Designed by podiatrists, Powerstep offers a full range of insoles, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BVHS1Q/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Powerstep Pinnacle</a> being an “Amazon choice” and APMA-accepted. These have high firm and flexible arch support and a moderate/high cradling heel cup designed for mild to moderate pronation.</p>
<p>The heel is raised slightly higher than some of the other products, taking up somewhat more space in the shoe. The insole’s texture caused some friction for one of our testers on the bottom of the foot and the high heel cup caused heel blistering (due to shoe fit issues) for our other tester.</p>
<p>Powerstep offers a moderate amount of cushioning and is also priced in the middle of the range. Insoles come with a lifetime guarantee against breakage of the plastic foot support.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058YGR8W/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vionic &#8211; Orthaheel Active</a> insoles are designed by podiatrists and have a moderately sloped, fairly rigid arch support with mild overall cushioning and a moderately cradling heel cup. There is visible targeted padding in the metatarsal and heel strike areas.</p>
<p>Vionic offers a 30-day guarantee and has the APMA Seal of Acceptance. While there was nothing specific wrong with them, testers just generally didn’t find them as comfortable as the top choices.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We believe that our top-rated shoe insoles, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN</a>, will help you say goodbye to sore feet. These insoles scored well on all aspects of our product testing including overall comfort, arch and heel support, padding, rigidity, shoe fit and functionality — and were clear favorites among our product testers.</p>
<p>They are appropriate for all levels of activity. The combination of cradling heel support, well-shaped and rigid arches, and overall comfort made them winners for best insole.</p>
<p>Our runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SOLE-Softec-Ultra-U-Support-Inserts/dp/B01KT2XVLI/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U insoles</a>, is another great option for sore feet. This option is especially good for anyone looking for high, rigid arch support, along with good padding, for high-volume, athletic-style shoes.</p>
