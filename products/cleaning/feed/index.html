								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing six top designs for power, efficiency and easy handling, we chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F8DZQV/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; Elite</a> as the best canister vacuum. The unique multi-mode floor head switches quickly between carpets and bare floors, and the power and dust control on this model are competitive with popular dealer-sold vacuums going for double or triple the price. If you&#8217;re not sure about the long hose of a canister vacuum but want more flexibility than an upright, the bagless <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> has the best features from both types.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After testing <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuums</a>, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">upright vacuums</a>, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-car-vacuum/">car vacuums</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vacuums for pet hair</a>, we turned our attention to the prestigious category dominated by thousand-dollar European super-vacuums beloved by enthusiasts (and dealers, if not repair technicians) worldwide.</p>
<p>We thought long and hard about a budget for this review. We read all about Miele, Riccar, Sebo and other well-known makers who have canister vacuums that compete for shelf space at vacuum dealers. Miele is especially notable, since they consistently take top scores in publications like Consumer Reports and even the usually-budget-conscious Wirecutter. We also talked to vacuum dealers and watched them demonstrate these luxury vacuums and rave about their power, longevity and long-term value.</p>
<p>After our pet vacuum tester&#8217;s lackluster experience with his own Miele &#8211; Calima, though, we thought long and hard about how to qualify value for a general review. </p>
<p>Given how well our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">upright vacuum review</a> winners handle the same situations a canister excels in, we settled on a high-but-comparable $450 price maximum as a first criteria. This eliminated even the least-expensive Miele models with a power head, like the $700 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XHQJKKD/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Compact C2 Electro+</a>. Other high-end brands were even farther out of reach.</p>
<p>We think you should know these prestige brands are out there, and if you&#8217;re researching canister vacuums you&#8217;ve almost certainly heard people rave about them, but none of our team members could imagine spending $700 to $1200 on a vacuum given how good the less expensive brands have become.</p>
<p>Looking for results of vacuum tests that weren&#8217;t specifically dealer-sponsored advertisements, we quickly found that Kenmore is the only major seller of canister vacuums with filtration and carpet-cleaning features we&#8217;ve come to expect in this middle-tier price range.</p>
<p>We also looked at consumer satisfaction numbers from Consumer Reports and J.D. Power, along with retailer customer reviews and YouTube reviews, to pick three more competing designs that could fit into tighter budgets along with the mid-range Kenmore and Shark vacuums.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, a canister vacuum separates the motor and dust receptacle from the tools you hold with a long hose. Most of the weight of the vacuum is in the &#8220;canister&#8221; that follows you around on the floor, so you&#8217;re more free to move around and reach tight places.</p>
<p>Canister vacuums have the advantage in smaller rooms. The low-profile head of a canister vacuum’s pickup tool fits under furniture, and the lower weight makes tight corners less tiring. The drawbacks start when you have to move the canister body while you’re vacuuming.</p>
<p>An upright vacuum, by comparison, really shines if you need to clean up and down a carpeted hall or over a large open space. The cord is usually long enough that you can finish the job without unplugging, and you won’t have to drag a canister along behind you.</p>
<p>Canister vacuums are popular in Europe, and upright vacuums are overwhelmingly more popular among American homeowners. This shift probably comes down to a difference in floor plans, with spread-out wall-to-wall carpeting floorspace favoring uprights versus the bare floors and staircases of old-world architecture.</p>
<h3>Air vs. electric brushrolls</h3>
<p>For cleaning carpet, a spinning brush roller works much better than suction alone by agitating the carpet and sweeping up the dirt and hair as they bounce around. This is a defining trait of most upright vacuums, but you can get a brushroll head for many canister vacuums.</p>
<p>Canisters often come only with air-turbine-powered brushroll tools, though, which means that the flow of air spins a turbine that powers the brushroll. That&#8217;s better than no roller at all on low-pile carpet. However, we found when testing the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuums</a> against our writer&#8217;s own air-driven <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S1AGM30/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Miele &#8211; Calima</a> that even expensive turbine heads are poor at picking up hair, and they don&#8217;t have enough power to agitate long-pile carpet.</p>
<p>For this review, we tested two canister vacuums from Kenmore that use motorized brushrolls, and one turbine-powered system from Electrolux.</p>
<h3>A third way: Shark&#8217;s Lift-Away system</h3>
<p>Shark’s “Lift-Away” vacuum design tries to split the difference between a canister and an upright: When you want to separate the bulky motor housing from the floor tools you can just push a button and detach it. The hose is very short compared to a purpose-built canister system, but it has many of the same strengths when you need to vacuum under a bed or on carpeted stairs.</p>
<p>Note that among Shark models, only the more expensive &#8220;powered lift-away&#8221; models like the Apex can run the brushroll motor when the base is detached. We&#8217;ve tested the value-oriented Navigator in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">best upright vacuum review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuum review</a>, but we only compared the more versatile Apex against canister vacuums.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Appropriate floor tools:</b> If you only need to clean bare floors, the most basic sweeping heads will work quite well at picking up dirt. As soon as you need to work on carpet, though, an electric rotary-brush head helps shake out and capture more dirt.</p>
<p><b>Bagged vs. bagless system: </b>Most popular canister vacuums still use bags to capture dirt, despite upright vacuums switching almost entirely to bagless designs. Bags often capture fine dust better, and they can make it easier to dispose of what you&#8217;ve vacuumed up if you don&#8217;t have the option of stepping outside to empty it.</p>
<p><b>Hose length:</b> The length of a hose will determine how much area you can clean before you have to start dragging the motor around.</p>
<p><b>Retractable cord: </b>While the canister design means that you&#8217;ve always got a hose taking up space in the closet, a common convenience on these vacuums is a retractable power cord.</p>
<p><b>Height control:</b> On the plushest carpet, wheels that lift the brushroll head above the ends of the fibers will allow you to continue gliding smoothly even with strong suction power and strong agitation from a brushroll.</p>
<p><b>Onboard tool storage: </b>Specialized tools for detail cleaning are handy to have, but if there&#8217;s no place to keep them on the vacuum itself, many of us will keep them in a box and forget about them quickly.</p>
<p><b>HEPA-class filters</b>: High-efficiency particulate air filters (almost always called HEPA-class) are defined by the U.S. Department of Energy as filters trapping 99.97% of tiny 0.3-micron particles that pass through. If the manufacturer doesn&#8217;t specify HEPA filtration, you&#8217;re almost certainly blowing a lot of fine dust into the air when you vacuum.</p>
<p><b>Sealed-system airflow:</b> Expensive filters are needed to capture allergy-triggering dust, but if your vacuum isn&#8217;t well-sealed, some of that dust will just leak out all the same.</p>

<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<p>The critical tests for a vacuum involve, of course, cleaning floors. But the features that make a vacuum excellent on tile floors may not be as good on wall-to-wall carpet, area rugs or hardwood.</p>
<p>We sprinkled samples of precisely weighed debris samples on carpet, then weighed the bags or canisters of the vacuums after to see how much of the dirt was recovered. On bare floors, we put down the same dirt as well as cereal and tested for scatter and efficient pick up of the biggest pieces.</p>
<p>A powered &#8220;beater&#8221; brushroll makes a big difference getting sand and dirt out of carpet, and it was easy to see the impact of agitation and brushing in the results.</p>
[table id=322 /]
<p>The turbine-powered brushroll on the Electrolux &#8211; EL4021A didn&#8217;t help much, though. It got stuck in longer carpet fibers and was only slightly more effective than the bare-floor tools included in less expensive vacuums. The height control on the Kenmore heads gave the biggest advantage in long-pile carpet, but Shark&#8217;s dual-brush system performed almost just as well.</p>
<p>Too much suction will make it hard to move a vacuum over thick carpet, or even get caught on the edges of area rugs. All of these canister vacuums offer some way to either slow down the suction motor or allow some air to bypass through a vent. That makes them more versatile than even the most prestigious brands in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">upright vacuum review</a> that just got bogged down or stuck.</p>
<h3>Suction</h3>
<p>In order to compare the raw power of these vacuum motors, we plugged them each into a vacuum gauge rig and noted the maximum amount of negative pressure made by the motors.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25539" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test.jpg" alt="Suction test" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/suction-test-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The difference in power between the most expensive and least expensive groups is worth noting, but all of these vacuums have enough power to easily pick up heavy sand and debris on all floor types. For carpet, the higher suction numbers won&#8217;t really help without excellent height control, or a more complex brushroll system like the Shark &#8211; Apex uses.</p>
<h3>HEPA filter</h3>
<p>We logged air quality readings with a Dylos particle counter before, during and after our cleaning tests to see how well the HEPA-class filters in some models actually capture dust. These tests weren&#8217;t performed in a sealed room, but the air was cleaned to a baseline level between tests with the Winix air purifier from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">air purifier review</a> running for five minutes.</p>
<p>The readings after vacuuming showed even most HEPA-filter vacuums kicking up three times more large dust particles into the air than we measured at the start of the test — on average from 13 up to 48 parts per million (PPM). The worst case was the Bissell &#8211; Zing: Its basic foam filter didn&#8217;t catch much dust, and there was ten times the starting level in the air after vacuuming.</p>
<p>Between its strong airflow and effective filter design, the Kenmore &#8211; Elite made an impressive 20% improvement in air quality compared to starting conditions — a powerful sealed-system vacuum can actually clean your air as well as your floor.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t carefully time the vacuuming time on this test, only analyzing the performance while actively cleaning our test carpet. In past tests, we&#8217;ve seen that a good vacuum from Shark or Dyson can clean the air if it&#8217;s left running for a few minutes, but the Kenmore did that even while cleaning the floor.</p>
[table id=323 /]
<h3>Noise</h3>
<p>We tested all of the vacuums from the same distance, at ear-height while moving the vacuums as they would be used for cleaning. We used a meter with an &#8220;A-weighted&#8221; frequency bias, which emphasizes the effect of bothersome high-pitch sounds and is the standard method to measure noise (rather than something like music).</p>
<p>The winner of this test was no surprise. The Shark &#8211; Apex won our pick for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">best upright vacuum</a> and is the quietest vacuum we&#8217;ve ever used: With the brushroll turned down to bare-floor mode the suction motor puts out 88 dBA, about as loud as the average level of film dialog in most movie theaters. Turning up the brushroll speed for carpet increased the noise to a fairly normal 93 dBA, very close to the same volume as the more expensive Kenmore &#8211; Elite.</p>
<p>By comparison, the air-powered brushroll on the Eureka brought the noise level up to 102 decibels — definitely not something you&#8217;ll want to use early in the morning.</p>
<h3>Storage and ergonomics</h3>

<p>The biggest advantage of a canister vacuum is the long reach offered by the hose, but compared to <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">the best upright vacuums</a> or <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuums</a>, that&#8217;s also a downside when you need to put it in the closet. As a consolation, most of these canister vacuums offer collapsing wands and retracting power cords to keep the storage as simple as possible.</p>
<p>An adjustable-length attachment wand is mostly important for reaching high ceilings or vacuuming on top of furniture with a detail brush, but some shorter or taller people may also find vacuuming the floor easier after adjusting the length of the wand.</p>
<p>Probably the most important factor for ease of use is the location of the vacuum&#8217;s controls. Usually only the most expensive vacuums give you power and brushroll control switches on the handle; less expensive models require you to reach down to the base of the vacuum or tap buttons with your foot.</p>
<h3>Tools and accessories</h3>
[table id=325 /]
<p>One accessory that sets apart the most expensive vacuums is a small powered rotary-brush tool, specifically designed for grabbing pet hair that sticks to furniture. Less-expensive vacuums sometimes include an air-powered version that might be worth trying out, but those are ineffective for tougher jobs like cleaning carpeted stairs.</p>
<p>All models we tested include a detail brush and a crevice tool to get into furniture cracks. The best models also include a place to keep every tool so they won&#8217;t get lost in your closet.</p>

<p>If you want a top-class canister vacuum with great suction power and a versatile cleaning head that will handle both carpet and bare floors, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F8DZQV/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; Elite 21814 Crossover</a> is our choice.</p>
<p>This has all the strengths of a top-of-the-line canister vacuum system: It&#8217;s lightweight, has excellent organization features for easy storage and a bagged dirt collection system that captures more fine dust and makes disposal easy.</p>
<p>Kenmore gives you all these features for less than $500. Given that the canister vacuums you&#8217;ll find at vacuum dealers will usually cost $800 or even $1200 for a comparable feature set, it&#8217;s a bargain.</p>
<h3>Multi-surface design</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kenmore-crossover-mode.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Rather than having a separate head for carpet and bare-floor cleaning, Kenmore gives you a convertible system called the “Crossover&#8221; head. The bare-floor tool snaps into the carpet head, and it&#8217;s easy to lift out with the press of a foot lever.</p>
<p>The Crossover head is a very good carpet head, with an easy-to-adjust height control and a heavy hardwood agitator brushroll that will help you get dirt out of your carpet. This head is easier to steer on carpet than the less expensive Kenmore design, though not quite as refined as the Shark.</p>
<h3>The most powerful vacuum cleaner</h3>
<p>The Kenmore &#8211; Elite has the best suction power of all the vacuums we&#8217;ve tested — even 5% better than the new motor design in the Apex — pulling minus 23 kilopascals of air pressure. That makes it excellent for getting dirt out of floor cracks and picking crumbs out of your couch.</p>
<p>Moving up the handle, the premium features that set the Elite apart from other canister vacuums in the under-$500 price bracket are handle-mounted control. You can turn the vacuum on and activate or deactivate the brushroll without bending over, and you can also control the level of suction bypass with an easy-to-use slider. This means you&#8217;ve got full manual control of the vacuum, making it easier to move from bare floors to small area rugs to full carpet.</p>
<h3>Best vacuum for allergies</h3>
<p>It’s a high-quality vacuum just by itself, but Kenmore also gives you excellent filtration. We were also impressed by the performance of other sealed systems like the Shark in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">pet hair vacuum tests</a>, but the Kenmore was about 20% better at capturing fine dust.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;ve got a complete line of accessory tools, it&#8217;s important that the vacuum provides a good place to keep them all. Fortunately Kenmore did just that with the Elite, so you don&#8217;t have to hunt in your closet for missing tools when it&#8217;s time to clean your blinds.</p>
<p>Like most good canister vacuums, the Kenmore includes a retractable power cord. There&#8217;s an adjustable-length wand that goes from 43 to 55 inches, both for the comfort of taller or shorter users and for reaching up to the ceiling with the cleaning brush attachments.</p>
<p>The Kenmore &#8211; Elite is designed to sit securely on a stair, and it does that job well. There&#8217;s even an included Pet PowerMate miniature brush head that makes quick touch-up jobs easy. It&#8217;s better for cleaning dog hair off of sofa cushions than it is for a full staircase job, but at least it won&#8217;t stall out on carpet like turbine-powered tools do.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>For the most power and great features, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F8DZQV/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; Elite 21814 Crossover</a> competes with vacuums that cost double or triple this price.</li>
<li>The full-size bare floor head and powered carpet head dock together for quickly changing between floor types.</li>
<li>The included HEPA-class filtration works well enough to clean your air while you vacuum.</li>
<li>It was the quietest of the conventional canisters we tested, even at full power.</li>
<li>This is a big vacuum, only slightly more nimble than an upright.</li>

<p>We chose to include the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> lift-away vacuum in this roundup of canister designs because it represents a unique set of attributes at an excellent value. This is more closely related to an upright vacuum than a canister, but it&#8217;s one of the few uprights that makes just as much sense for a household that would typically prefer a canister design.</p>
<p>While most traditional vacuums basically force you to switch between a rotary-brush head for effective carpet cleaning and a simpler suction-only head for bare floors, Shark has pioneered the use of a thick, soft roller that captures dirt on bare floors and doesn&#8217;t just throw it around before it gets sucked in. They call this a &#8220;DuoClean&#8221; brush system, and it works effectively on all the floor types we&#8217;ve tried.</p>
<p>The Shark is also more agile than other fully-powered brushroll systems, and it has handle-switched lower-power settings that will keep it from eating up area rugs. For mixed flooring types, this vacuum is just as good as the Kenmore Elite, but you can&#8217;t shed the weight of the brushroll for quicker coverage of large bare-floor surfaces.</p>
<h3>Also the best for pet hair</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brushspin.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The Apex also features Shark&#8217;s new &#8220;Zero-M&#8221; system, which actively combs out hairs so they don&#8217;t get wrapped around the roller. This makes the Shark &#8211; Apex the best canister vacuum for pet hair, or even for extra-long human hair. You&#8217;ll only ever catch a few strands on the roller, which eliminates the maintenance needed on traditional roller designs.</p>
<p>Bagless designs usually aren&#8217;t quite as good at capturing fine dust, but part of what makes this Shark the best bagless canister vacuum is a HEPA filter that worked better than the rest (including Dyson&#8217;s) in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">review of upright vacuums</a>. Against the tougher competition of bagged canister vacuums, the Apex let more fine dust into the air than Kenmore&#8217;s top-of-the-line sealed bag system did. The difference is only about 20%, and the Shark captured more large dust particles, so we&#8217;re happy with this performance considering the other advantages of the system.</p>
<p>Shark also includes the obligatory mini-power-brush for cleaning dog hair off your sofa. It’s powered by an electric motor so it won&#8217;t just stall out the way cheaper versions of this attachment do if you try to use them on your stairs.</p>
<p>Most of Shark&#8217;s accessories have a handy storage spot, but the various model numbers (we tested the AZ1000W) may include accessory brushes that don&#8217;t have a home.</p>

The soft rollers work well on all surfaces, but the hose is short in canister mode.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<h3>The drawbacks</h3>
<p>There are a few things we don&#8217;t like about the Shark in canister mode.</p>
<p>The lack of wheels for the motor canister unit and the very short hose mean you&#8217;re basically forced to carry the motor around in one hand while you vacuum, rather than towing it behind you as you work through tight spaces. The agility of Shark&#8217;s motorized brush head makes steering with one hand no problem, but if you&#8217;ve got a large room to cover you&#8217;ll definitely want to use upright mode most of the time.</p>
<p>The Shark doesn&#8217;t have a retractable cord. That&#8217;s not the most important feature on a vacuum, but it&#8217;s a standard on canister designs and makes storage easier. Retractable cord systems add weight and the Apex is already a heavy vacuum as it is, but on a premium-tier vacuum, we&#8217;d like to see some innovation beyond the bare-bones wrapping system.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re only interested in a canister vacuum for tricky spots like vacuuming under a coffee table and on the stairs, the Shark &#8211; Apex will handle those jobs well while serving as a full-featured multi-surface upright vacuum the rest of the time.</p>
<p>If you think the short-hose lift-away mode will meet your needs, but you&#8217;re not interested in using it on carpet, and you want to save some money, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a> was a runner-up in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">best upright vacuum review</a> and winner of our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuum review</a>. It&#8217;s still excellent at cleaning carpets in an upright configuration while giving acceptable performance in lift-away mode on bare floors.</p>

<p>Choosing a canister vacuum without a powered carpet head was tricky, since the bare-floor cleaning that these vacuums are best at isn&#8217;t particularly complicated. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075PKTS85/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; Zing</a> offers good power at a very affordable price, and it doesn&#8217;t skimp on the details.</p>
<p>The Zing offers basically the same two-mode floor-cleaning head as the other sub-$300 vacuums we tested, with a bristle-down position for gliding across hardwood and tile and a bristle-retracted mode for sliding along low-pile carpet.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to use a basic canister vacuum like this for medium-pile or longer carpet; it&#8217;ll just get stuck. You can turn down the suction to make gliding along easier, but at that point you&#8217;re not really vacuuming up much dirt. The Bissell &#8211; Zing did manage to pull slightly more dirt out of our test carpet than the other non-powered heads in our test, but it was a very difficult process.</p>

For bare floors and cleaning tight spots, this is a tool that will get the job done efficiently.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075PKTS85/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Bissell also lacks the HEPA filter featured on more expensive canisters, and it threw five times more dust particles into the air than the closest competition. That said, vacuuming when nobody will be in a room for a few hours, then running an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">air purifier</a> or opening a window and using a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-tower-fan/">tower fan</a>, can take care of that problem.</p>
<p>The biggest strength of the Bissell is simplicity. You still get essential features, like a retractable power cord and adjustable-length wand, but the only accessory comes in the form of a clip-on brush and crevice multi-purpose tool.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>For less than $75, the Bissell &#8211; Zing is a compact, effective vacuum.</li>
<li>The bare-floor tool serves its intended function well.</li>
<li>Storage and handling features are surprisingly refined.</li>
<li>This bagged system only has basic dust filtering.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t bother with a vacuum like this for carpet or area rugs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Kenmore &#8211; 200 Series</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25535" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series.jpg" alt="Kenmore - 200 series" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenmore-200series-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you want a powered brushroll for some carpet-cleaning tasks but don&#8217;t need all the other features of the Kenmore &#8211; Elite, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F4YTVF/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; 81214 200 Series</a> canister vacuum is an affordable mid-range option.</p>
<p>For about a $200 savings compared to the Elite, you&#8217;ve given up handle-mounted controls, the bigger bare-floor tool, two feet of hose length, noise reduction, dust capture performance and more agile steering. This isn&#8217;t a vacuum we&#8217;d choose above other designs unless budget were the primary consideration.</p>
<p>Compared to the other sub-$300 vacuums we tested, you still get a motorized height-adjustable carpet head and a powerful suction motor. The small bare-floor head and difficult steering on carpet really handicap this model in most households where a mid-range canister vacuum makes sense, though.</p>
<h3>Electrolux &#8211; EL4021A</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25532" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux.jpg" alt="Electrolux" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/electrolux-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J8AYAT4/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Electrolux &#8211; EL4021A</a> is a bagless canister vacuum from a well-regarded manufacturer, but its middle-tier features and performance make it hard to recommend.</p>
<p>Most confusing of the results from our tests were the air quality results for this model: Despite the advertised HEPA filter, this vacuum kicked up just as much dust as the non-HEPA Bissell model.</p>
<p>Electrolux includes a turbine-powered carpet head with this model, and that was also a disappointment. It&#8217;s incredibly loud, and stalls out quickly on anything thicker than tight-knit carpet like Berber. The Electrolux was light and fairly easy to maneuver, but for cleaning performance the Kenmore &#8211; 200 Series has it totally beat.</p>
<h3>Eureka &#8211; Mighty Mite Pet Lover</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25533" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka.jpg" alt="Eureka" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Eureka-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For those looking at budget vacuums but are still in need of dust filtration, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0019KOFEC/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; Mighty Mite Pet Lover</a> takes a popular utility vacuum design and literally clips an extra filter to the back.</p>
<p>The Mighty Mite isn&#8217;t a bad little vacuum, but the price increase to get the HEPA filter is hard to swallow. Compared to the Bissell &#8211; Zing, you get bigger detailing tools (with some onboard storage) but give up some airflow on account of the filter. You can attach the hose to the exhaust side of this canister for situations when you want a blower, but you&#8217;re better off buying an inexpensive <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">leaf blower</a> for most situations where that would be an asset.</p>
<p>The included air-turbine-powered pet-hair brush isn&#8217;t good on carpet, and there&#8217;s no place to store it on the vacuum so most owners will likely lose it quickly.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re seriously considering the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014P3BL5U/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">less expensive Eureka &#8211; 3670h</a> without the $40 filter, look closely at the Bissell &#8211; Zing first. The retractable cord is a worthwhile upgrade for most households.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Canister vacuums aren&#8217;t as popular in North America as upright vacuums, but we&#8217;ve tested and compared them in situations where they make the most sense: Tight quarters, bare-floor cleaning and situations where the extra dust control from a bagged system is a key asset.</p>
<p>With those parameters, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075F8DZQV/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kenmore &#8211; Elite</a> is a clear winner for anyone who also needs to deal with carpeted floors. The power, filter performance, ease of use and flexibility of this system are competitive with the better-known European brands, but at one-third the price.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re covering enough floor that you&#8217;re trying to decide between a canister and upright vacuum, the convertible <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> has most of the flexibility on stairs and in tight spaces as a canister, but is much better on open ground. It&#8217;s easily the best bagless vacuum we&#8217;ve tested.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you&#8217;re looking for an inexpensive canister vacuum with only a bare floor head, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075PKTS85/?tag=ybdcanvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; Zing</a> is our budget pick. It doesn&#8217;t have the filter or carpet-cleaning prowess of other vacuums, but it has plenty of power for the price.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After testing the top-selling brands, we've picked the Rubbermaid - Roughneck as the best storage containers for closet and garage.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing seven different types of containers side-by-side and taking a close look at materials, we&#8217;re confident that the classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KBJ46LK/?tag=ybdstorcon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Roughneck</a> bin is still the best storage container. These polyethylene tubs are tough, so they won&#8217;t shatter in cold storage or when dropped like most bins will. If you&#8217;ve got less demanding needs, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MWTJX2S/?tag=ybdstorcon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ziploc &#8211; Weathershield</a> containers let you see what&#8217;s inside, they&#8217;re water-tight and they come in stackable combinations.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>Our test team has been using storage containers to organize nearly every part of their eclectic lives: In homes, on the farm, at warehouses and even for travel. Over the years, our testers have bought numerous brands and styles of storage containers for different applications. Some have served faithfully for decades in storage sheds, while some were only good for a year before cracking.</p>
<p>We carefully examined lids and materials on all the bins we could find at four different retailers, and cross-referenced with online reviews from sites like Wirecutter, Art of Cleanliness, and Reddit.</p>
<h3>The beloved classic</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KBJ46LK/?tag=ybdstorcon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Roughneck</a> containers are made of flexible, tough polyethylene, and most discussion board posts we read agree that they&#8217;re the gold standard for rugged and reliable storage.</p>
<p>The downside we saw immediately to the Roughneck is that many retailers have stopped keeping them on store shelves and require you to buy sets of six or eight tubs to justify the not-exactly-free shipping.</p>
<p>Sadly, most retailers are now mostly stocking alternatives that only look similar to Rubbermaid&#8217;s styling. In a few cases the polypropylene imitators had cracked while they were still on the store shelf.</p>
<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<p>We found one other affordable polyethylene bin, the Sterilite &#8211; Ultra, with better in-store availability and some design trade-offs. We dismissed other imitators that look more similar to Roughneck&#8217;s construction, but with the same availability issues and poor reviews.</p>
<p>We also sought out the most affordable containers we&#8217;d still trust to keep in storage and found a few options that have compelling features to make up for reduced durability compared to tough polyethylene bins.</p>
<p>We looked into sealed roto-molded containers from brands like Pelican and SKB, but the prices aren&#8217;t justifiable unless you&#8217;re transporting delicate devices to the field or on flights every day. Other large freight-quality shipping containers are a neat idea, but also too expensive for garage or closet storage. We did pick up a Rubbermaid &#8211; Brute commercial-grade container, to see just how much tougher it is to justify the big price jump over Roughneck bins.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Materials: Polyethylene vs. polypropylene &#8211;</b> Low-density polyethylene (stamped on the bottom as LDPE, recycling group number four) is more flexible than stiff, cheap polypropylene (recycling group five), so it won&#8217;t crack as easily if you drop a loaded bin on the garage floor. It also won&#8217;t become brittle at freezing temperatures the way polypropylene does.</p>

<p>Each material has some advantages. <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/lab-plasticware-supplies/plastic-material-selection/polypropylene-pp-labware.html#pp-physical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polypropylene</a> can be made see-through, and it&#8217;s much more heat resistant — all the way up to boiling temperatures. <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/lab-plasticware-supplies/plastic-material-selection/low-density-polyethylene-ldpe-labware.html#ldpe-physical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LDPE</a> is always tougher, but it gets very soft at temperatures above 110 degrees fahrenheit and melts in boiling water. Our testers have seen far more polypropylene bins fail in long-term storage, especially in cold climates, but in a baking-hot attic you&#8217;d want to be very careful about how much weight stack on an LDPE bin.</p>
<p><b>Latching lids &#8211;</b> A flip-up latch will hold your bin closed even if you over-stuff it, which is handy for things like bulky sweaters and puffy blankets. If you put too much strain on latches, though, they&#8217;re prone to pop out of the mounting holes. Those holes also mean an entry point for moisture and insects.</p>
<p><b>A waterproof seal &#8211;</b> If you just need a bin to shed rain, almost any will do: with one exception, the lids we tested cover the edge of the bin, which means water will roll off without getting inside. A totally sealed lid (like our top pick) will also keep out humidity, though damp items can mildew quickly if you&#8217;re not careful about what you put in the bin.</p>
<p><b>Stackable designs &#8211;</b> Nearly any bin can stand on top of another, but some designs are able to neatly mix and match small and large bins while creating a topple-resistant tower.</p>
<p><b>Single-size lids &#8211;</b> If you&#8217;re building a collection of storage containers to fully organize your life, it can be handy to have bins with same-size openings. This usually means you can stack and nest different sizes as well as sharing lids between them. Usually there will be at least two sizes in a series of containers with a common lid and footprint size, with the difference in volume made up by height.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested eight of the best lightweight vacuums and chose the Shark - Rocket HV302 as the best corded vacuum for everyday and heavy-duty cleaning. We also picked the Eureka - NEC22 as the best cordless lightweight vacuum.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent 20 hours on research and six weeks testing each of the vacuums in a home environment. We chose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUKHACW/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Rocket HV302</a> as our pick for the best lightweight vacuum. Weighing just 8 pounds (the average vacuum weighs 14 to 17 pounds), it is one of the more powerful vacuums we tested. The Shark possesses agility and suction strong enough to make it feel as though it were self-propelled. If you want a cordless model, we found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNJ7ZR1/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEC222</a> to be the best option. It pulls up an impressive amount of debris and has swivel steering that makes it easy to navigate around furniture.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Since a vacuum weighing more than 15 pounds can cause arm fatigue when pushed around large spaces or carried up stairs, we limited our scope to vacuums weighing 15 pounds and under. Corded vacuums tends to be more powerful, while cordless ones are more convenient. Keeping this in mind, we searched for the best options in each category.</p>
<p>We’ve tested multiple types of vacuums here at Your Best Digs, as we searched for everything from the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-upright-vacuum/">best upright vacuum</a> to the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">best handheld vacuum</a>. These previous experiences have given us a good sense of overall features to consider when also factoring in a lightweight aspect.</p>
<p>For instance, we considered the fact that swivel steering can greatly impact the amount of work it takes to move a vacuum around. If you’re choosing a lightweight vacuum because you want to ease the strain of pushing a heavy vacuum around, this is an important feature to note.</p>
<p>We looked at reputable sources such as Consumer Reports and Wirecutter to gather information about the top lightweight vacuums on the market. Once we narrowed down a list of finalists that had the features we deemed most important, we culled the list further based on Amazon reviews and reports from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LaundryLoveandScience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laundry Love &amp; Cleaning Science</a> Facebook group.</p>

<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Vacuums over 15 pounds become tough to move around, an important consideration if you need to cover more square footage or carry it upstairs. The vacuums we tested weighed 3 to 8 pounds.</li>
<li><strong>Swivel steering:</strong> Maneuverability is key if you’re choosing a vacuum based on its ease of use. Even a lightweight vacuum can cause arm fatigue without swivel steering, since you need to make double the effort to guide it around the room.</li>
<li><strong>Corded vs. cordless:</strong> Corded vacuums are typically more powerful than cordless vacuums, although some newer cordless models are nearly as powerful as a corded vacuum.</li>
<li><strong>Battery life/run time:</strong> If you do choose a cordless model, consider how long the battery takes to charge and how long you can run the vacuum before the battery dies.</li>
<li><strong>Sealed HEPA filter:</strong> If you have allergies or asthma, you’ll want to make sure your vacuum traps dust mites, pet dander and pollen in a tightly sealed system. A vacuum with a sealed HEPA filter must meet the rigorous <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/ttncatc1/dir1/ff-hepa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. HEPA</a> (High Efficiency Particulate Air) standards of removing 99.97 percent of all particles 0.3 microns or larger.</li>
<li><strong>Low profile:</strong> A vacuum that lies flat is able to fit under furniture, which means you can clean without moving heavy objects around the room.</li>
<li><strong>Easy emptying:</strong> Whether using a bagged or bagless model, you should be able to empty the vacuum without dirt escaping.</li>
<li><strong>Brush roll:</strong> A spinning beater brush agitates debris in the carpet for a deeper clean, but on hard floors, it can scratch the surface and fling debris away. A better option for hard flooring is a vacuum that allows you to turn off the beater brush or, better yet, has a soft roller head.</li>
<li><strong>Converts into handheld vacuum:</strong> A model that converts into a handheld vacuum gives you the most bang for your buck and allows you to use it on multiple cleaning tasks. It’s convenient to have a vacuum that can clean your floors as well as your car. If you’re primarily looking to use your vacuum as a handheld, our article on the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum">best handheld vacuum</a> can guide you in the right direction.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple attachments:</strong> Attachments such as a soft roller head for hard floors, a crevice tool and a dusting tool allow you to tackle multiple cleaning jobs with one vacuum.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustable-height cleaning head:</strong> Automatic height adjustment allows you to switch from carpet to hard flooring, although you may want to turn your brush roll off or switch to a soft roller head.</li>

[table id=296 /]
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We tested in a household with three children and three fur babies — two dogs and a domestic shorthair cat — and the carpet was embedded with pet hair. We added sand, baking soda (to mimic fine dust) and cereal (large debris) to the mix. Starting with empty collection containers, we passed each vacuum over the area for 30 seconds. Then we weighed the output in grams to test how much each vacuum collected.</p>
<p>Pet hair is naturally lighter than sand or cereal, so while we measured the contents of each collection container, we visually inspected the carpet to see if there was any debris remaining. The type of debris collected gave us insight into which vacuums picked up more fine debris and which gathered the most pet hair.</p>
<p>Finally, we performed the same test again on hard flooring. We paid attention to whether or not the vacuums snowplowed (pushed forward rather than sucked up) the large debris.</p>
<p>The Oreck, Dyson and Eureka were able to capture the most pet hair, sand and baking soda at the same time without the brush roll or filter becoming clogged. The Shark picked up a large amount of pet hair from the carpet, but the hair wound itself around the filter and created a pressure that caused it to “backfire,” sending larger pieces of debris back onto the carpet.</p>
<p>The Hoover does a good job of picking up surface pet hair and cereal, but it doesn’t do much to pull up ground-in dirt and debris from the carpet. It pulls in cereal without snowplowing it across the floor, even better than some of our more expensive finalists. For example, the Tineco isn’t able to retain larger pieces of debris, leaving them on the floor after you move the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Emissions</h3>
<p>The best vacuums are able to keep the dirt contained in their collection bag or cylinder, so the dust and debris isn’t spewed back out into the air. This is especially important if you have allergies. To test filter performance, we measured dust kickback with a Dylos air quality monitor.</p>
<p>The laser counter measures air quality in terms of both large particles (PM10) and small particles (PM2.5). Particle pollution can be especially harmful to those with asthma, older adults and babies and children. Smaller particles are more troublesome because they can get into the deep parts of your lungs.</p>
<p>We took a reading before vacuuming, then measured the air quality again after vacuuming a single room for 10 minutes. Some vacuums, such as the Oreck and the Bissell, caused the numbers to jump dramatically. The Shark and the Dyson actually improved the quality of the air, reducing both large and small airborne particles. The Eureka and Deik were relatively neutral, neither spewing dust nor filtering it out of the air.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>Over the course of six weeks, we used these vacuums to vacuum as any consumer would. We vacuumed in multiple rooms on both hard flooring and carpet for approximately 30 minutes at a time.</p>
<p>Since we wanted to find the best lightweight vacuum, key considerations here were arm fatigue and maneuverability. We rated each vacuum on a scale of one to five (five being best) for ease of use, giving the highest ratings to vacuums that didn’t cause arm fatigue.</p>
<p>We maneuvered each vacuum around the room and judged how easy it was to operate. Then we tested its profile by lying it flat and vacuuming under a couch and living-room chairs. We noted features such as button placement and ability to determine what the settings meant without consulting the manual. Finally, we considered how easy it was to change the filter or empty the waste container.</p>
<p>Our five-star finalists for maneuverability were the Shark, Eureka, Tineco and Deik. Despite being only 8.2 pounds, the Oreck was incredibly difficult to push around the room. The stronger the suction, the more difficult it was to push &#8212; with the exception of the Shark, which feels as if it is propelling forward without effort. Finalists like the Dyson and Tineco were easy to operate, but we encountered resistance on their Max settings and vacuuming became more labor-intensive.</p>
<h3>Noise output</h3>
<p>For this test, we measured the sound output in decibels of each vacuum using a sound pressure level meter. The ambient noise level of the room measured at 59.3 decibels, with a fan running and someone cooking in the other room. We held the meter at ear level while running each vacuum to gauge the noise exposure while actually using the vacuum.</p>
<p>The average noise level of our finalists was 79 dBA, when the vacuums were used at their highest setting. Comparatively, it’s the <a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/loud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sound of a freight train</a> from 100 feet away. Our loudest vacuum, the Oreck, was closer to the sound levels of a boiler room at 88.6 dBA. The Eureka was the quietest vacuum, measuring 71.3 dBA, or a little louder than classroom chatter. The Shark had a wide range of noise levels, from 83.5 dBA on its max setting to just below the average noise level at 77.2 dBA on its lowest setting.</p>

<p>In our tests, we found the vacuums with better suction tended to be harder to move around the floor. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUKHACW/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Rocket HV302</a> is the exception; the power and the motorized brush roll work together to make it feel as though it is self-propelled. Swivel steering adds even greater agility, making the Shark easy to navigate around furniture. The combination of power and maneuverability made the Shark our top choice for a lightweight vacuum.</p>
<p>The Shark doesn’t snowplow large debris and is excellent at pulling up dirt and debris from along wall edges. The filter is simple to reach and remove using a flip-top lid and the waste canister is easy to empty. It has a 30-foot cord, so it’s easy to reach across the room and even down the hallway, depending on the size of your rooms.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t have a HEPA filter, the Shark performed on par with the Dyson in terms of emissions (and the Dyson is priced three times higher). It lowered both the large particle count and small particle count in the room after vacuuming. It pulled up sand and fine debris in large amounts, impressing us with how clean the floor looked after vacuuming with the Shark.</p>

It glides smoothly across carpet and easily navigates around furniture and against wall edges.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUKHACW/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The motorized brush roll helps to agitate dirt from carpets, while the included Hard Floor Hero head serves to pick up surface litter and stuck-on food or dirt. So you have the option to adjust the height with a switch and keep vacuuming across different floor types or change out the vacuum head.</p>
<p>This model converts into a hand vacuum with a dusting brush, upholstery brush and crevice tool. It also comes with a car-detail kit with micro tools for detailing your automobile.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>As powerful as the Shark is, it didn’t fare well in our pet hair test. For a better option, see our review on <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">vacuums for pet hair</a>. In fact, the power may have been part of the problem. It sucked up so much pet hair at one time that within 30 seconds the filter was too clogged to retain any more debris.</p>
<p>The other downside is that it is one of the heavier finalists we tested. Although it only weighs eight pounds, the majority of the weight is in the handheld portion of the vacuum. It may not be the best choice for you if your wrist is easily strained. Because it is so top heavy, it also doesn’t stand up on its own.</p>
<p>However, you can mount it on the included wall bracket for storage. You can also detach the hand vac from the floor mount and place it on the hook above the floor nozzle for easy storage.</p>
<p>These considerations aside, the Shark has enough pros that we feel comfortable recommending it as our top choice for a corded lightweight vacuum.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Shark &#8211; Rocket HV302 is easy to use and maneuver, as the combination of strong suction and a motorized brush head reduces the force needed to push the vacuum.</li>
<li>Swivel steering makes vacuuming around furniture effortless, and a low profile allows you to reach under couches easily.</li>
<li>Our air was cleaner after vacuuming with the Shark, as its tightly sealed system and effective filter trapped fine and larger dust particles while running.</li>
<li>This model may not be the best choice for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">pet owners</a>, as pet hair tends to clog in the filter and reduce efficacy.</li>

<p>Priced lower than average, especially for a cordless model, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNJ7ZR1/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEC222</a> is well worth the investment of a high-end vacuum. It is quiet but powerful and swivel steering makes it a breeze to move around the room. The low profile makes it a snap to clean underneath furniture, while its agility makes it easy to get around large pieces.</p>
<p>The Eureka aced our performance test, picking up as many grams of dirt as the Dyson and pulling up embedded pet hair without clogging. While it didn’t clean the air in our emissions test, it also retained any large or fine debris it pulled up from the carpet so you don’t have to worry about dust kickback.</p>
<p>It has the brightest front headlights, making it easy to see in low lighting. The waste canister empties at the touch of a button; there’s also a second option to twist off the collection cup.</p>

Paired with a quiet but powerful motor, this model handily won our pick for best lightweight cordless.</p><a href="" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The things we liked most about this vacuum were its performance on both pet hair and fine dust and its quiet motor. The Eureka is only 6.5 pounds, so despite the motor being located at the handle, it didn’t put any pressure on our wrist.</p>
<p>The vacuum converts into a hand vac and comes with a crevice tool and a two-in-one upholstery tool. It has a solid 30 minutes of run time and charges in four hours.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>Our main concern with the Eureka is that the controls aren’t easily decipherable, so it’s hard to determine which symbol means carpet and which means hard floors (without consulting the manual, and let’s face it, we all know those end up in a junk drawer and are rarely consulted).</p>
<p>A secondary issue is that the brush head tends to lift off the ground, so it doesn’t always make full contact with the floor. This could mean it doesn’t pick up as much as it should or that you have to make multiple passes over the same area, unless you are actively ensuring that it fully engages with the carpet or hard flooring.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Eureka &#8211; NEC222 is reasonably priced for a lightweight cordless vacuum and well worth the expense.</li>
<li>If you want a lightweight cordless vacuum that rivals the Dyson in terms of performance and doesn’t kick back any dust, the Eureka is an excellent choice.</li>
<li>At 6.5 pounds, it’s so lightweight that the brush head tends to lift off the carpet, but it doesn’t cause any arm fatigue after a long period of vacuuming.</li>
<li>Despite being a powerful vacuum, the Eureka is one of the quietest models we tested.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZYPZ0I/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hoover &#8211; SH20030</a> wasn’t the absolute lowest-priced model we tested. However, of our eight finalists, it’s the best performing vacuum on the lower end of the price spectrum. It easily picked up pet hair and cereal in our performance test, and we especially liked that it could pick up debris along the edges of walls (thanks to edge cleaning bristles on the brush roll). It doesn’t deep clean as well as our other top picks, but it would be an excellent second vacuum for a quick pick up.</p>
<p>It runs smoothly on hard floors and doesn’t snowplow large debris, and you can easily transition between flooring types with a flick of the switch. It has a low profile and reaches under furniture with no problem. The swivel steering is useful for navigating around furniture and getting close to the edges.</p>

You may want to opt for a more heavy-duty vacuum to deep clean your carpets occasionally, but the Hoover will keep your room tidy and free of pet hair.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZYPZ0I/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Weighing only eight pounds, the weight is evenly distributed, so it’s easier to handle than our top-heavy cordless vacuums. Its 20-foot cord is long enough to reach across most rooms.</p>
<p>We also like that the Hoover is on the quieter side at only 75.9 dBA, less than our average rating of 79.4 across all models we tested. It’s also slim and stores upright, which makes it convenient to keep close at hand for those quick pick-up jobs.</p>
<h3>Things we didn’t like</h3>
<p>The Hoover performs better picking up large debris than fine dust. It’s a good choice for a lightweight, everyday vacuum,, but if you’re looking for a vacuum that really deep cleans, you may want to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>It doesn’t spew out fine particles (perhaps because it doesn’t pull them out of the carpet in the first place), but it does have trouble retaining large particles. If you have allergies or breathing issues, you may want to upgrade to a model with a more tightly sealed system.</p>

<li>The Hoover &#8211; SH20030 has a powered brush roll and edge-cleaning bristles, so it performs best on pet hair and along wall edges.</li>
<li>At less than half the price of our average for all the lightweight vacuums we tested, the Hoover is the best bang for your buck.</li>
<li>Swivel steering and a low profile makes this vacuum incredibly easy to operate, while its upright position makes it trouble-free to pause between tasks.</li>
<li>If you have allergies or asthma, you may want to opt for a more expensive model that has fewer emissions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>Dyson &#8211; V10 Absolute</h3>
<p>If you want a luxury upgrade, we highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0798FVV6V/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; V10 Absolute</a>. The price point is more than double the average cost of our vacuums, but every Dyson we have tested (including the V10 Absolute) outperforms the other finalists in terms of performance and air quality.</p>
<p>We didn’t name it our winner simply because it isn’t as easy to maneuver as our top picks, and we considered agility a top priority for a lightweight vacuum. The price point is higher than many consumers are able or willing to spend. Finally, we noted that the hygenic one-touch emptying bin tends to stick, making it more likely to spill the contents. (This wasn’t an issue with other Dyson models we previously tested.)</p>
<p>However, if you have pets or allergies, it may be worth it to invest in a Dyson for its ability to capture and retain both pet hair and dander. Dyson cord-free vacuums have whole machine filtration which captures 99 percent of particles as small as 0.3 microns.</p>
<h3>Oreck &#8211; XL2100RHS</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NDNV18/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oreck &#8211; XL2100RHS</a> is a bagged, corded and commercial model that performs extremely well in terms of pulling up embedded dirt and debris from carpet. It has plenty of power, but it’s also the noisiest vacuum of the models we tested. It also tends to drag along the floor and doesn’t have swivel steering, so alhough it weighs the same as the Shark, it causes arm fatigue, and the Shark doesn’t.</p>
<p>If you want a powerhouse vacuum and your main reason for choosing a lightweight vacuum is the ability to carry it upstairs easily, the Oreck is a good choice. However, if you have allergies or asthma, the trail of dust it leaves behind may make the Oreck a poor choice for you.</p>
<h3>Tineco &#8211; A11 Hero</h3>
<p>If maneuverability is what you prize most, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FFKYCRL/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tineco &#8211; A11 Hero</a> is hands down the most agile vacuum we tested. Unfortunately, it doesn’t possess the suction power to name it as our top cordless pick. It only picked up four grams of dirt in our performance test, and appeared to pick up large debris well (with no snow plowing), but would leave pieces behind after we turned off the suction.</p>
<p>It comes with two lithium-ion batteries and a dual charging dock, so you can run the vacuum for up to 60 minutes without interruption. The waste canister is easy to empty, and it is easy on the wrist at only 5.5 pounds, despite being top heavy.</p>
<h3>Deik &#8211; ZB1516</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FGRZJ29/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deik &#8211; ZB1516</a> has swivel steering, but the brush head doesn’t move as easily as our other contenders with swivel steering. Although it’s a top-heavy model like most of our lightweight cordless vacuums, the Deik weighs only 4.7 pounds so you don’t feel strain on the wrist.</p>
<p>It has a HEPA filter, but it tested as one of the neutral models in our emissions test. It doesn’t leave the air cleaner like the Shark or Dyson, but it doesn’t kick back dust either. Our overall impression of the Deik is neutral. At just over half the price of the average cost of our finalists, there isn’t anything negative about this vacuum, but it doesn’t have many standout qualities either.</p>
<h3>Bissell &#8211; Featherweight 2033</h3>
<p>If you need the absolute lightest vacuum for quick pick ups, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZY7BTWM/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; Featherweight 2033</a> is a decent option. It lies flat so you can get underneath furniture easily, although the head doesn’t swivel so it doesn’t navigate as well as other finalists. However, at only 3 pounds, maneuverability isn’t as much of an issue as it would be for heavier vacuums.</p>
<p>The short cord could be problematic if you have a larger area room, and the filter clogs easily with pet hair. For the price and weight, these issues may not be deal breakers. The Bissell is the lowest-priced model we tested, and although it doesn’t come with any bells or whistles or have much power, it will make your floor appear cleaner with minimal effort.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>When looking for the best lightweight vacuum, we wanted to find a model that was agile as well as lightweight. Whether you’re purchasing a lightweight vacuum because you have a higher area of square footage, multiple floors or a limited range of motion, a vacuum that maneuvers easily will make the task less labor-intensive.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EUKHACW/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Rocket HV302</a> has tremendous capabilities to capture and retain dust and debris, while still being easy to navigate around the room. For those who prefer a cordless model, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MNJ7ZR1/?tag=ybdltvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEC222</a> is another lightweight vacuum that combines power with ease of use.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing five vacuums in three different apartments and running controlled tests side by side, we&#8217;ve determined that the Shark &#8211; Apex is the best upright vacuum. This predator is at the top of the food chain with quiet power and effective cleaning on more surfaces than most other upright vacuum cleaners. The entry-level Shark &#8211; Navigator is also a good value at about half the price, and the Dirt Devil won a spot among our top picks with compact maneuverability.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After spending the last year researching and testing selections for task-specific categories like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">the best vacuums for pet owners</a>, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">handheld vacuums</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuums</a>, we were ready to tackle a more general overview of the vacuum market.</p>
<p>We read comparison reviews by traditional publications like Wirecutter and Consumer Reports, but we also sunk hours into the endless testing footage available from vacuum enthusiasts on YouTube. We also investigated the latest buzz on the r/vacuums subreddit.</p>
<p>Vacuum cleaners, like many appliances, are often sold with different model numbers or packages at different retailers. Even finding the most recent models or determining differences between model numbers is sometimes nearly impossible. Our researcher compared specs on 18 different models for Shark alone, and that&#8217;s just the currently available models.</p>
<p>We included Shark&#8217;s perennial classic, the Navigator, since it&#8217;s their best value in terms of power for dollar and is still readily available. We also included the new Shark &#8211; Apex AZ1002, a model with all of Shark&#8217;s latest bells and whistles at a correspondingly higher price.</p>
<p>Selecting a worthy competitor for the Apex was tough. Every review of the Shark vacuums praises their relative maneuverability, while Dyson vacuums (though powerful) tend to be considered clunky by comparison. We selected the Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2 rather than the larger, heavier, more expensive Animal or Cinetic models. (Some reviews actually show the Multi Floor to be more powerful than the Animal.)</p>
<p>Shark and Dyson have the high-end bagless vacuum market pretty much to themselves these days. We did find some well-regarded competitors in the budget bracket, though, with affordable and lightweight models from Dirt Devil and Eureka that had excellent customer reviews.</p>

[table id=240 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Cleaning path:</strong> A wider cleaning path means fewer passes to clean an area, but it usually also makes a vacuum less maneuverable.</p>
<p><strong>Edge cleaning gap:</strong> This is a measurement of the distance of the pickup track from the edge, which determines how much dirt is missed when you&#8217;re vacuuming along baseboards or furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Steering design:</strong> Dyson really made a name for themselves with the &#8220;big ball&#8221; steering design, but we&#8217;ve come a long way since the days when every vacuum handled like a giant commercial model. Swivelling heads are now a common feature that actually made two other brands easier to turn than the Dyson.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:</strong> Upright vacuums typically come with hose attachments that help you clean things like stairs, couches and drapes. Great attachments really make some jobs easier, but if you don&#8217;t have any upholstered furniture you might find yourself keeping them in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> Lower weight is always better for carrying and using a vacuum, so long as you aren&#8217;t giving up features you need. This is also an important factor if you&#8217;re vacuuming on hardwood, since lighter vacuums are less likely to leave scuff marks.</p>
<p><strong>Noise:</strong> All vacuums are loud, but some are louder than others. Sleeping housemates will thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Filter performance and sealed systems:</strong> High efficiency particulate air (&#8220;HEPA&#8221;) filters are common, and the filter itself almost always does a great job filtering out even the smallest dust particles. The big difference between vacuums is whether they&#8217;re fully sealed or just let dust escape out of cracks and gaps.</p>

<p><strong>Height to fit under furniture:</strong> Coffee tables, beds and other low-clearance furniture can be tricky to vacuum under. Low-profile vacuum beater heads can slip into more places without stopping to use a specialty attachment.</p>
<p><strong>Cord Length:</strong> You want to be able to vacuum your entire floor without switching outlets, so cord length is a big priority for larger rooms or even just getting down the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>Length of hose:</strong> If you want to get the most out of your specialty attachments, it&#8217;s nice to be able to roam a bit. This is especially important for high ceilings.</p>

<p><strong>Total reach:</strong> This spec is usually a combination of cord length and hose length, plus the longest extension attachment. We think it makes more sense to think about your needs for cord length and hose length separately, though.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty and service network:</strong> In the past, vacuum repair worked like car repair: You buy an expensive machine from a dealer and take it back in for repairs. Dyson still has a repair network, while Shark works mostly by shipping things in the mail.</p>
<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs an upright vacuum?</h2>
<p>Upright vacuums are great on carpet. If you&#8217;ve got wall-to-wall medium-pile carpet, an upright vacuum is probably going to be your first choice. If you have more than 500 square feet of carpet to clean, an upright also makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>For bare floors, like hardwood or tile, an upright vacuum usually isn&#8217;t the best choice. Picks from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-steam-mop/">steam mop review</a> will be a much better choice on tile or vinyl, though a good upright vacuum will still pick up dirt.</p>
<p>Being able to turn off the brushroll is an important feature if you&#8217;re going to use an upright on bare floors, since the brush will usually scatter dirt too much and doesn’t really help on a bare floor. Brushroll control is a standard feature for all the vacuums we looked at.</p>
<p>Upright vacuums put the weight of the motor above the brushroll, which helps it work into carpet fibers. That extra weight pushing down helps with getting out tough dirt, and for &#8220;grooming&#8221; longer carpet into that gorgeous freshly vacuumed look.</p>
<p>A good upright vacuum also makes cleaning floors more convenient. An upright keeps all of your vacuum parts rolling on one set of wheels, which means you only have to stop vacuuming when you get to the end of your cord.</p>
<p>The cordless models from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a> are even more convenient to carry around. An upright is wider, though, so it can clean more quickly, and it can also go longer before the dust cup fills up. Most importantly, a plug-in upright won&#8217;t run out of battery power before you finish cleaning.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21907" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright.jpg" alt="Canister vs. upright vacuums" width="1973" height="1315" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright.jpg 1973w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-1000x666.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/canister-vs-upright-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Generally speaking, an upright vacuum puts the suction motor, roller brush and dust receptacle in one piece riding on wheels with a long handle. A canister vacuum separates the motor and dust receptacle from the tools with a long hose, so you typically have most of the weight of the vacuum in a piece that follows you around on the floor while you hold the attachments and pickup tools.</p>
<p>Upright vacuums are similar to the oldest designs, basically adding suction and a bag to 19th-century carpet sweeper designs like the Bissel. Early upright designs were called &#8220;suction sweepers,&#8221; while early canister designs were called &#8220;suction dusters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those names highlight the strengths of each design: Upright vacuums are very efficient for &#8220;sweeping&#8221; over large surfaces, while the maneuverability and flexibility of a canister&#8217;s detached hose make it perfect for vacuuming things that aren&#8217;t your floor.</p>
<p>That said, most upright vacuums sold to consumers deliberately allow you to use a flexible hose and attachments, so you can still clean your drapes and upholstery.</p>
<p>Likewise, canister vacuums typically come with long-handled floor-sweeping attachments, and some even come with very nice electric-powered brushroll systems for plush carpet.</p>
<p>An upright vacuum really shines if you need to clean up and down a carpeted hall. The cord is long enough that you can finish the job without unplugging, and you won&#8217;t have to drag a canister along behind you. It&#8217;s also easier to store in a closet because of the small footprint.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re cleaning smaller rooms with lots of furniture, the lighter weight and low-profile head of a canister vacuum&#8217;s pickup tool make it much easier to work under and around obstacles. The drawbacks start when you have to move the canister body while you&#8217;re vacuuming.</p>
<p>Canister vacuums often come with air-powered tools, which means that only the flow of air is powering the brushroll that&#8217;s picking up hair and dirt from your carpet. Air-powered tools are better than nothing in a pinch, but they&#8217;re not nearly as effective as a motor-driven brush. We found out when testing the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuums</a> that just because a canister vacuum is expensive doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s always the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>Shark&#8217;s popular &#8220;lift-away&#8221; vacuum design tries to split the difference between a canister and an upright. If you want to separate the bulky motor housing from the floor tools you can just push a button and detach it. The hose is very short compared to a purpose-built canister system, but it has many of the same strengths when you need to vacuum under a bed or on carpeted stairs.</p>
<p>Note that among Shark models, only the powered lift-away models can run the brushroll motor when the base is detached. The un-powered Navigator, however, can still do bare-floor cleaning just as capably in this mode.</p>
<h2 id="why-bagless">Why a bagless vacuum cleaner?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21905" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister.jpg" alt="Bagless vacuum cleaner dust cup" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bagless-canister-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>It might seem like distant history, but for most of the hundred or so years of vacuum cleaning we&#8217;ve relied on a bag to capture dirt that&#8217;s picked up. Once the bag was full, you had to throw it away and replace it with a new one. Bags could be made from paper for cheaper designs, but more expensive bags used other materials for better reliability and filtration.</p>
<p>Various bagless vacuum designs have been tried, but it was James Dyson who really popularized the bagless concept. Dyson pioneered the use of &#8220;cyclonic&#8221; airflow to separate dirt inside the dust receptacle through centrifugal force. Twenty years later, nearly all consumer-grade vacuums are bagless.</p>
<p>Without cyclonic dust removal, filters are the weak point of any vacuum system. If the filter is too fine, not enough air will get through and they will plug up quickly. If the filter lets a lot of air through, dust particles will also escape. Bag systems slowly lose suction efficiency as the filter pores fill with dust.</p>
<p>Modern bagless vacuums all use cyclonic action to separate dust, which means they can all use HEPA filters and filter-exhaust air down to sub-micron particles without instantly plugging up. Bagless systems generally use filters that are designed to be washed, so you should never have to buy replacement parts.</p>
<p>One more perk of bagless designs is that you can more easily find a piece of jewelry or a micro SD card that you accidentally pick up.</p>
<p>The savings are a relief, and not having to hunt for replacement bags when your vacuum is discontinued is nothing to sneeze at, either. But there is at least one downside to bagless designs.</p>
<p>When your vacuum collects dirt in a bag, you can simply throw it away and move on if you pick up something sticky, smelly or otherwise nasty. With a bagless vacuum, you&#8217;ve got to clean out the plastic receptacle and wash the filter.</p>
<p>In the marketplace, bagless has been a clear winner. You can still find a few of the old standby brands that maintain marketshare among commercial users, but even Panasonic has left the US vacuum cleaner market altogether after making Kenmore&#8217;s vacuums for decades.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We tested each of these vacuums in real-world conditions over the course of two months in three different apartments. We also spent a week testing for specific performance criteria in side-by-side dirt pickup tests on different types of carpet, and we measured noise and dust output.</p>
<p>After all that testing, we sat down and analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each vacuum to decide which buyers they could be best for.<br />
[table id=241 /]
<h3>Maneuverability and weight</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/maneuverability.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We tested maneuverability around everyday living-room furniture. Weight played a big role in improving the scores of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a>, which also swivels well for quick turns. The Shark &#8211; Apex kept up, though, despite weighing about four pounds more than the budget-priced uprights.</p>
<p>The other surprising results for maneuverability were the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAGRRRU/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; PowerSpeed</a> models. The Dyson ball design just seems stiff and clunky compared to the new swivel-head designs from other makers. And remember, this is a lighter, smaller sibling in the Dyson family.</p>
<p>The Eureka was definitely the most frustrating, though. Without any consideration for swiveling, even the low weight made just turning it around at the end of a hallway far more difficult than it was with the other models.</p>
<p>The dust cups in this roundup were surprisingly similar. Dyson has a slight edge with a one-button release and dump system that makes emptying easier, though figuring out how hard to press the button takes some getting used to. Putting the Dyson&#8217;s pieces back in place is sometimes tricky, too. The other systems also have a drop-away bottom that makes emptying dirt easy, but fiddling with their latches isn&#8217;t quite as elegant.</p>
<p>Dyson&#8217;s outer canister separates completely from the cyclonic separator piece, so it&#8217;s easier to do a deep-clean if something gets lodged in there. None of the other dust receptacles were especially bad at trapping debris, but the Dyson system is (as one might expect) very elegant.</p>
<h3>Under-furniture height</h3>
<p>Measuring the height of each vacuum&#8217;s head gives an idea of how low the base of your furniture can be before the vacuum won&#8217;t fit at all. A model like the Dyson may fit under your couch part-way, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it will actually vacuum underneath. Most upright vacuums are too bulky, so you need to use an accessory tool on the hose to get all the dust bunnies.</p>
<p>Shark&#8217;s powered lift-away system on the Apex has a definite edge here. With the motor body removed, the brush head is free and clear to vacuum in tighter quarters.</p>
<h3>Edge cleaning</h3>
<p>We also tested the ability of these vacuums to pick up along the edge of a room or large furniture that goes to the floor. The Apex was a clear winner on this test, with good pickup right to a half-inch from a baseboard. The other finalists all left a track of dirt more than an inch wide.</p>
<h3>Attachments and Hose Length</h3>
<p>Our testers rated the usefulness of attachments for tricky situations like stairs, couches and drapes. Shark is almost cheating on this score, since the lift-away design means you can attach the handle directly to the motorized brush head to easily vacuum stairs, but the Shark vacuums include useful tools in other respects, too.</p>
<p>Of note is the motorized hand-sized upholstery brush included with the Apex. This kind of tool only works with vacuums that send power through the hose, so it&#8217;s pretty unique on a vacuum that doesn&#8217;t cost $600.</p>
<p>Hose length was a tricky feature to analyze: If you need to vacuum over and under a big sectional couch, for example, it might make all the difference. But the stand-out winner in this category, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAGRRRU/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2</a>, had the hose storage system that was most annoying to work with. Dyson stores a rigid extension tube inside the hose, and it all nestles into the handle shaft, but getting the parts to click into place after use was difficult.</p>
<p>The Shark’s short hose length lost the most points with our testers. The hose on the Apex is only half the length of Dyson&#8217;s incredible ten-foot reach. It&#8217;s easy to lift the Apex&#8217;s body with one hand if you&#8217;re standing on a stepladder to reach a ceiling, but if you&#8217;re going to use the hose frequently you might start looking at the after-market hose extensions offered by other companies.</p>

[table id=243 /]
<p>We ran ten different tests to determine performance on various kinds of carpet and with different types of dirt. We weighed samples of icing sugar, sand and circle-shaped cereal and tested how much each vacuum left behind in a single pass on short-, medium- and long-pile carpet.</p>
<p>The stand-out performance in the pickup tests came from Dyson. If you&#8217;ve got medium- or low-pile carpet and want a deep clean, Dyson does a great job. In those cases it left behind mere grams of material. That said, in long carpet fibers, Dyson offers no height or power adjustment to keep it from simply getting stuck. If you&#8217;ve got luxurious carpet or area rugs, count Dyson out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark&#8217;s Navigator</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> were nearly tied for how much they picked up on shorter carpet. We were especially impressed with the performance of the Dirt Devil, given how inexpensive and light it is.</p>
<h3>Long carpets and area rugs</h3>

<p>The real winner for overall usefulness was the Shark &#8211; Apex. While the Navigator and Dirt Devil performed acceptably well on long carpet in their bare-floor modes, the Apex is the only vacuum in this lineup to offer real suction or brush speed control.</p>

This is the only upright that didn't struggle on area rugs and high-pile carpet.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Dyson and Eureka designs (despite the &#8220;height control&#8221; setting on the Eureka) were impossible to use effectively on long carpet. These vacuums try to gobble up the long fibers with the brushrolls on, and all the suction power pulls the vacuum down into the carpet so you can&#8217;t move.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s even worse if your plush carpet is a small area rug: With a vacuum like the Dyson, you&#8217;ll just get totally stuck or even damage your rug when it gets pulled part-way inside the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Filtration and sealing against dust escape</h3>
[table id=245 /]
<p>For a real test of the filter performance, we used a Dylos air-quality meter to measure particle counts in particles per million by volume, measuring half-micron particles and ten micron particles separately but averaged together here. Readings were taken before and after a vacuuming session, as well as after an additional five minutes running the vacuum to allow its filter to capture particles that had been thrown around.</p>
<p>Sealed-system vacuums performed better than the budget-priced models, though we were impressed at how well the Shark &#8211; Navigator kept up with the more expensive competition, even spreading less dust than its bigger sibling.</p>
<p>The Eureka turned in an impressive result if you only look at the improvement from running the vacuum for five minutes after you finish using it; the amount of dust it spat into the air while it was vacuuming, though, was by far the highest.</p>
<p>These results show that even a well-sealed vacuum that has a good filter will still kick up a lot of dust. <strong>Dust will settle naturally, but it takes a while. You should always vacuum the day before you have asthmatic friends over, not immediately before they arrive.</strong></p>
<p>In our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">pet vacuum review</a> we saw comparable performance capturing smells. The sealed vacuums also performed well keeping pet dander and even odors inside the receptacle. The Eureka performed surprisingly well here capturing dust, much better than it did capturing smells, but there&#8217;s definitely enough variability in our testing environment and the way dust circulates in a room to account for that.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to keep your air as clean as possible, Shark and Dyson do a good job of keeping dust contained. Check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">review of the best room air purifiers</a> if you want to get dust levels even lower than this after you&#8217;re done vacuuming.</p>
<h3>Noise</h3>
[table id=244 /]
<p>After we collected all of the test data on effective cleaning, we booted up our audio-analysis rig to get some noise readings. We used a calibrated mic and the Room Eq Wizard software, set to measure decibels with A-scale weighting.</p>
<p>We took noise measurements from six feet away in a single-car garage bay with a concrete floor. That&#8217;s about double the distance you&#8217;d be at when using the vacuum. We also included two other test vacuums: The tester&#8217;s old Dyson &#8211; DC25 (purchased in 2013) along with the Shark &#8211; Rocket stick vacuum, which won top place in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a>.</p>
<p>The average noise level is quite loud, 85 dBA for just a vacuum motor or 89 with the brushroll engaged and picking up dirt on a hard surface. These vacuums move a lot of air very quickly, so noise is inevitable. For the louder machines, these levels are actually close to what we got in tests from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">review of electric leaf blowers</a>.</p>
<p>The difference between the quietest and loudest vacuum was a full 10 dBA. Because of how sound works, people will perceive that as only double the loudness, but it&#8217;s the same power increase as running nine more of the quietest vacuums in a room together.</p>
<p>The quietest vacuum was the Shark &#8211; Apex, also the most expensive vacuum we tested. <strong>The cheaper Shark &#8211; Navigator was only 1dBA louder, with both vacuums peaking under 87 dBA with the brushroll turned on.</strong> That&#8217;s still loud enough that <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2016/02/08/noise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to guidelines set by the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety</a>, you shouldn&#8217;t be up-close with these vacuum cleaners for more than an hour every day without hearing protection.</p>
<p>All of the other vacuums we tested (including the stick vacuum) were louder than 85 dBA from six feet away. From close-up, as you&#8217;d be using them, the loudest vacuums measured at 97 dBA. You shouldn&#8217;t use a loud vacuum cleaner for longer than half an hour every day without some ear plugs.</p>
<p>This is still much quieter than the noise exposure from power tools at a jobsite, but it&#8217;s something to keep in mind. If you clean for a living and need some hearing protection, check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-ear-plugs/">review of the best ear plugs.</a> Obviously, any of these vacuums are loud enough to wake most roommates (not to mention a baby).</p>
<p>One notable quirk is that while the Dyson is loud overall, its brushroll motor hardly adds any extra noise. Shark&#8217;s powerful brushrolls are quiet, but you can definitely tell when they&#8217;re turned on and off.</p>

<p>At just over $300 from most retailers, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex AZ1002</a> is a premium product that really works to justify the extra cost. This is Shark&#8217;s largest vacuum, and it includes all of the best toys: powered accessory tools, a wood-floor-friendly brushroll, a hair-proof brush cleaning system, an extra-long cord and some working carpet-height settings.</p>
<p>This is the biggest vacuum we tested, though it actually has a fairly narrow cleaning track at 11.5 inches. Compare that to 12 inches on the budget-friendly Dirt Devil or 13.4 inches on the smaller-sized Dyson we tested. Shark tends to focus on maneuverability and flexibility instead of a wide pickup path, and we&#8217;re pretty happy with that tradeoff.</p>
<p>At 16 pounds and drawing 1350 watts of power, the Apex definitely feels like a full-size vacuum when you first assemble it. Most impressive are the power and floor-surface control switches that are mounted on the handle for easy access. No more bending down just to pause to answer the door or move from carpet to hard flooring.</p>
<p>We also noticed the DuoClean brush rollers pulling the Apex across floors more briskly than other uprights. Thankfully, the quick-swiveling head is easy to steer, so we never felt like this was a runaway vacuum. It&#8217;s power you can feel, but you&#8217;re in control.</p>
<h3>Best for thick carpet</h3>
<p>Thick carpet is where this vacuum really shone. Some of the other machines could get you by if you turn off the brushroll to keep it from jamming up, but the Apex gives you just the right amount of suction and brush speed to move swiftly across the floor and effectively clean your carpet.</p>
<p>In our test picking up icing sugar, the Apex was only 20 percent better than the Dyson on long carpet. With sand, though, that difference jumped to an astounding 43 percent. The Apex was also the only upright to earn a perfect score picking up large objects, though the Dirt Devil was not far behind.</p>
<h3>Powered lift-away design</h3>

<p>Shark&#8217;s trademark design innovation is that they don&#8217;t let upright vacuums just be uprights: most of their line also converts to something more like a canister system, with the motor and dust cup in a &#8220;Lift-Away&#8221; pod that detaches from the handle tube.</p>
<p>The Lift-Away design makes the vacuum more flexible than a simple hand tool plugged into a hose could ever be. As mentioned above, since this is a powered Lift-Away model you can use the full-size brush head under furniture, and if you&#8217;re vacuuming a small area with lots of obstacles you can shed all the motor weight for more agility.</p>
<p>The downside of Shark&#8217;s Lift-Away designs has always been short hoses. You run out of hose very quickly if you try to use the Apex like a canister vacuum with the motor unit on the floor, so if you&#8217;re vacuuming a whole room with lots of furniture to clean under you&#8217;ll probably wind up carrying it in one hand while you vacuum with the other.</p>
<p>You can buy a wheeled cart for the canister, and there are non-powered hose extensions you can try, but most of the time it just makes far more sense to use the Apex in its upright mode.</p>
<p>Having too much extra hose can be annoying, and even Dyson&#8217;s remarkable collapsing hose is a bit unwieldy. Maybe there&#8217;s no perfect two-in-one canister and upright vacuum, but we really would like to see at least another three feet on the Apex to say it&#8217;s worth considering as a canister-mode design. For stairs and upholstery, though, it&#8217;s fantastic.</p>
<h3>Also the best upright vacuum for hardwood floors</h3>

<p>The Apex isn&#8217;t a one-trick fish, though. As well as tackling plush carpet, this is the best upright vacuum for bare floors. The Apex brings a few features to bear that you should consider if you&#8217;re vacuuming a hardwood floor rather than wall-to-wall carpet.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s Shark&#8217;s DuoClean brushroll. Many hardwood experts don&#8217;t like using a brushroll anywhere near hardwood, and you could use a vacuum that just has a simple easy-gliding suction head. (You could also use a dust mop.) <strong>But the DuoClean system is an exceptionally soft brush, and it works well to dust and even slightly polish your hardwood or manufactured flooring.</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got sand on your floor, it&#8217;s better to pick it up without grinding it in at all, but most of the time you encounter grains of sand on your floor you won&#8217;t know until you see a scratch. The Apex is, at least, designed to minimize the damage.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top of the Food Chain: Shark - Apex</h3><p>Shark's vacuums are incredibly popular, and this model includes basically every feature they've come up with. Great control means this is actually a good vacuum on all surfaces, and the powered lift-away system makes it very flexible. To top it all off, this is quiet and captures dust effectively.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Another reason this is the best upright vacuum for hardwood floors is that it won&#8217;t choke on your area rugs. None of the other vacuums we looked at in this price range have controls for switching surfaces, so this is the vacuum that does the whole room at once.</p>
<p>We need to stop for a moment here and emphasize that if you&#8217;ve got a new engineered hardwood floor, you should double-check with the manufacturer that use of a soft brushroll won&#8217;t void your warranty. Flooring finishes should all be fine, but care instructions sometimes specifically say not to use a buffing machine or a &#8220;beater bar&#8221; head.</p>
<p>Again, we haven&#8217;t seen any evidence that this vacuum could damage a floor unless you&#8217;re running it through piles of sand and deliberately grinding it into your hardwood.</p>

<p>Shark sells the Apex in a few different versions, but we tested the version that had the best set of accessories, the AZ1002. This model ships with three compact attachments you can plug into the end of the hose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, motorized brush head</li>
<li>12-inch crevice tool</li>
<li>Combination upholstery brush &amp; mattress tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Also remember that the extension tube and the full-size head will plug into the handle, so you can get about 30 inches of extra reach with any of these tools for dusting high-up corners and drapes.</p>
<p>Shark sometimes runs promotions that will include extra accessories, like a flat-surface or under-furniture dusting tool, if you purchase directly from their site.</p>
<p>The motorized pet tool is a good pick if you&#8217;ve got corduroy upholstery or other surfaces that collect hair and need more than just suction to clean. It probably wouldn&#8217;t be worth picking this tool up all by itself if you buy the Apex without it, but it&#8217;s a nice perk and stores neatly on the base of the vacuum.</p>
<p>For stairs and other tricky carpeted surfaces, we think that plugging the handle directly into the regular carpet head and using the Apex like a super-powered handheld vacuum is a fantastic trick. If you&#8217;ve ever skipped cleaning carpeted stairs because you hate how clunky your vacuum is, you&#8217;ll love the Apex.</p>
<h3>Sealed system and HEPA Filter</h3>
<p>The Apex performed very well in our dust collection test. Any powered-brush vacuum will kick dust into the air, so don&#8217;t count on the Apex to make your air dust-free immediately after vacuuming, but the sealed system and HEPA filter will make sure that it&#8217;s not just blowing all the dust you pick up back out into your room.</p>
<h3>A bigger, better vacuum</h3>
<p>To sum up all our time with the Apex: this is a big vacuum that&#8217;s not clunky. Shark has some great tricks that make this a more versatile system than any other vacuum we found. If you have long carpet, area rugs, or any other tasks that utilize Shark&#8217;s special features it&#8217;s an easy vacuum to recommend.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re only vacuuming medium-length carpet, though, both the Shark &#8211; Navigator and the Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet will also do a good job. Those vacuums are lighter, so they&#8217;re easier to use, and they&#8217;re much less expensive, too.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> is a big vacuum, but it’s still easy to handle.</li>
<li>On long carpet, the Apex easily beat all competitors.</li>
<li>This doesn’t quite have as much cleaning power as a Dyson on medium carpets.</li>
<li>Shark&#8217;s powered lift-away design gives flexibility.</li>
<li>Good sealing and filtration keeps dust to a minimum.</li>
<li>The DuoClean brushroll design is also good for hardwood floors.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator NV352</a> earned a second-place ranking based on performance in our tests, but when you consider that it&#8217;s only half the price of the more expensive vacuums we bought, there&#8217;s plenty of reason to consider it best value overall.</p>
<p>The Navigator is a consistent winner in vacuum tests all over the internet. This is a step up from the cheapest vacuums that Shark makes, and a clear step down from their full-featured models. The NV352 doesn&#8217;t have the new hardwood-polishing soft brush, and the version with Shark&#8217;s new maintenance-free &#8220;ZeroM&#8221; brushroll is about $50 more. The lift-away mode won&#8217;t run the brushroll, and there&#8217;s no suction or speed control to make long carpets bearable.</p>
<p>That said, on mid- or short-length carpet this vacuum almost keeps up with a $300 Dyson in our pickup tests for sand and powder.</p>
<p>This is our pick for those whose biggest concern is pet hair pickup, so long as you don&#8217;t have longer carpet. If you do have high-pile carpet, this isn&#8217;t the worst-performing vacuum if you turn the brushroll off, but it&#8217;s not nearly as good as a machine with real multi-surface controls.</p>
<p>Just like the Apex, the Navigator beat the Dyson in both air quality and noise-output tests. It&#8217;s nice to know that for a value-priced vacuum, you don&#8217;t have to make compromises when it comes to your health.</p>

This isn't the very best in any one category, but it's got a strong motor and it's still easy to handle.

<p>If you&#8217;re vacuuming on low-pile carpet or bare floors, the Navigator did spray more sand than the Apex or Dyson. If you spot a pile of sand, you should always turn off the brushroll anyhow, but the Navigator seems to have an extra-aggressive brush.</p>
<h3>Shortcomings</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cerealpickup.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>As you can see in the clip above, the Navigator had trouble in the cereal pickup test, especially on medium carpet. Even on short carpet, where it performed much better, there was a straggler.</p>
<p>In our maneuverability tests the Navigator easily beat the Dyson, but it&#8217;s not as easy to steer as the Dirt Devil. When we asked our tester which vacuum she would most like to keep for her apartment, she passed up the Navigator&#8217;s air filtration and power for the most maneuverable choice.</p>
<p>All in all, there are a few ways the Apex is clearly a better vacuum. The Navigator keeps pace, though, and actually outperformed the Apex in some tests. For most people, this will be a great vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a> is a tried and true value pick.</li>
<li>If your biggest concern is pet hair on mid-length carpet, get this.</li>
<li>Even the less-expensive Shark filters exhaust air even better than Dyson.</li>
<li>The Navigator is almost as quiet as the Apex.</li>
<li>A non-powered lift-away design makes this less flexible than the Apex.</li>

<h2 id="budget-pick">Budget pick: Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</h2>

<p>Dirt Devil&#8217;s lineup of vacuums is very much focused on the budget segment of the market, with few models crossing the $100 threshold. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Razor Pet Steerable Upright</a> is the upgraded model with swivel-action steering, and we think it&#8217;s a great vacuum if your budget is tight.</p>
<p>The Dirt Devil kept pace with the Navigator through the low- and mid-pile carpet tests, so it&#8217;s a vacuum that&#8217;s capable of thoroughly cleaning your carpet. But where it really stood out was in handling. The Dirt Devil is actually slightly heavier than the Navigator, but it&#8217;s easier to maneuver and wheel around.</p>
<p>This vacuum also fits under furniture with a clearance height just slightly lower than the Apex&#8217;s. Without the lift-away feature this isn&#8217;t as versatile in some tight spots, but there&#8217;s something great about a vacuum that&#8217;s just good at what it was built for.</p>

The Razor keeps up admirably on most carpet, and it's pretty good at dust control. You don't get the bells and whistles, but you'll be impressed at how easy this is to maneuver.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For dust control, this vacuum doesn&#8217;t have a HEPA filter or a fully sealed system. It will spread more fine dust around than the Shark or Dyson vacuums. That said, it was surprisingly good at containing the smell and dust from pet hair in one tester&#8217;s apartment. It&#8217;s also slightly quieter than a Dyson.</p>

<p>Dirt Devil includes an air-turbine-powered hand tool with this package, and it&#8217;s the kind of tool that might help in a very few situations, but for the most part you&#8217;ll probably skip it. The Shark&#8217;s motorized brush is wider, and actually has enough torque to get dirt out of carpet or upholstery fibers.</p>
<p>Dirt devil also includes a two-in-one crevice and brush tool for capturing loose objects that fall out of your pockets into your couch. The tools are friction-fit, instead of snapping in place, but they work about as well as most cheap vacuum accessories and store neatly on the side of the vacuum.</p>
<p>One of our testers advocated for a second-place ranking for this vacuum. If you&#8217;ve got a small apartment or a limited area of carpet to clean, this is a vacuum that will get the job done without any pretentious extra features.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> is an easy-to-steer upright vacuum.</li>
<li>If you need competitive cleaning power on a tight budget, here it is.</li>
<li>A low-profile head makes this easier to get under furniture.</li>
<li>The Razor&#8217;s filter and noise reduction won&#8217;t beat Shark, but it keeps up with Dyson.</li>

<p>The Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2 is a powerful vacuum with some great design details, but after spending time with all of the vacuums in this lineup, none of our testers really liked using it.</p>
<p>Dyson products are often tricky to review. When Dyson does something well, they usually do it very well. James Dyson revolutionized vacuum cleaners and has been a dominant force since the DC07 was released in 2001. That said, Dyson has never been very competitive with price, and there are some things about this vacuum that are nearly unforgivable.</p>
<p>At about $300, the Ball Multi Floor 2 is a solid performer. We don&#8217;t want to misrepresent the performance numbers: this is clearly the best vacuum for low-pile carpet if all you care about is deep-cleaning. The track is wide, and the suction and agitation get more dirt out —  on average, the Dyson picked up 95 percent of our test samples on carpets where it will actually move effectively.</p>
<p>Dyson also makes an even more expensive vacuum, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the Multi Floor 2&#8217;s biggest problem. The Ball Animal 2 is supposed to have even more power, but if you have high-pile carpet or area rugs that&#8217;s just like throwing gasoline on a fire. Dyson does not design these vacuums for people with multiple floor surfaces.</p>
<p>The Dyson is a few pounds lighter than the Shark &#8211; Apex, but despite all the ingenuity of the rolling-ball design, this is a difficult vacuum to push around and maneuver. Compared to clunky old commercial vacuums from forty years ago the ball is a great idea, but the new swivel-head competitors are much easier to use. Again, the upgrade model from Dyson would just make the problem worse with a bigger and heavier body.</p>
<p>This might be the best upright vacuum for tile floors, since the hard brushroll doesn&#8217;t matter the way it does on hardwood, and the most important feature is suction power in that case. But it&#8217;s clear that any of the choices from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-steam-mop/">steam mop review</a> would be a better tool for cleaning tile floors.</p>

<p>One strange quirk of the new Ball 2 design that you won&#8217;t see in promotional pictures or even most video reviews is the pressure relief vent at the top of the handle.</p>
<p>When you finish vacuuming and push the Dyson up into its standing mode, the suction switches from the brush head to the handle-mounted extension hose automatically. Air starts rushing in through the cap at the top of the handle.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a bit scary if your hand is on top of the handle when you push it into the standing mode, and it&#8217;s not something we&#8217;d seen on the other Dyson vacuums we&#8217;ve used.</strong> You&#8217;re not going to lose a finger or anything, but it was a turn-off for our testers.</p>
<p>In 2018, Dyson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/06/dyson-announces-cordless-future-with-end-of-plug-in-vacuums" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that they&#8217;re no longer developing</a> new plug-in vacuum designs. We chose their V8 cordless stick vacuum as a top pick in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a>, so we know they&#8217;re on to something, but there are good reasons for many of us to own a conventional upright.</p>
<p>It seems like Dyson never got further than designing around great suction and long hoses. If that&#8217;s your primary concern, then this model or the even more powerful Animal 2 will beat most other vacuums. If you want a vacuum that&#8217;s easy to push and works on other surfaces than low-pile carpet, we suggest looking elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; PowerSpeed NEU180B Upright</a> isn&#8217;t a terrible vacuum. It has good reviews on the retail websites we looked at, with a 4.4 average on Amazon and a good Fakespot grade, as well, so we don&#8217;t suspect those are disingenuous reviews. Many of them seem to be cat owners, so it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re just easy to please.</p>
<p>But about the best thing we can say about the Eureka, in comparison to the other models we tested, is that it&#8217;s very light. Compared to the Dirt Devil at the same price, or the Shark &#8211; Navigator for about $60 more, it&#8217;s just not at all competitive. Not in pickup, not in maneuverability, not in ease of use, not in noise. It doesn&#8217;t even fit under furniture well.</p>
<p>The Eureka is worthless on long carpet. No, a Dyson isn&#8217;t much better, but that&#8217;s not a good excuse when you advertise &#8220;five height-adjustment settings.&#8221; It turns out that the setting just opens or closes the suction opening at the floor very slightly and directs it away from the brushroll. This vacuum did not work on area rugs or carpet with any kind of long pile.</p>

<p>Upright vacuums are tricky beasts. Just about any upright will do a decent job of getting everyday dirt out of low-pile carpet, and so picking the very best means testing for the most extreme cases. It also means we had to be a little bit more picky about likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>After testing vacuums in a variety of real-world settings and comparing them side-by-side in controlled tests, it&#8217;s clear that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> is the vacuum to beat. Good performance on every surface was definitely a winning trait, and creature comforts like handle-mounted switches didn&#8217;t hurt. The powered lift-away design isn&#8217;t everything that a canister vacuum would be, but it&#8217;s pretty darn close for a two-in-one design.</p>
<p>Even with a runner-up pick, it&#8217;s hard not to feel like we&#8217;re short-changing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a>. It&#8217;s small and light, but it packs a lot of power into that compact frame. This value-friendly model is still dust-sealed and quiet, but it doesn&#8217;t have multi-surface power settings or run the brush head in lift-away mode.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something even cheaper, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> is a budget-friendly underdog that keeps up with the pack. There&#8217;s no dust sealing and it&#8217;s not quiet, but it&#8217;s very maneuverable and picks up dirt well.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After testing six of the best pet hair vacuums on the market, we found that the Shark - NV will keep your pet-filled home the cleanest. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver a six-week period we tested the top three upright canister vacuums on the market that are specifically designed for pet hair. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> outshone the others with its powerful cyclonic suction, HEPA air filtration system and superb maneuverability.

<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by checking out websites that are devoted to pet care, such as Rover.com, and other websites that reviewed and made recommendations for the best pet hair vacuum. It soon became obvious that almost none state how they tested the vacuums, and most recommend vacuums for general purposes and not those specifically designed for the challenges posed by pet hair and dander.</p>
<p>We decided to focus on vacuums that either had a special pet hair attachment, such as a mechanized roller brush, or vacuums that were specially designed for vacuuming pet hair. Once we had assembled our list, we narrowed it down to the vacuums reviewed by Amazon consumers as the most effective, durable and easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="six-best">Compare the best vacuums for pet hair</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pet-vac-lineup-b.jpg" alt="lineup of tested pet hair vacuums" width="2000" height="1335" /><br />
[table id=213 /]
<h2 id="who">Who needs a pet hair vacuum?</h2>
<p>Dog and cat owners can probably agree on one thing: their fur baby sheds constantly, and if you allow them on the furniture or in your bed, then you’ve got pet hair everywhere. Pets shed all year round, and many dog breeds have shedding seasons when they lose their top coats and thick undercoats all at once. If you don’t keep up with it, you’ll be suffocating in tumbleweeds of hair.</p>
<p>You could be conscientiously grooming your pet every day, but you’re not just dealing with hair; you’ve got to rid your living space of dander too. For people with allergies, those microscopic flecks of skin will make them miserable if the air is filled with dander. Air purifiers certainly help, but you need a vacuum that can simultaneously suction up pet hair and filter pet dander.</p>
<p>Vacuums, of course, come in many shapes, styles and sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upright bagless canister</li>
<li>Upright bagged canister</li>
<li><a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">Stick vacuum</a></li>
<li>Corded handheld</li>
<li>Cordless handheld</li>
<li>Robot vacuum</li>
</ul>
<p>The vacuum that will be most effective on pet hair will depend on the size of your home and whether you have carpet, hardwood floor or both.</p>
<p>Most vacuum manufacturers advertise that their product is best for pet hair, and some simply stamp a paw print icon on their product’s box to target pet owners. We learned from our research, however, that the differences between a regular vacuum and a vacuum for pet hair are actually pretty minimal.</p>
<p>In fact, when we compared handheld pet hair vacuums with the &#8220;regular&#8221; vacuums in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">our handheld vacuums review</a>, we found that they were notably similar. A pet hair handheld vacuum may have an additional feature, such as a motorized beater-brush like our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07</a>, or a rubber comb, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>Manufacturers claim that a bagged canister vacuum is the most powerful for deep cleaning on a regular basis. But if you’re a pet owner who wants to vacuum every day, it doesn’t make sense to lug one of those around to every room and up and down stairs.</p>
<p>An upright bagless canister vacuum is lightweight, has great maneuverability and is easy to clean. It’s really the best and most convenient for vacuuming pet hair up from both carpeting and bare floor.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Cyclone separation technology:</b> You’ve probably read or heard about “cyclonic” vacuums. Dyson is the most famous vacuum that uses cyclone separation. (Check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/dyson-v7-trigger-vacuum/">Dyson review here.</a>) In brief, it’s a method for creating a rotating high-speed air flow, like a mini cyclone, that sucks everything up into the vacuum. The vortex inside the vacuum canister keeps the pet hair elevated and spinning. Dust and dander are then separated from the hair by centrifugal force and are trapped in an air filter.</p>
<p><b>Air filtration:</b> An air filtration system collects dust and dander from pet hair, and in some cases, freshens the air flowing through the vacuum’s exhaust vents. All upright canister vacuums have a filter made of sponge, foam or ridged fabric. The filters are easy to remove and clean by simply running them through water and squeezing them dry.</p>
<p>A HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter — found in many air purifiers — is often a secondary filter in a vacuum cleaner, and it traps virtually all airborne particles. Of the three upright canister vacuums we tested, only our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> had the additional HEPA filter.</p>
<p><b>Beater brush control:</b> The rotating brush — or beater brush — under an upright canister vacuum whisks up embedded dirt and debris from a carpet, which is then sucked into the canister. Beater brushes, however, are not effective on a hardwood floor, since they scatter more hair and dust than they actually brush up. Look for an upright canister vacuum that has a control to turn the beater brush on and off or raises and lowers it.</p>
<p><b>Special pet hair brush attachment:</b> All vacuum cleaners have attachable accessories, such as brushes and extension wands, for vacuuming drapery, upholstery and tight spaces. Upright vacuums for pet hair also have an extension wand, a brush or two and sometimes an upholstery tool, which resembles a lint roller brush.</p>
<p>Two of the upright canister vacuums we tested — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70355B/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</a> — had a special pet hair brush attachment. It’s about one-third the size of the regular beater brush, so you simply attach it to the extension wand and use it to get in between couch pillows or under your bed. Dirt Devil’s attachment has a rubberized claw, which is excellent for raking up hair from pile carpet.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Test conditions</h3>
<p>Our tester lives in a two-bedroom 1200 square-foot condominium that has approximately 90-percent low-pile carpeted floor. Every two weeks for a six-week period, he tested the vacuum cleaners by allowing hair from his mixed-breed terrier to accumulate.</p>
<p>Each vacuum was tested in a specified area of the condo, each area having both carpeted and marble-tile floors and several pieces of upholstered furniture, where his dog was allowed to sit and nap. If the vacuum was portable, our tester also vacuumed sections of the condo’s fifteen carpeted stairs. All of the handheld pet hair vacuums were tested on the stairs.</p>
<p>Our tester owns a Miele bagged canister vacuum and vacuumed an area as a comparison with the three upright bagless canister vacuums we decided to test. He changed the Miele bag at the beginning of the testing period so its suction power would not be diminished.</p>
<p>For the three handheld pet hair vacuums, he also allowed dog hair to accumulate on his car’s upholstered driver and passenger seats, carpeted floor and rear hatchback area.</p>
<h3>Vacuuming</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/vacuuming1.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Our tester vacuumed each designated area three times with each vacuum over the six-week period. After each vacuuming of the carpets and floors, he checked the beater brush to see whether any hair had been trapped in its bristles. If the vacuum had a special attachment for pet hair, he then vacuumed the upholstered furniture. Finally, using the same attachment, he vacuumed a section of the carpeted staircase.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>During the testing our tester noted the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Maneuverability:</b> Two of the uprights we tested &#8212; the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70355B/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</a> &#8212; had swiveled steering, which allowed easy access in corners and beneath the furniture and bed.</li>
<li><b>Weight: </b>Upright canister vacuums are designed to be lightweight. We tested how much effort it took to push the vacuum and also carry up the stairs.</li>
<li><b>Motorized attachment: </b>Several vacuums have a motorized brush attachment and we determined whether motorizing the separate beater brush was actually more efficient in picking up pet hair.</li>
<li><b>Length of power cord:</b> A longer power cord allows convenient access to multiple rooms from one electrical outlet.</li>
</ul>

<p>After each vacuuming, our tester documented the amount of hair, dust and debris trapped inside the canister and how easy or difficult it was to remove. Unlike a bagged canister vacuum, which does not need its bag changed after each vacuum, a bagless canister vacuum should have its canister emptied and washed every time.</p>
<p>Theoretically the vacuum’s filters should be changed once a year, but presumably that is advisable only if you wash the filters on a regular basis. Our tester noted how much dust each filter collected and washed it to determine its efficacy the next time he vacuumed.</p>
<p>The handheld vacuums were not as easy to clean. It was a challenge removing everything from the compact canister, and the filters were a dusty mess after each use. The Bissell &#8211; 33A1C’s ridged filter was especially troublesome to clean, since pet hair got trapped between the ridges and needed to be extracted by hand.</p>
<h2 id="upright">Best upright for pet hair</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shark-nv350.jpg" alt="Shark NV350" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The most critical thing we can say about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> is that its power cord could be longer. Besides that, this powerful, quiet and nearly perfect upright canister vacuum will make short work not only of pet hair, but also dirt, dust, debris and and anything else you may vacuum.</p>
<p>(The Shark &#8211; NV350 comes in a number of colors, each of which has a different serial number. We tested the lavender Shark &#8211; NV352.)</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; NV350 is marketed as “liftaway,” which means that the canister can be detached from the main chassis to transform into a portable vacuum. This feature allows you to vacuum anywhere within the power cord’s 25-foot reach and get into tight areas and up and down stairs.</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; NV350’s cyclone separation technology and completely sealed HEPA filtration system suck up every last bit of hair and dust. The HEPA filter also freshens the exhaust air from the side vents.</p>
<p>The canister is removed by unlatching top and bottom latches, which completely prevent any debris from flying up and out when you empty it into the trash. Before the testing period, our tester vacuumed frequently with a Miele bagged canister vacuum, so he was shocked when he saw how much more embedded hair and dust the Shark &#8211; NV350 vacuumed up.</p>

<p>If that wasn’t eye-opening enough, our tester vacuumed over the same areas where he tested the Eureka &#8211; NEU180B and the Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B, and the Shark sucked up a half-full canister of more hair and dust.</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; NV350 is lightweight — less than 13 pounds — and has superb maneuverability thanks to its swivel steering and motorized power brush. The power brush can be turned on for carpets and off for bare floors. It took slightly more effort to push the Shark on bare floors, but on carpet, it practically whizzed around the room on its own volition.</p>
<p>The Shark has the usual attachments — crevice tools, a couple of brushes — and also includes a pet upholstery tool, which resembles a lint brush. It’s pretty good at picking up pet hair on furniture, but you need to brush in a downward direction.</p>

<p>Depending on where you purchase the Shark &#8211; NV350, a mini power brush is included (note: the mini power brush is not included with the Shark that is sold by Amazon). It works the same as the large motorized power brush, but it’s about one-third the size, which makes it perfect for stairs and reaching under the bed.</p>
<p>Clean-up is a cinch. The aforementioned liftaway canister makes it easy to empty the vacuumed-up debris into the trash, and it washes clean in seconds. Both foam filters are cleaned by simply rinsing them through with water and squeezing them dry.</p>
<p>Shark offers a five-year limited warranty and a lifetime guarantee for the foam filters and motor belt. The Shark &#8211; NV350 is the most expensive of the three upright canister vacuums we tested, but at $145, it’s still moderately priced for such a high-quality product that outperformed the other vacuums we tested.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight but extremely powerful, the Shark &#8211; NV350 can suction up every last bit of pet hair, dust and debris from both carpeted and non-carpeted floors.</li>
<li>It has excellent maneuverability thanks to its swivel steering and motorized beater brush.</li>
<li>The Shark &#8211; NV350 is one of the few vacuums marketed specifically for cleaning up pet hair that has a sealed filtration system with a HEPA filter.</li>
<li>Its “liftaway” canister turns the vacuum into a portable vacuum for getting into corners, up and down stairs and under furniture.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="handheld">Best handheld for pet hair</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-vac.jpg" alt="Black+Decker - HHVJ325BMP07" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>All three of the handheld vacuums we tested had elements designed specifically for picking up pet hair. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07</a> did the better job of vacuuming dust and dirt as well, thanks to its Smartech auto-sense feature that automatically changes speed and power levels by sensing whether you’re vacuuming carpet, bare floors or upholstery. The auto-sense’s LED indicator also shows battery life and whether it’s time to change the filter.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker is a cordless handheld and is charged by a lithium ion battery for a minimum of six hours. For all of our tests, the charge lasted approximately 18 minutes, which was nearly double the time that the Shark &#8211; SV780 (the other cordless handheld we tested) lasted.</p>
<p>During the period of its charge, the auto-sense did indeed switch speeds when we moved back and forth from carpeting (higher speed), furniture (middle speed) and floor (lowest speed). The charge did dip a bit to about 15 minutes when we kept the vacuum running at its highest speed.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker has very strong suction that lasted during most of its charge, and even when it began to diminish, it was still able to remove stubborn pet hair that clung to car carpeting.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Crevices and Corners: Black+Decker - HHVJ325BMP07</h3><p>The Black+Decker Pet Dustbuster has a long-lasting battery charge and powerful suction. Its unique sensor automatically shifts power levels from carpets to hardwood floors to upholstery.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The vacuum itself resembles a Dustbuster with an elongated nozzle that can be used for vacuuming tight corners and under cabinets. One of the Black+Decker’s excellent features is its beater-brush attachment that slips on to the nozzle. The brush’s alternating rows of rubber bristles and soft rubber tabs prevent long pet hair from getting wrapped and trapped when you’re vacuuming carpeted areas and upholstery.</p>
<p>We were also impressed by how well the Black+Decker sucked up dust from between couch cushions and pillows, which was revealed when we opened up its canister and examined its dual-filter system.</p>
<p>Everything is sucked into the canister where large debris, such as dog hair or cat litter, is separated. Dirt and dust are forced through the filter cup and trapped in the fabric filter bag that’s locked inside the cup. Once vacuuming is done, the filter cup can be removed and the pet hair in the main container emptied without dust flying everywhere.</p>
<p>Two fabric filters are included with the Black+Decker, one of which is scented and perfumes the exhaust air as you vacuum. The “fresh linen” scent is a bit overpowering, but the second filter bag is unscented. As with all handheld vacuums, they should be cleaned after every use. Cleaning is a simple task since the canister and filters can be quickly rinsed and dried.The Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07 is the most expensive of the three handheld vacuums for pet hair that we tested, but thanks to its brush attachment, we found that it was the only one that “powers through pet hair” as advertised. This is a fantastic all-around handheld vacuum you can use for any small area and upholstery.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07 has unique sensing capability that automatically switches power levels from carpet to bare floors to upholstery.</li>
<li>Its lithium-ion battery charges the Black+Decker for a solid 18 minutes, giving you plenty of time to vacuum a number of small areas.</li>
<li>Its power brush is made of alternating rows of rubber teeth and flaps, which prevent long hair from getting wrapped and trapped.</li>
<li>The Black+Decker’s dual filter system effectively sucks up and traps dust and dirt for easy and quick clean-up.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other products we tested</h2>
<h3>Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dirt-devil-pet-vac.jpg" alt="Dirt Devil - UD70355B" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70355B/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</a>, also known as the Razor Pet, is another cyclonic upright canister vacuum and appears to be one of the better made vacuums by this company. Dirt Devil markets the Razor Pet for pet owners by stamping a paw print icon on the box and canister, but it’s otherwise similar to the regular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70350B/dp/B06XDK8Q3B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil Razor</a>.</p>
<p>The only addition to the Razor Pet is its “turboclaw” attachment. It’s a mini beater brush with nine rubber teeth that presumably are designed to rake up hair from a carpet. However, to work properly, the claw must be held at a 45-degree angle so the beater brush can actually reach the carpet. The vacuum has strong suction, so pet hair is lifted up without the assistance of the useless — but cute — turboclaw.</p>
<p>The Razor Pet did an excellent job of consistently sucking up pet hair into neat whirling balls inside the canister. It has swivel steering like the Shark &#8211; NV350, and you can lower the vacuum head so it’s nearly flat (which lets you get under furniture) but we found the steering to be stiff and not very easy to maneuver. In fact, even though the Razor Pet is lightweight, we needed quite a bit of elbow grease to push the vacuum around.</p>
<p>The cyclonic separation works differently in the Razor Pet than it does in the Shark &#8211; NV350. The vortex keeps the vacuumed hair separated and elevated and dust and dirt is forced upwards through a conical foam-covered filter. A latch on the bottom of the canister releases the hair, but the filter must be removed from the top of the canister by unlatching a needlessly difficult lock.</p>
<p>Once removed, the foam is slipped off the ridged fabric filter, which traps hair between the ridges and must be pulled out by hand. A good amount of dust is trapped in the filter, but since it’s not sealed, like with the Shark &#8211; NV350, the Razor Pet cannot capture pet dander. It’s a good all-around vacuum, but it really isn’t a vacuum for handling the challenges of pet hair.</p>
<h3>Eureka &#8211; NEU180B</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/eureka-neu180b.jpg" alt="Eureka - NEU180B" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-NEU180B-Lightweight-Powerful-Graphite/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEU180B</a> is an upright canister vacuum that’s marketed specifically as a pet hair vacuum, but again, in reality, it’s just a vacuum with a lint brush tool. It’s very lightweight, because it seems to be made almost entirely of plastic. One Amazon reviewer wrote that it looks like a kid’s toy, and we have to agree. Even though it weighs only ten pounds, we found it difficult to push around carpeted floors, and it has no steering capability at all.</p>
<p>It has an extra large canister, but it’s not a cyclonic vacuum, so everything blows up into and swirls around the lower third of the canister. Other than a thin piece of foam in the canister, the Eureka doesn’t have an air filter system, so clearly it’s not been designed for pet dander and dust — plus, the exhaust air does not smell clean.</p>
<p>The beater brush can purportedly be adjusted to five levels with a lever, two of which are mysteriously not labeled, but we turned the lever to each level, and nothing moved. Since the beater brush should not be used on a hardwood floor, this is a major design flaw.</p>
<p>For such a noisy vacuum, it doesn’t seem to have much suction power. The ultimate test result was that we vacuumed the same area with the other two upright vacuums, which picked up double the amount that the Eureka did.</p>
<h3>Shark &#8211; SV780</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shark-sv780.jpg" alt="Shark - SV780" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>This cordless handheld vacuum has cyclonic technology, like its upright vacuum, with a built-in beater brush. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pet-Perfect-Cordless-Technology-Rechargeable-SV780/dp/B0037HHFMO/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; SV780</a> is powered by a rechargeable 18-volt nickel metal hydride battery, which lasts longer than alkaline batteries in high-drain electronics. Be that as it may, each time we charged the Shark &#8211; SV780, full power lasted slightly less than eight-and-a-half minutes.</p>
<p>For the brief time that the Shark &#8211; SV780 is at full power, it’s got powerful suction and grabbed up everything in its path, including pet hair deeply embedded in car carpeting. Its side vents are positioned beneath the rubberized grip handle, so the exhaust blows backwards and doesn’t scatter the debris you’re vacuuming.</p>
<p>It has a sturdy bag filter that captures dust and dander, and it’s very easy to clean. It’s a terrific handheld vacuum that does indeed seem like it was designed for pet hair. However, because of its short charge, it just doesn’t give you enough time to clean up anything other than quick little messes.</p>
<h3>Bissell &#8211; 33A1C</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bissell-33A1C.jpg" alt="Bissell - 33A1C" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bissell-Eraser-Handheld-Vacuum-Corded/dp/B001EYFQ28/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; 33A1C</a> is one of the most highly rated handheld vacuums on Amazon. The majority of reviewers cite the low price, and at $30, it’s absolutely the least expensive of handheld vacuums for pet hair. We found it to be very effective on our dog’s bed; it grabbed up every last hair. However, its rubber-teethed mouth doesn’t really rake up the hair, and we had to go over the bed several times before all the hair was picked up.</p>
<p>It’s corded, so it has limitations as to where you can vacuum. We found the vacuum especially challenging when trying to clean the car, since you need an outlet nearby that can accommodate its cord.</p>
<p>The vent exhaust is close to the head, so for anything other than hair, the exhaust air blows it around. The Bissell’s tapered mouth allows you to vacuum in tight spaces, but the spaces in the rubbered mouth are so small that it really can’t pick up much besides pet hair.</p>
<p>Finally, cleaning the filter is a pain, especially if you have a pet with long hair. The Pet Hair Eraser has a ridged fabric filter, which traps long pet hair and can only be removed by picking it out with your fingers.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There’s clearly a lot of competition in marketing a vacuum to pet owners, and at first, it can be daunting to decide which type of vacuum you need and then whether it really can do as advertised. You could certainly spend a month’s rent on a very high-end vacuum, but we focused our research and subsequent testing on reasonably priced upright and handheld vacuums that were designed specifically for vacuuming pet hair.</p>
<p>The best upright bagless canister vacuum for pet hair was unquestionably the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a>. Its swivel steering and motorized beater brush give this lightweight vacuum excellent maneuverability, so you can get under furniture and into tight corners. The Shark &#8211; NV350 has a dual air filtration system with a HEPA filter, which eliminates virtually every speck of dust and dander on your carpets and floors. It also has a canister that can be removed to transform it into a portable vacuum that’s perfect for going up and down stairs.</p>
<p>Our pick for the best handheld vacuum for pet hair is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07</a>. It’s a cordless handheld and its charge lasts 18 minutes, giving you plenty of time for rapid clean up of small areas. The Black+Decker’s automatic sensor shifts power levels automatically when you move from carpets to bare floors to upholstery. It’s more expensive than other handheld vacuums, but it really does the job that others didn’t in our tests.</p>

<h2 id="difference">The difference between a handheld and car vacuum</h2>
<p>Car vacuums are similar to handheld vacuums in terms of portability, but they are specifically designed to clean the interior of a car effectively. You <i>can</i> use any <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">handheld vacuum</a> to clean your car, but car vacuums are specifically designed to allow you to get into tight spaces, with specialized attachments for spaces between and underneath your seats, behind your pedals and in door pockets. Plus, most car vacuums will come with brushes to clean dust in the air vents and console spaces without leaving scratches.</p>
<p>Car vacuums also need to be powerful enough to get all kinds of dirt. Think stubborn sand from the beach, mud and rocks from hikes, ground up crumbs compliments of your toddler or hair left behind by your beloved pet. We chose to test dedicated car vacuums or handheld vacuums that have attachments specifically designed for your vehicle.</p>
<p>So who can use a car vacuum? If you have kids or pets, a car vacuum is a must-have. If you clean your own car, or want a handy instrument to keep your car spotless in between professional cleanings, a car vacuum is for you.</p>
<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are many car vacuums available, so we spent hours narrowing down the best on the market.</p>
<p>We checked out subreddits, considered the findings from reviewers like Wirecutter and automotive websites, as well as vacuum specialty sites. Once we had input from the car and vacuum professionals, we were able to determine which features consumers value the most in a car vacuum. We found that consumers and car detailers alike consider power to be the most important factor in choosing a car vacuum. Other considerations are battery life and run time (for cordless models), and ease in reaching narrow spaces in a vehicle.</p>
<p>Based on our research, we looked for car vacuums that met our key metrics, such as a powerful suction, thanks to a strong motor and adequate air watts, strong battery and useful attachments to get to hard-to-reach dirt. For cordless vacuums, we looked at models with lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries (as opposed to NiCd batteries) because Li-ion batteries have higher power density, resulting in longer lasting power. We also considered customer feedback on the vacuums and filtered out any models that seemed to have recurring issues.</p>
<p>With these details in mind, we selected eight finalists to review. Over the course of six weeks, we put them through a series of tests to judge their performance and ease of use.</p>

<p>Considering whether you need a cordless or corded vacuum? It really all depends on your circumstances. If you are cleaning your car in a garage with an AC outlet nearby, a corded vacuum may be for you. You don’t need to think about charging the vacuum, nor do you have to worry about the vacuum losing power as the battery loses its charge (this is a complaint many consumers have voiced about battery-charged vacuums). Corded options often (but not always) boast more powerful suction. Corded versions come in sizes small and large (like the Armor All), whereas cordless models tend to be more compact.</p>
<p>If being tethered to an electrical outlet sounds like an inconvenience to you or you plan to use your vacuum on the go, a cordless model may be more suited to your needs. You can use the cordless vacuums essentially anywhere, but unlike the corded option, you do need to remember to keep it charged. In our testing, we found that cordless vacuums made it easier to get into the deepest places in our cars without a cord getting caught in the car door or on a tire. The cordless options we tested gave us plenty of time to clean one car. With close to 20 minutes of running time, the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot allowed us to get most of the way through cleaning a second car before we needed to recharge it.</p>
<p>As a third option, some car vacuums, such as the Baabyoo, plug into the 12-volt outlet in your car. This makes the vacuum super convenient for cleaning your car and offers a consistent power source. However, 12V outlet functionality limits you to using the vacuum only in your car.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3><b>Suction power</b></h3>
<p>Power is key to ensuring that you have enough suction to get the job done in a timely manner. Who wants to vacuum the same mess over and over again to get it cleaned up? Different manufacturers measure power in different ways (amps, air watts and/or air flow). We looked at cordless vacuums that ranged from 15 to 35 air watts, which refers to the amount of watts it takes to carry a unit of air through the vacuum, as well as corded vacuums with motors that boasted at least 4 amps.</p>
<h3><b>Attachments</b></h3>
<p>Consider all the nooks and crannies in your car, from between the seats and the door side pocket to the heating/air vents that collect dust. You need a vacuum that can get to all of them.The attachments on a car vacuum are very important since you need to clean many different areas and materials — from plastic and burl wood, to leather, fabric and carpeting. Did each vacuum have a tool to get in between seats and a brush clean the console without leaving scratches?</p>
<h3><b>Wet/Dry vs. dry</b></h3>
<p>Wet cleaners have a trap for water so that you won’t damage the electrical components of the vacuum while sucking up wet messes. Standard (dry) vacuums don&#8217;t have that protection, so they can short-circuit if you try to suck up moisture. Whether to select a wet/dry vacuum or dry-only vacuum depends on your needs and what kind of messes you deal with on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<h3><b>Tank capacity</b></h3>
<p>Tanks will vary in size, meaning that you may need to empty the tank more or less often. We found that all the car vacuums we tested had sufficient tanks to clean your entire car, even with significant dirt, sand and food crumbs. If you have a space for a larger machine like the Armor All, it boasts the largest tank of all the vacuums we tested (at 2.5 gallons).</p>
<h3><b>Weight/Size</b></h3>
<p>It’s important that car vacuums are lightweight and convenient, so we considered whether any of the vacuums were too large, heavy or unwieldy. The vacuums we tested ranged from the light Baabyoo, weighing in at 2.5 pounds, to the heaviest of the group, the 7-pound Armor All.</p>
<h3><b>Battery runtime</b></h3>
<p>For cordless vacuums, how long can you run the vacuum before you need to recharge? Most batteries will power the vacuum consistently for about 10-15 minutes total, so will that be enough to get through cleaning your entire car before it turns off? With turning it on and off as we worked through our cars, we found that this is typically enough time to get the job done. Our top choice, the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot, lasted closer to 20 minutes and it didn’t lose much power. That’s because it is powered with a 20-volt lithium battery.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Suction</h3>
<p>The suction of a car vacuum is key. To test each one, we spread an eighth of a cup of sand on the same car mat and counted how many passes it took to clean up the mess. We also tested cereal crumbs with each machine and then generally worked around the car to suck up residual dirt and dust on and in between the seats, on the floorboard, behind the gas and brake pedals, and in the console and air conditioning vents.</p>
<p>We found that all the vacuums were able to tackle the messes pretty well, but some just did so more efficiently. We found that sand was the most challenging debris for the vacuums to fully clean, so this became our key comparison test. The Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot cleaned sand in just two to three passes, whereas some others took five to seven passes to fully get the sand up from the car mat.</p>
<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p>We also tested the attachments on each vacuum to see how well worked in a car. All the vacuums we tested had brush and extension attachments, which are essential to fully clean your car.</p>
<p>Several of the machines including the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot, the Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L and the Dirt Devil have the crevice tools and brushes attached. This means that you don’t need to go searching for attachments, which adds to the machines’ convenience. You can just flip the tools up or down depending on what area of the car you need to clean.</p>
<p>Several other vacuums we tested have hose attachments that connect with the body of the vacuums and then stretch into the car for cleaning. These vacuums are effective as well, though it sometimes takes a little more maneuvering to get the body of the vacuum situated in a place that allows you to get the hose and connected attachments where you need to clean in the car.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>Ease of use can mean a lot of things — for example, how comfortable is the vacuum to use and how convenient are the attachments to use? How easy is it to get to the spaces you needed to clean — sometimes at awkward angles?</p>
<p>Based on our testing, we found that cordless vacuums are easiest to navigate in and around our cars. The cords on the corded vacuums can get caught on the car tires and in the doors as you reach into our car.</p>
<p>With that said, we found that vacuums with the longest cords provide a better cleaning experience than those with short cords. At 18 feet, the Bissell has the longest cord, which makes a huge difference in allowing you to access all the places you need to vacuum in a car. The Armor All has the shortest cord of the group (only 10 feet), which means that in most cases, an extension cord is needed.</p>
<p>We also looked at how the collection bins and filters worked on each of the vacuums and determined which were the most difficult to disassemble and clean. Most were fairly straightforward once we figured out how the vacuums opened. We had a bit of concern about the Armor All. While it worked well to clean spills — including wet and dry messes — you have to switch out the filter for wet versus dry material. It’s not difficult, but if you forget to switch the filter out, you can short out the motor.</p>

<p>By the time we finished our testing, the leader of the pack was quite clear. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOEFBKS/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot</a> had the strongest suction at 35 air watts and did the best job on tough dirt and sand.</p>
<p>Its wide mouth was effective on car seats and mats, while the attached crevice tool and brush allowed us to conveniently get into the smallest crevices in the car. The pivot design made it so that the vacuum could clean at odd angles, which minimized the craning and stretching we had to do. We found it much more comfortable to clean with than the fixed nose of the Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L model.</p>
<p>We love that the crevice tool and brush, which can get to hard-to-reach spaces, is attached to the machine. You can also purchase an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DP737HW/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">additional Car Accessory Kit</a>, which includes a flexible hose that stretches up for 4 feet, large brush attachment and storage bag. While the vacuum itself has an attached brush attachment that we found more than adequate, these extra attachments might come in handy for the most fastidious car owner.</p>
<p>This model is a battery-powered product, which in the end, we felt was most convenient for cleaning a car. The vacuum’s power stayed strong for about 20 minutes before it needed a recharge. This was plenty of time to clean the car effectively without feeling the need to hurry.</p>

<p>While this vacuum boasts strong power and convenience, it also has a three-stage filtration system to help trap allergens. The Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot also boasts a translucent bagless dust collector so that you can see the dirt you have captured, and how much space you have left before needing to empty it. We found that the dust collector had plenty of space left over after we finished our vacuuming sessions.</p>
<p>When we cleaned out the vacuum’s collection bin, the process was straightforward. You can simply empty the contents into the trash, or depending on the mess you just cleaned up, you can also wash the plastic in the sink to get it fully clean. Once you are done, the vacuum can also be folded in half for convenient storage.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The pivot design on the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot helped us get into corners and odd angles of a car. The vacuum was also ergonomic and comfortable to use.</li>
<li>It cleaned sand and other dirt with the least amount of passes, thanks to its powerful suction.</li>
<li>The battery lasted as long as we needed it and did not lose power along the way.</li>
<li>The machine has plenty of capacity for dirt, was easy to clean out and has a triple filtration system to ensure that you aren’t breathing the dirt and dust you are trying to clean.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our favorite car vacuum with a cord was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KCMH7A/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell</a>. It provided strong suction with a 4-amp motor and effectively cleaned up the sand we spilled in just three passes. It was the only vacuum we tested with a rubber attachment, which makes capturing pet hair easier.</p>
<p>We loved that the Bissell is effective in cleaning <i>all </i>parts of a car. Its wide suction area is great for car mats and seats, while its hose and attachments allow you to get into the nooks and crannies. This is unlike some of the other vacuums we tested, like the Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L, which has a narrow opening, making it take much longer to thoroughly clean the mats and seats in a vehicle.</p>
<p>The cord on this model is 18 feet, which makes a significant difference in accessing all areas of the car. It is significantly longer than the other options we tested, including the shortest cord of the pack, on the Armor All, measuring in at only 10 feet. If you have a garage with an AC power outlet that is accessible to your car and you don’t want to have to worry about charging your car vacuum before using it, this model is an excellent option. It also has a cord wrap system for convenient storage.</p>
<p>Not only is it powerful with a conveniently long cord, but the Bissell also has a large collection bin so that you can clean your car multiple times without having to empty it. The section of the vacuum that collects the dirt is clear, so you can see when it is getting full. It pops off easily for emptying. This vacuum also boasts a HEPA filter, which is important for cutting down on allergens that you may breathe in while vacuuming your car.</p>

<p>At 4.7 pounds, this model is a little heavier than some of the other options, including our top pick, the Black and Decker -BDH2000PL Pivot, which is only 3 pounds, but it still felt comfortable to hold while we cleaned. Because this model has a hose that attaches to the vacuum body, you can use the hose with attachments throughout your car, without having to constantly move the base of the vacuum.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bissell &#8211; Cleanview Deluxe provides strong — and consistent power — to take care of even the biggest messes or the most stubborn dirt.</li>
<li>The wide suction area is great for seats and mats in your car, while the attachments do a good job in the hard-to-reach areas.</li>
<li>You don’t need to worry about charging the battery before use.</li>
<li>The collection bin was roomy enough to handle several cleaning sessions without having to be emptied.</li>

<p>Editors note: The item we originally tested was the Vacplus, which has been out of stock since November. We found an identical rebrand of it from a company named Baabyoo, which we&#8217;ve replaced mentions of Vacplus throughout the article with.</p>
<p>At a budget-friendly price, we liked the functionality of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTYLV9G/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baabyoo</a>, which plugs into the 12V power outlet in your car. This was one of the more compact vacuums of the group we tested, but it packed plenty of power to clean sand, crumbs and more. If you experience wet and dry messes in your car, this is a great option for you, as it will seamlessly handle either type of spill.</p>
<p>We found the power on the Baabyoo adequate to get the job done and because it plugs into a 12V outlet in your car, you don’t have to worry about periodically needing to charge it. In addition to trying this vacuum on sand, we cleaned wet mud from the car and found that it did well on wet messes, which makes it a good option for those who often find themselves at the beach, on hiking trips or those with children who are spilling milk or juice. If a spill or mess happens while you are away from your home or on a road trip, you can still use the vacuum without needing a wall outlet or battery charger.</p>
<p>In addition to offering consistent suction, this vacuum has several attachments that are very effective in reaching between car seats and capturing dust in car consoles. All the attachments fit with the vacuum in a nylon zipper bag, making storage of this model in your car or trunk simple and convenient.</p>
<p>We found one user that had a problem with the attachments staying attached, but he reported back later on that the company saw the review and replaced his defective unit.</p>

It’s powered by your vehicle’s DC V12 power outlet, which means you don’t need to worry about charging it before use.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTYLV9G/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Cleaning the machine — even with wet messes — was straightforward. The collection bin pops off and can be rinsed with water and soap when needed. The collection bin is not clear, on some of the other models like the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot, Holife or Bissell models, so you do have to check from time to time to ensure that you haven’t filled the vacuum with dust.</p>
<p>A drawback of this machine is it can <i>only </i>be powered by a 12V outlet. If you want to use your car vacuum for other spills from time to time in your garage or elsewhere, you may want to consider a traditional corded vacuum model or one with a dedicated battery charger.</p>
<p>As our budget selection, this vacuum is priced around $20. It offers a great bang for your buck if you wish to keep a dedicated car vacuum in your vehicle.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Baabyoo provides strong and consistent power to clean your car, using the 12V outlet in your vehicle.</li>
<li>It cleans up wet/dry messes.</li>
<li>A convenient nylon bag comes with the vacuum for storage.</li>
<li>It is the most budget-friendly option at around $20.</li>

<p>We loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00445L290/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carrand</a> for its attachments, which were very clearly designed for the car — more so than any of the other car vacuums we tested. It even has an attachment to buff the console. It also has several attachments to clean cup holders, air vents and the console without leaving scratches.</p>
<p>This vacuum had very strong suction, taking care of our sand test in just two passes. The Carrand is bulkier than some of the other options. The vacuum itself sits on the ground, with a hose to reach into your car for cleaning. Since this is a corded model, you are tethered to your garage’s AC outlet. The length of the cord is on the shorter side at 12 feet, so an extension cord might come in handy depending on how close you can get your car to your power outlet.</p>
<p>The machine blows warm air, which the company describes as a minimal resistance design that allows air to ﬂow more freely for more cleaning power. We didn’t have any problem with the air flow — it did not seem to cause allergies, but those who are very sensitive to dust might want to take this feature into consideration.</p>
<p>The main drawback we found with this particular model is the storage for the attachments, which is at the side of the base of the vacuum. As we reached into the car to vacuum a seat, the movement of the hose knocked the attachments loose onto the garage floor. Even despite the attachment storage issue, anyone who is concerned about getting every possible nook and cranny of their car will still want to consider the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00445L290/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carrand.</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYVDGFK/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holife &#8211; Hand Vacuum Cleaner</a> is a strong contender in the car vacuum arena. It is easy to use and picks up all kinds of dirt with ease. We were able to tackle the sand we spread out as part of our testing, as well as cereal crumbs and even a few stray chips in the car, thanks to the large suction opening. The large opening also made it possible to vacuum our car mats and seats efficiently.</p>
<p>The attachments for this model are not connected to the vacuum itself but they are easy to connect and they allow you to reach the smaller spaces of the car. The machine is relatively light, so it made maneuvering through the car easy.</p>
<p>The dirt and debris that you pick up shows through the clear collection bin so that you can see when you need to empty it. Emptying the bin took a little bit of figuring out with several pieces to disconnect, but once we figured it out, the process wasn’t too cumbersome. The Holife can handle wet and dry messes and the collection bin can be washed out with soap and water to clean up after cleaning wet messes. The vacuum comes with two washable filters, which is great because you can reuse them over and over.</p>
<p>While the vacuum picked up all kinds of dirt effectively, we did notice that that the Holife seemed to lose some of its suction as the collection bin filled up and the battery wore down.</p>

<p>The largest of the models we tested — the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003M2F7NI/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Armor All </a>— will hold plenty of dirt and grime in its 2.5-gallon container. During our testing, it proved powerful enough to aptly pick up dirt, cereal and dust in the car. The attachments also allowed us to dirt in between our car seats effectively. It also handled wet spills like water and mud.</p>
<p>This vacuum is significantly larger than most of the vacuums we tested, with the exception of the Carrand. The garage where we tested this machine is tight on space and we found it difficult to move the vacuum around the car in the limited space. It was easier to pull the car out into the driveway and use an extension cord (the cord that comes with his machine is quite short at only 10 feet long).</p>
<p>While we found this hard to use in tight spaces, if you have a large garage or need a small shop vac that will double for cleaning your car, this is a great option. If you are only looking for a convenient car vacuum, there are other smaller options, such as the corded Bissell or the cordless Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot, which we felt were easier to maneuver and had just as strong suction. If you need a small wet/dry vacuum, the Baabyoo or Holife are also solid contenders.</p>
<p>While we found that this works well to clean wet and dry spills, you have to switch out the filter for wet versus dry material, which can be a bit of an inconvenience. It is something to be aware of because if you forget to swap the filter before cleaning up a wet spill, you risk shorting the motor.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002D47XOM/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Scorpion</a> is one of the more budget-friendly options in the group of car vacuums. It has a streamlined design which is comfortable to hold, though the machine felt heavier than some of the others. It is also very loud.</p>
<p>The power of this vacuum was acceptable. Because it is corded, you don’t need to worry about ebbs and flows of power. The cord measures 16 feet, which is long enough, though we had to do some maneuvering at times during our testing. In terms of suction, it took about four passes to collect the sand we spread out and did a good job on crumbs as well. The crevice tool worked in between the seats, and we liked that it was connected, so we didn’t have to go looking for the right attachment.</p>
<p>After some use in our car, however, we turned the vacuum back on and it sprayed out a burst of dust that hit us in the face. While we liked other aspects of this car vacuum, this turned us off to this model entirely. We checked to see if other reviewers experienced the same and we found several who wrote about this problem, blaming a poorly constructed filter.</p>

<p>We expected the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006LXOJC0/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L</a> to be one of the easiest vacuums to use and liked that it was light and compact. However, we were disappointed with its power and overall effectiveness in cleaning a car. The long “nose” of the machine made it more difficult to get at different angles in our car. Also, because the nose doesn’t have a wide opening, it takes longer to clean the larger sections in our car, such as seats and mats.</p>
<p>While some of the other machines took care of the sand we spilled in the car in just two to three passes, we found that this model was not as effective. Despite repeated passes of the vacuum, we could never quite get all the sand out of the floor mat with this model.</p>
<p>While the power was lacking on this model, we did like that the Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L has an attached brush to easily clean the console and dusty areas of the car without scratches. Still, it was just not as effective as the other machines actually capturing all the dust.</p>
<p>Another feature on this model that we liked is that the lithium battery charger automatically shuts off when the battery is charged. This is a great safety feature and it also allows you to conveniently store the machine on the charger without worrying about draining the battery. But in the end, the lack of suction and design flaws for cleaning a car made this our least favorite of the car vacuums we tested.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There are many variables when it comes to choosing a car vacuum. Do you want a cordless or corded model? Do you need a vacuum that can also work on wet spills? These decisions will depend on your garage set-up and what messes you’ll typically be cleaning up.</p>
<p>After testing eight of the top car vacuums, we feel that the cordless models are the most convenient to use in a car. While the batteries don’t last forever, we found that most of the models we tested last long enough to get the entire car clean before needing a recharge.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOEFBKS/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot</a> is our favorite model when it comes to power, ergonomic design and effectiveness in picking up even the most ground-in dirt. During testing, the pivot design allowed us to comfortably get to dirt in hard-to-reach spaces. It has a crevice and brush tool attached, which is convenient as you are working through your car, and both tools did a good job getting at dirt and dust. In addition, if you want additional attachments, you can purchase them as add-ons, giving you the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>We also feel confident recommending the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KCMH7A/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell</a> if a corded car vacuum fits your needs. This model is sturdy and powerful. Its wide mouth is effective on seats and mats, while its attachments do a great job with dirt in the deepest crevices of a car.</p>
<p>And last, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTYLV9G/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baabyoo</a>, which plugs into a car’s 12V power outlet, is our budget pick, which as a bonus, can handle both wet and dry spills.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent three days testing six of the top rust removers on the market on a variety of rusted tools, household objects and doors to determine which was superior. Ultimately, we selected <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0044F9Q52/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Out &#8211; Stain Remover</a> as the best rust remover. Iron Out is simple to apply in spray-gel form, acts quickly, and for some surfaces — like rusted chrome — works to restore products to almost showroom condition. Our runner-up is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U0GIKQU/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CLR &#8211; Calcium Lime Rust Remover</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Rust is the common name for iron oxide, the combination of iron and oxygen expressed as chemical compound Fe2O3. The process of how rust works involves an electrochemical reaction involving an anode, cathode and electrolyte. For those of you who skipped chemistry class, the first two are pieces of metal that give and receive electrons, and the last element is a liquid that helps the electrons move.</p>
<p>For our review, we began by identifying highly rated products from consumer and specialist sources and then screened product reviews for authenticity. We focused on rust removal products that are convenient to use, have a wide range of applications and minimize use of toxic chemicals. Our finalists were chosen based on three factors: the best for metal, the best spray and the best liquid.</p>
<p>Of the three rust removal techniques — mechanical, conversion and direct application — all of our products fall into the last category.</p>
<p>In very broad terms, household rust removers are designed to work in one or two simple applications. They can be divided into products that are intended exclusively for metal and  products with a wider range of applications such as vinyl, ceramic tile, fiberglass and even carpet and fabrics. We sought out the best representatives for both these categories.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-rust">Types of rust</h2>
<p>While rust conditions might all look alike to the untrained eye, there are subtle differences in the nature of how rust occurs, even within the confines of a small tool like a wood plane. An ideal sample of different types of rust includes four variations: stable rust, flash rust, flaking rust and pitting.</p>
<p><b>Stable rust:</b> Occurs over long periods of time and tends to be uniform in appearance. In certain cases, like uncoated steel building panels, stable rust is considered to be a desirable aesthetic effect.</p>
<p><b>Flash rust:</b> Results from water occurring at one spot. Flash rust is frequently bright orange in color and can occur in as little as six hours.</p>
<p><b>Flaking rust:</b> Can actually take up more volume than the metal it displaces and is often found in transitional areas where a coating ends.</p>
<p><b>Pitting: </b>Results from trapped moisture and is commonly found in the cavity areas of tools and furniture.</p>
<h2 id="common-methods">Common methods for removal</h2>
<p>Rust removal is a broad topic that includes a wide range of techniques for cleaning metal and other materials where surfaces have become tarnished, stained and tainted with oxidized metal (aka rust). Dealing with rusted metal objects and surfaces can be addressed with three basic techniques:</p>
<p><b>Mechanical methods:</b> Grinding, sanding and scouring.</p>
<p><b>Conversion methods</b>: Preventing the further spread of rust by using chemical solutions to convert the rust into a protective barrier.</p>
<p><b>Direct application:</b> Soaking, spraying or wiping a removal product onto the surface.</p>
<p>In addition to metal, the word “rust” is commonly used to describe discoloration from hard-water stains and reactive stains that appear on nonmetallic surfaces such as porcelain, stone, wood, brick, concrete, fiberglass and vinyl. The rusty stains in bathtubs and toilets are common examples of nonmetallic rust.</p>
<p>The reality of rust is that it is tricky to figure out. Many household items have patches of rust intermingled with painted or other coatings. This was the case with the steel table that we tested. It had painted legs with the paint worn off in patches and with rust in-between. Our overall experience with the four (only four of our six were used on the table) rust removal products was that most of them darkened the rusted area but did not affect the paint. For heavy duty cases like this, a more labor-intensive process using a paint-stripper and/or a chemical rust remover is required.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>Home rust removers are packaged and applied in a variety of ways. The most common applications are sprays, gels and liquid (i.e., immersion) forms. Apart from considering the effectiveness of the product in question, we also delved into the features that consumers find most important.</p>
<p><b>Form of application: </b>Rust-removal products come in spray, gel and immersion form. The most convenient products are those that can be sprayed on the rust. Although spray-on application is easy, it can still be tricky knowing how much spray to use — but here’s a tip: The position of the rusted item is important. If you are spraying a vertical surface, the spray drips down the face, and it can be difficult to apply the product evenly. The best way to deal with this is to spray just a bit at a time and work it in as you go.</p>
<p><b>Toxicity: </b>This was a key consideration in our product selection. Toxicity relates to both the impact on the individual applying the product and to the disposal of the product in the environment. <b>We avoided products with oxalic acid, a comparatively abrasive and harmful chemical.</b> Instead, we focused on products that did not require respirators and special handling, although we did use gloves to avoid direct contact with the skin during application (and we recommend that you do too). Some products, like Iron Out &#8211; Rust Remover, warn that burns can occur that might not immediately be felt. It is advisable that extra care be taken when using any rust-removal product.</p>
<p><b>Odor: </b>Most of the products we tested had a fairly mild odor or no odor at all. If you are sensitive to odors, it is advisable to wear a respirator and safety glasses when applying rust removers. Since the products we tested were selected in part for being relatively environmental-friendly and nontoxic, none of the manufacturers recommended wearing a respirator during application.</p>
<p><b>Duration of application: </b>The recommended time for application is noted on all products. For some products, there is a different prescribed time that depends on the severity of the rust and the type of surface treated. Of the products we tested, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M0TLQ66/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evapo-Rust &#8211; Super Safe Rust Remover</a> had the widest range of recommended application times.</p>
<p><b>Effectiveness based on a single application: </b>For household use, a single application is desirable. Since even the simplest application of a rust remover entails a certain amount of care, mess and clean-up, no one wants to go through multiple applications to achieve a good result unless it’s absolutely necessary.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>

<p>The first part of removing rust from household products is to assess the type of rust you’re dealing with. Stable rust and pitting rust are the most common forms found in a home. We tested our products on tools, surfaces and appliances to determine the best overall performer.</p>
<p>All rust products, even the simplest spray-on products, require a reasonable amount of preparation to protect your hands and eyes. We tested a range of product types, including sprays, gels and liquids and found ourselves liking the sprays the best for ease of applications.</p>
<p>After reviewing product instructions and optimal applications, we identified six products that provided a sufficient range of surfaces and types of rust. Not all products are created equal, so we targeted a minimum of four surfaces for each product. The six finalists can be broadly grouped into metal-specific products and nonmetal products for treating surfaces such as ceramic tile, vinyl and fiberglass.</p>

<p>The test surfaces included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steel work table (stable rust in patches)</li>
<li>Garden tools (power washer nozzle, shovel, weeder and rakes; included a mix of stable and pitting rust)</li>
<li>Nuts and bolts (pitting rust)</li>
<li>Teapots (water stains)</li>
<li>Chrome chair legs (stable rust)</li>
<li>Stainless steel refrigerator (water stains)</li>
</ul>
<p>The products were applied according to instruction. Where a range of application times was given, we used the midpoint time. Where possible — for example, on the work table — we applied simultaneously multiple products to compare performance. For other rusted objects, such as workshop tools, we applied each rust remover separately.</p>
<h3>Outdoor furniture and tools</h3>
<p>Old tools never die, they are just left outside to rust. Rust and associated stains can be found everywhere: Tools, surfaces, bikes, cars and furniture are common victims. Most rust is treatable to some extent, and fortunately, there are excellent household products to help get the job done.</p>
<p>Our steel work table presented the biggest challenge. None of the four products we tested on the table did an effective job in cleaning the table legs. Even Evapo-Rust &#8211; Super Safe Rust Remover, which was left applied overnight, did not have much of an impact on the table legs (other than to darken them somewhat).</p>
<p>The table was our most “industrial” representative with heavy-gauge steel and a painted surface that was likely applied electrostatically. Heavy-duty products with painted or coated surfaces will typically require a two-step approach that requires removing the finished surface first and then applying the rust remover. We tested our products on the table to see if they would improve the overall rusted appearance without it turning into a major project.</p>
<p>Our garden-tool category was a bit of a mixed bag. We used four tools with stable and pitting rust: a shovel, a weeder and two rakes. The Evaporust, probably due to it being a liquid for which total immersion is possible, took most of the rust off the weeder’s tip after it was partially immersed in a bucket. We also applied Aceros &#8211; Innosoft B570 to our rusted shovel with a wet sponge as recommended. It did a credible job of cleaning the rust from the shovel and giving it an overall darkened appearance.</p>
<p>One area where all our finalists “shined” was removing pitted rust off nuts and bolts. With very small objects, complete immersion is quite practical. We saturated paper towels and then rinsed and wiped down the nuts and bolts. While all the products did an excellent job, the WD-40 &#8211; Specialist Rust Release Penetrant Spray was perhaps a bit better, pretty much as we’d expected from a product that touts nuts and bolts as a specialty.</p>
<p>Our two rakes were so heavily rusted that it was hard work for the two products we tested on them, CLR and Iron Out. Both products darkened the rakes, but the metal remained rusty. CLR, which we applied at full strength, narrowly outperformed Iron Out on this test.</p>
<h3>Indoor appliances and housewares</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Iron-Out-clip-sm.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Moving indoors, we tested our products on common appliances: a refrigerator, a stainless steel tea kettle and a steel pour-over kettle. For the refrigerator, we selected the four products that matched the assignment: Innosoft, Iron Out, CLR and Star brite. We divided a zone of the water-stained refrigerator door into four distinct areas and applied our products per manufacturer instructions.</p>
<p>Once again, Iron Out &#8211; Rust Stain Remover Spray Gel performed the best, bringing back a nice shiny surface and removing the water stains almost entirely. CLR &#8211; Calcium Lime Rust Remover also did an excellent job polishing out the water stains.</p>
<p>We then checked back in 48 hours to see if there was any “ghosting” or residual markings where the original stains had occurred. The presence of such marks would suggest that the rust-removal products had worked topically but had not penetrated the surface. Very little ghosting was evident from the sections treated with Iron Out and CLR. Star &#8211; Brite and Innosoft also worked fairly well on the refrigerator but did not quite restore the shine as much as the other two products.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">The best overall: Iron Out &#8211; Stain Remover</h2>

<p>We were delighted to find that one of the spray products performed very well across the board. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0044F9Q52/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Out &#8211; Stain Remover</a> proved the best for a variety of surfaces, and it was particularly impressive at restoring our vintage chair’s chrome legs to almost showroom condition. It also quickly removed water stains from the door of our stainless steel refrigerator.</p>
<p>Iron Out’s packaging states that it’s specialized for bathroom, kitchen, carpet and fabric stains, along with chrome and other surfaces. Combined with its stellar performance on chrome, we liked how Iron Out readily applies as a spray and wipes off after only a minute or two. With nearly 1,000 positive Amazon reviews, we were not alone in thinking that Iron Out is an excellent choice for a household rust remover.</p>
<p>With Iron Out, you get the best features of all our rust removers: simple application, speedy results and the versatility to treat different surface types. Since it is a spray gel, Iron Out is simple to apply to vertical surfaces, and does not drip excessively.</p>

<p>One slightly tricky thing about Iron Out is that the product instructions recommend wiping it off after a few seconds. In our experience, an application of between 60-90 seconds was optimal. It also helps to use a bit of elbow grease to achieve the best results. We obtained good results using it to remove rust stains on the front of a stainless steel refrigerator door, but we had to scrub vigorously and then leave the product applied for a minute or so.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Iron Out sprayed on easily with very little overspray, and it was easy to wipe clean.</li>
<li>It yielded positive results in a matter of minutes, as compared to some other products that require hours of treatment.</li>
<li>Iron Out produces very little odor.</li>
<li>We got spectacular results on the rusted chrome legs of a vintage chair.</li>

<p>One thing to look out for with rust products is the manufacturer’s recommended uses. The word “rust” tends to be applied to a broad range of surfaces besides metal, including some surprising materials like fabric. We appreciated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U0GIKQU/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CLR &#8211; Calcium Lime Rust Remover</a> quite a bit, as it comes in liquid form and can be diluted to the appropriate strength as required by the job.</p>
<p>It is recommended that CLR be diluted with 50-percent water, but it can be used full strength on more stubborn stains. For our tests, we used CLR at full strength. CLR proved a consistent performer. It worked best on nuts and bolts and shined up the front of our stainless steel refrigerator nearly as well as our top pick Iron Out &#8211; Stain Remover.</p>
<p>CLR is a product that is more appropriate for surface rust stains like those found inside toilet bowls, tile grout and the calcium deposits found on shower heads and faucets. We liked that it can be used full strength for items like nuts and bolts, but can also be diluted into a more household cleaner for appliances like the refrigerator we tested.</p>

We liked how easy it goes on and sponges off, and it works in a matter of minutes.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U0GIKQU/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Another thing we like about CLR is that it is an EPA Safer Choice product, plus it has a pleasant citrus-like odor. CLR comes in liquid form and is packaged in a plastic jug. You need to transfer it to another container like a small plastic tub if you plan to dilute it, or to apply it to a surface like a shower head. If you use it full strength, you can simply use a sponge or rag and hold it to the mouth of the jug; but in our experience CLR works best when the item can be fully submerged.</p>
<p>Like all of our tested products, CLR was easy to clean up with paper towels or a sponge, and it left little or no residue.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>CLR &#8211; Calcium Lime Rust Remover is Intended for rust stains on metal, concrete and other household surfaces.</li>
<li>CLR can be applied either by submersion or surface application.</li>
<li>You will typically want to dilute with water for ordinary stains, but it can also be applied full strength for tougher, hard-to-get-out stains.</li>
<li>It does not contain oxalic acid or other harsh chemicals, and we found it to have a pleasant citrus odor.</li>
<li>CLR is an EPA Safer Choice product.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Aceros &#8211; Innosoft B570</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JG0HDLO/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aceros &#8211; Innosoft B570</a> is something of a strange product. Touted as an “organic” rust remover, it contains sodium alkyl sulfonate, which can cause serious eye damage. In that sense, the “organic” label is misleading in that it suggests the product cannot be harmful.</p>
<p>Innosoft B570 is fairly simple to apply, but the surface should be horizontal since the gel can run down in a goopy mess if you’re not careful. For the more heavily rusted products we tested, such as our garden tools, Innosoft B570 didn’t quite have enough oomph to effect any change with a single application.</p>
<h3>Evapo-Rust &#8211; Super Safe Rust Remover</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M0TLQ66/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Evapo-Rust &#8211; Super Safe Rust Remover</a> is touted as an “amazing rust eliminator,” but it was just an average performer in our group, working best on our rusted weeding tool. It works best on items that can soak for the recommended one-to-twelve hours. On the plus side, Evapo-Rust is nontoxic, biodegradable and does not contain any acids.</p>
<h3>Star brite &#8211; Rust Stain Remover</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000AY4QY/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Star brite &#8211; Rust Stain Remover</a> is closer to an overall household cleaning product than a specialized rust remover. One of its principal uses is for cleaning fiberglass surfaces such as boats. In our testing, it worked decently on nuts and bolts and also performed fairly well at removing rust from our teapot. Star brite is a spray-on rust remover. While we did not have the chance to test Star brite on a boat, it is frequently mentioned in public forums as an effective boat cleaner.</p>
<h3>WD-40 &#8211; Specialist Rust Release Penetrant Spray</h3>
<p>WD-40 is a familiar brand to many people for its household lubricant spray. We tested its sister product <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00631GQGW/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WD-40 &#8211; Specialist Rust Release Penetrant Spray</a> and loved how it can be applied in very tight spots. It worked incredibly well to stop a garage door from squeaking, and it aptly cleaned up our nuts and bolts. The drawback of this WD-40 product is that it cannot be conveniently applied to large rust patches or to irregular surfaces like teakettles.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to supplement a general purpose rust remover with a product that specializes in loosening rusted nuts and bolts and eliminating squeaky hinges, then we highly recommend WD-40 &#8211; Specialist Rust Release Penetrant Spray.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>An easy-to-use, nontoxic rust remover is a great item to have around the house to help with everything from unsticking locks, to improving the appearance of tools and equipment, to restoring metal and other surfaces to almost new condition. We tested six rust removers in gel, liquid and spray form to determine ease of application and effectiveness of results.</p>
<p>Our favorite overall product was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0044F9Q52/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Out &#8211; Rust Stain Remover Spray Gel</a>, which worked extremely well on a rusty steel refrigerator door, a teakettle, as well as nuts and bolts. Another incredibly convenient product, WD-40 &#8211; Specialist Rust Release Penetrant Spray has a long nozzle designed to penetrate rusty tool parts and locks that need to be freed up. We think keeping both of these fairly inexpensive products around is a great idea.</p>
<p>The runner-up was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U0GIKQU/?tag=ybdrust-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CLR &#8211; Calcium Lime Rust Remover</a>, which is effective on a variety of surfaces. However, as a liquid, CLR can be more difficult to apply than a spray, gel or spray gel, especially to vertical surfaces where it will drip down.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent 30 hours on research and four months of in-house testing before choosing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748TR6Q1/?tag=ybdv7-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger</a> as our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/" rel="noopener">best handheld vacuum</a>. The point-and-shoot design, easy handling and incredible suction power made the Dyson our go-to handheld vacuum. While there are other handheld vacuums with cyclone technology, we found the Dyson picked up the most fine dust and large debris of all the finalists we tested.</p>
<p>British engineer and designer Sir James Dyson started developing cyclone technology in 1978. Five years (and over 5,000 prototypes) later, he had invented the world’s first bagless vacuum cleaner. Dyson&#8217;s cordless vacuums have become so popular, they&#8217;ve actually stopped developing new plug-in vacuums. As the most expensive handheld vacuum on the market, we wanted to know if the V7 lived up to the hype.</p>
<p>Over the course of several months, we put vacuum through a series of tests to judge their performance and ease of use. We also put each model to task on a variety of daily cleaning jobs, such as vacuuming up cereal from car seats and sand from our front door mat. The Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger is the latest release of their handheld vacuum, and our in-house testing confirmed that Dyson lives up to its reputation.</p>

<p>Compared to the other finalists, the Dyson offers the most convenience. It is portable, lightweight and easy to maneuver. The Dyson is ergonomically designed to fit comfortably in your grip and to spread the weight across your whole hand.</p>
<p>Power and suction are arguably the most important part of a handheld vacuum. And simply put, the Dyson was easier to use and more powerful than the other handheld vacuums we tested, making faster work of our cleaning projects. The lithium-ion battery can be fully charged in 3.5 hours and runs for as long as 30 minutes. Comparatively, the other finalists took between four to eight hours to fully charge, and lasted between 12 and 30 minutes.</p>
<p>While not even lithium-ion batteries are truly “fade-free”, the Dyson suffered minimal power drop when we tested it at the 90% discharge point (minutes away from a completely dead battery). Our other finalists with lithium-ion batteries did not fare so well.</p>
<h3>Cyclone technology</h3>
<p>The Dyson can collect smaller particles than other finalists we tested, thanks to a unique two-tier cyclone system that we’ll explain in a minute. The difference was notable on our floor and upholstery, and also when we emptied the dustbin. The dust was finer in the Dyson than in any of the other finalists, indicating that it was pulling up dust and dirt to a higher degree than its counterparts.</p>
<p>Dyson’s cyclone technology uses two tiers of 15 cyclones to generate a centrifugal force that can create a powerful upward sucking motion and can capture microscopic dust. Once vacuumed into the chamber, the first tier of cyclones creates a vortex that spins at about 200 mph and flings large particles out of the cyclone into a dust-collecting cup. <b>The second tier of cyclones, tucked inside the first, creates a cyclone that can reach 900 mph, which can spin out and collect dust particles as small as 0.5 microns.</b></p>
<p><b>For comparison, a single strand of human hair is 50 to 70 microns in diameter.</b> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency places <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particle pollution</a> into two categories: inhalable particles 10 micrometers and smaller (such as dust, pollen, mold) and fine inhalable particles 2.5 micrometers and smaller.</p>
<p>Smaller particles can get deep into your lungs, and some may even get into your bloodstream. We also <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">reviewed the best air purifiers</a> that can help control fine dust in your home, but collecting as much fine dust as possible in your vacuum is definitely your best bet.</p>
<p>The other advantage to a vacuum using cyclone technology is a strong suction power, and therefore cleaner floors. The downside is that these types of vacuums are generally sold at a much higher price point.</p>
<h3>Dyson digital motor V7</h3>
<p>Most cordless machines use brushed DC motors that spin around 25,000 rpm. The motor of the Dyson &#8211; V7 uses a digital pulse to propel a magnetic rotor that can reach 110,000 rpm. To give you an indication of how fast this is, a race car engine moves at 19,000 rpm. The end result of the high speed is more powerful suction, so you can clean more effectively.</p>

<p>We tested our handheld vacuums for several months before determining a winner, and Dyson (a company that is always working on new products and technology) released a newer model of their handheld vacuum during the time we were working on our article. We originally reviewed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GXFIS5A/?tag=ybdv7-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; V6 Trigger</a>, and when the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748TR6Q1/?tag=ybdv7-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger</a> arrived on the scene, we tested the newer model as well.</p>
<p>Testing both models over a period of months gave us an in-depth familiarity and understanding of the Dyson handheld vacuum. With that knowledge, we felt comfortable recommending the Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger as our number one handheld vacuum. It outperformed the other seven finalists in terms of power, runtime and ergonomics. Here’s a rundown of how the Dyson compared to the rest:</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>One of the aspects we found frustrating with other handheld vacuums that we tested was that emptying the waste bin necessitated pulling out the filter, making it a dirty job. <b>Thus, the Dyson’s hygienic one-touch bin emptying was a favorite feature of ours, as it drives out dirt and debris with one action</b>. It was also simple to remove, wash and replace the lifetime filter.</p>
<p>It is lightweight, only 3.8 pounds, and ergonomically designed. <b>The trigger fits flush to the handle of the machine, so that the load is shared across the whole hand.</b> This puts less pressure on the wrist and fingers, and makes it easy to use for an extended period of time. Compact and portable, we found it the easiest of our handheld vacuums to grab and go.</p>
<p>It has a clear dustbin with a 0.15-gallon capacity, so you can actually see the amount of fine dust it captures, and hygienic one-touch emptying so that you don’t have to touch any of it. In the case of dirtier jobs, such as vacuuming a mattress, we found this to be a pretty key feature.</p>
<h3>Power and suction</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12980" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data.png" alt="power testing data" width="2000" height="1936" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data.png 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data-610x590.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data-768x743.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data-885x857.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data-1500x1452.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data-295x286.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data-1000x968.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data-360x348.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data-375x363.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data-414x401.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data-320x310.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/power-testing-data-885x857@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We can tell you that the Dyson generates up to 100 air watts of suction on MAX mode, but we’d rather spell it out in terms of actual cleaning capability. <b>The Dyson can suck up a Cheerio from an inch and a half away, and can suction at least 16 ounces of weight.</b></p>
<p>While it’s not likely that you’d wish to vacuum up something that heavy, it is a good indicator of how well the Dyson performs. It was excellent at removing sand, debris and dust from both hard floors and carpets, which we tested using cereal and dry oatmeal.</p>
<p>We put the Dyson to task on staged tests such as baking soda ground into short pile carpet, as well as real life messes. Of all the finalists we tested, the Dyson was the most capable at picking up debris and dust. Not only could you clearly see a difference on the floor and upholstery, you could see an incredible amount of fine dust in the waste container; much more than we originally assumed was on the floor.</p>
<p>The run-time enhancing, light-touch trigger means that battery power is only used for cleaning tasks. The Dyson allows you to save seconds and minutes of battery life by shutting off the second you release the trigger. Not only does the battery run longer than its counterparts, battery power isn’t wasted between cleaning tasks.</p>
<h3>Sound</h3>
<p>We used a sound decibel meter to measure and record the amount of decibels when held one inch from the motor. The Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger measured at 89 dB, making it the quietest handheld vacuum we tested. This is an improvement on the Dyson &#8211; V6, as it measured 7.9 dB louder. The V7 has been acoustically engineered to reduce volume and improve sound quality over its predecessor.</p>
<h3>Runtime and charging</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12979" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data.png" alt="charging and runtime data" width="2000" height="1860" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data.png 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-610x567.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-768x714.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-885x823.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-1500x1395.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-295x274.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-1000x930.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-360x335.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-375x349.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-414x385.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-320x298.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/charging-runtime-data-885x823@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The Dyson gives you 30 minutes of runtime in Powerful mode and 6 minutes in MAX mode. MAX mode gives you even stronger suction for those particularly challenging areas; we found it especially helpful to pick up debris in heavy traffic areas like the front-door floor mat. <b>We cleaned a car</b> <b>using a mix of Powerful and MAX mode as necessary, which gave us about 18 minutes of runtime and was ample to complete the task</b>.</p>
<p>Rather than having to balance the Dyson on a charging stand, you simply plug it in to the power cord. We appreciated this no-fuss charging as much as we appreciated the fast recharge time. <b>The Dyson recharges in only 3.5 hours, faster than any other handheld vacuum we tested. </b>Since it suffers only minimal power loss on a low battery, you can still use it before the 3.5 hours is up. It will run for a shorter period of time, with nearly the same level of power as a full charge.</p>
<h3>Pet hair</h3>
<p>In addition to making fast work of removing pet hair from a Golden Labrador’s favorite resting place (a canvas pet bed trimmed with piping), we could see in the waste bin that the Dyson picked up fine debris that was likely pet dander. We used both the stubborn dirt brush and the mini motorized tool on this task. <b>The mini motorized tool was better able to agitate and loosen embedded hair, since it has smaller bristles to catch fine hair and fibers as well as direct drive action.</b> When pet hair does get caught in the brush bar (unlike the rubber nozzle of our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/#runner-up" rel="noopener">top pick for pet hair</a>), the brush bar slides out so you can easily clear obstructions.</p>

<p>The Dyson &#8211; V7 features the new quick-release connectors for easy attachment and removal. Three accessories (the combination tool, crevice tool and mini motorized tool) are included in the purchase price, and additional attachments can be purchased separately. In addition to the included accessories, we tested the mattress tool, stubborn dirt brush and extension hose.</p>
<h3>Combination tool</h3>
<p>The less you have to carry, the better, when you’re multitasking around the house. The <a href="https://www.dyson.com/support/journey/spare-details.967482-01.227594-01.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">combination tool</a> offers a two-in-one attachment, with a dusting brush (we used it on both keyboards and window blinds) and a wide mouth crevice tool.</p>
<h3>Crevice tool</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dyson.com/support/journey/spare-details.967612-01.227594-01.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">crevice tool</a> is good for narrow spaces and was particularly useful on car seats to suck up spilled snacks. Getting into tight spots (such as a car seat) sometimes necessitated an awkward turn of your arm or whole body to get the correct angle and most suction.</p>
<h3>Stubborn dirt brush</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dyson.com/support/journey/spare-details.967765-01.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">stubborn dirt brush</a> has coarse bristles to agitate and loosen dirt from sturdier carpets and door mats. Gaps in the bristles make it easier to push across surfaces. We found it a little too rough for the flooring in our car (it made it a little fuzzy), but it was great for an outdoor floor mat.</p>
<h3>Mini motorized tool</h3>
<p>You can get an even stronger pickup with the <a href="https://www.dyson.com/support/journey/spare-details.967479-03.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mini motorized tool</a>, but be aware you’ll get a slightly shorter runtime (25 minutes as opposed to 30). When you combine this tool with MAX mode, you can accomplish some tough tasks. Even in Powerful mode, it was excellent at removing pet hair and ground-in dirt.</p>
<h3>Mattress</h3>

<p>Dirt, dead skin cells (a favorite snack of dust mites) and allergens can collect on your mattress surface. Gross, we know. So we <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/mattresses/how-to-clean-a-mattress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep cleaned</a> our full-size mattress with the mattress tool by using it to cup the seams and to slowly glide along the surface of the bed on MAX mode for six minutes. It picked up one gram of debris and was not a pretty sight, but we were thankful it was no longer on the surface of our sleeping area.</p>
<p>We had previously used the mattress tool with the Dyson &#8211; V6, and while we did not weigh the output the first time, we were surprised how much debris had already accumulated in a few short months.</p>
<h3>Extension hose</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dyson.com/support/journey/spare-details.967490-01.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">extension hose</a> gives you an extra 23 inches to reach up high, deep into cabinets or underneath car seats. We especially liked that it folds back up into a short length for easier storage.</p>

<p>The Dyson &#8211; V7 was clearly the best handheld vacuum we tested, but there is one significant downside: the cost. It was nearly double the cost of our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/#runner-up" rel="noopener">runner up and best handheld vacuum for pet hair</a>. Budget-conscious consumers might balk at purchasing a handheld vacuum for the same price as a capable upright vacuum, which are typically better at deep-cleaning carpets. The Dyson &#8211; V7 does come with a two year worry-free warranty, and knowing your handheld vacuum has lasting power may help justify the cost.</p>
<h3>Keeping up with the latest release</h3>
<p>Similar to Apple’s iPhones, Dyson’s ongoing releases may have you feeling like you are always behind the times. As Dyson releases new lines, you may be able to get a deep discount on previous models that have been redesigned. On the other hand, you won’t have all the improvements that come with a newer model.</p>
<p>Even when lines are discontinued, you can still get help for your older machine. Dyson continues to offer support on nearly all of their models, even the original Dyson released in the U.S. (2001), the DC07.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Despite a high price point, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748TR6Q1/?tag=ybdv7-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; V7 Trigger</a> would be an advantageous tool for households that prize convenience, need power and would use a handheld vacuum regularly. Namely, we would recommend the Dyson for households with kids and furry pets. Its portability, strong suction and maneuverability make it a cleaning tool that can handle the constant messes that come with crumb-dropping children and fur-babies who shed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter weeks of researching and hands-on testing eight of the top stick vacs available, we feel confident recommending the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K7L8U62/?tag=ybdstick-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Rocket HV382</a> as the best stick vacuum with a cord and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IENFJ14/?tag=ybdstick-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; V8 Absolute</a> as the best cordless option. While a bagged upright vac is still a better choice for heavy-duty carpet cleaning, even the most meticulous person can appreciate the level of clean these two models will bring to a household.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>In order to find a lineup of stick vacuums to consider, we first had to find out who is best served by a stick vacuum and what types of cleaning tasks they hope to accomplish. We consulted an excessively tidy community on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LaundryLoveandScience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laundry Love &amp; Cleaning Science</a> Facebook group, where science-backed data reigns and “vacuum recommendations” and “carpet cleaning” are the hottest topics. This group favored lower-priced corded models, providing feedback on our budget picks, but also had strong opinions on which vacuums are worth the splurge.</p>
<p>In addition to doing in-depth research for our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/" rel="noopener">handheld vacuums post</a> previously, we also scoured through amateur reviews and posts by neatnik consumers on blogs, subreddits like r/VacuumCleaners and Amazon. Finally, we rounded out our data with input from professional reviewers like Wirecutter and Consumer Reports. This helped us narrow down the most-desired features in stick vacuums.</p>
<p>From there, we devised a series of rigorous tests that satisfied our inner geeks and helped us come up with a more objective basis for choosing our winners. During the testing phase, we vacuumed our rugs, carpets, upholstery and hard floors, then used the attachments on curtain blinds, inside the cupboards and even the walls.</p>

[table id=116 /]
<h2 id="stick-vacuums">Stick vacuums vs. traditional upright vacuums</h2>
<p>When it comes to versatility and reach, stick vacuums are the cleaning tool of choice. They are lightweight and flexible, making them ideal for quick pick ups (think animal cracker crumbs, pet hair and the potato chip bits that follow your roommate around).</p>
<p>The majority of the models we tested can convert into cordless handhelds and/or lie flat, allowing you to clean spaces that are typically awkward for an upright model to clean. A stick model makes it more convenient to clean under furniture and fit into small spaces like behind the toilet or inside cupboards.</p>
<p>Since they take up less storage space, these are well suited for the fastidious college student or for small businesses to use in between their regular cleaning service. Although stick vacuums are making advancements, they are still less powerful than upright vacuums.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of square footage (such as a large home or business) or only want to invest in one cleaning tool, your best bet is to stick with an upright vacuum. However, if you already have a full size vacuum for deep cleaning and are looking for a supplemental cleaning tool, a stick vacuum is handy to have.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Low profile:</strong> Upright vacuums rarely lie flat, so it’s one of the features that make a stick vacuum stand out. The lower the profile, meaning how flat it lies to the ground, the easier it is to reach further under furniture. Since stick vacuums tend to be a supplemental cleaning tool, it’s helpful if they reach places that are hard to clean with a traditional vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>Swivel steering:</strong> This feature gives you more control, making it easy to maneuver around furniture and other obstacles. Fewer than half of our finalists have this feature, but agility makes a big difference on your arm and ability to get into tight spaces with ease.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-functional:</strong> As a supplemental cleaning tool, a stick vacuum adds extra value if it is able to convert into a hand vac and/or comes with attachments. The last thing you want to do is go get yet another cleaning tool when you’re trying to finish multiple tasks at once.</p>
<p><strong>Power:</strong> We already mentioned that you won’t get the deep cleaning associated with an upright vacuum, but that doesn’t mean you want a wimpy model. Newer models continue to outdo themselves when it comes to more powerful suction on carpets and hard floors.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life / run time:</strong> If you know you want a cordless stick vacuum, you’ll want to consider how long it runs before you need to recharge and how long it takes to recharge. A fast recharge and longer run time is the ideal combination in a cordless stick vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>Unit size:</strong> If you’re purchasing a stick vacuum because you have limited storage, the upright dimensions of the unit are key. For instance, the Dirt Devil &#8211; SimpliStik has a width comparable to a broom or mop, while the BISSELL &#8211; AirRam has the width and depth of a traditional upright vacuum. Smaller dimensions makes these vacuums easy to keep in a corner for quick pick ups. On the other hand, a wider head allows you to cover more square footage more quickly, while a narrower head allows you to fit into tight spaces. The width you need depends on the type of job you want to accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>Safe on delicate floors:</strong> One of the convenient things about a cordless stick vacuum is that you can easily move from room to room without searching for a new outlet. It’s nice to know that you can move from carpet to wood floors to tile or linoleum without scratching delicate surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Noise:</strong> This may not matter as much if you plan to vacuum in a dorm room or bustling office, but a quieter vacuum is nice when you have kids or pets who may be sensitive to loud noises.</p>
<h2 id="corded-vs">Corded vs. cordless</h2>
<p>Since cordless models run on batteries, they tend to be less powerful and have a shorter life span. Additionally, they can suffer from a battery “memory effect,” more accurately referred to as voltage depression. A corded vacuum gives you constant suction power, so there’s no concern about how long you can run it. If you have a lot of square footage to cover and don’t want to wait for a battery to recharge, you might want to go with a corded model.</p>
<p>On the other hand, cordless stick vacuums are highly convenient. There’s no need to worry about cord length or dancing with the cord. Since run times can vary from 20 to 40 minutes, they tend to be better for smaller spaces such as dorm rooms, studios and apartments. Choose a model with a good charge time to run time ratio, i.e. one that charges for fewer hours and has a longer run time.</p>
<p>In the end, the choice between a corded or cordless stick vacuum comes down to lifestyle, how large your space is and the types of cleaning jobs you need to accomplish on a regular basis.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>Our practical testing involved a house with young children, both carpet and linoleum floors and a heavily trafficked rug in the living room. While accomplishing daily (or even more frequent) cleaning tasks such as removing Cheerios, dried Play-Doh and debris from foot traffic on the floors, we first considered the ergonomics and ease of use.</p>
<p>Is it easy to push around the room? How is the grip? Is it heavy to lift when taking it out of the closet and storing it again? Can it easily convert to a handheld to quickly pick up debris along the edges of walls and furniture? What is the waste emptying process like? These are the types of questions we asked as we put each finalist to use on typical cleaning jobs.</p>
<p>Since the Berber carpet and linoleum floors we used for testing tend to be hardier than hardwood and laminate floors, we also checked reviews to verify details on scratch-susceptible flooring before deciding on our winners. Some products were less hardwood friendly, such as the Hoover &#8211; LiNX and BISSELL &#8211; AirRam, where consumers reported scratches. The Dyson &#8211; V8 Absolute is the only model with an interchangeable brush roll designed specifically for hard floors, made of soft woven nylon and anti-static carbon fiber filaments.</p>
<h3>Dust emissions test</h3>

<p>We wanted to know whether the vacuums were actually picking up or just kicking up dust and debris, so we conducted an emissions test with a Dylos air quality monitor. The Dylos measures indoor air quality in small and large particle counts. By testing before and after vacuuming, we were able to compare the numbers and ascertain whether there was a high amount of dust kickback.<br />
According to <a href="http://www.svcvacuum.com/bagless_mant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Southside Vacuum Company</a>, dust kickback can occur when the dirt container is too full, large items clog the vacuum, or the height adjustment is set incorrectly. Therefore, we made sure to take all these points into consideration before conducting our test. However, even a vacuum that is functioning properly can throw around particles that won&#8217;t be caught in the filter.</p>
<p>You need a sealed HEPA filter like the Dyson &#8211; V8 Absolute to fully capture the finest dust and dander, which meets the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ehss/high-efficiency-particulate-air-hepa-filter-test-facility-ftf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States Department of Energy</a> standards by capturing 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 micrometers.</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; Rocket HV382 exceeded expectations on this test and also left the air cleaner than when we began. It has two pre-motor filters (foam and felt) and a post-motor filter, so it was able to capture more small particles. All of the remaining vacuums produced kickback of varying degrees, with the BISSELL &#8211; 38B1 blowing back the most dust.</p>
<p>We set the Dylos on a flat surface slightly above the floor and took a test reading to get our base counts. We took a new base reading for each vacuum as the counts can vary over a period of days and weeks.</p>
<p>For each test we vacuumed a large area rug, making sure it was free from large debris, that the height settings (if available) were set correctly and that the dirt container was empty. After vacuuming for approximately five minutes, we turned on the Dylos and took a second reading with the vacuum still running.</p>
<h3>Suction test</h3>

<p>As we used each finalist on general house cleaning tasks, we noted the efficacy on both hard flooring and carpet. Since a stick vacuum is not a deep cleaning tool, we judged efficacy by the ASTM F2609 standard. This standard applies to the removal of litter clinging to the surface of a floor, rather than how well it removes embedded dirt.</p>
<p>To test suction power and design, we sprinkled cereal and then rice on both hard floors and carpet. We gave each finalist 30 seconds to vacuum up the litter, taking note of whether it pushed the larger debris out of its path or if we needed to maneuver the vacuum by lifting the head for better suction.</p>
<p>Sand is prevalent in San Diego (where we conducted our tests), but it is not always visible on light-colored carpet. To give a more clear indication of efficacy on small particles, we used blue kinetic sand made of baking soda, baking powder and Dawn dish soap. Then we followed the same steps as the litter test to see how well it cleaned the floor.</p>
<p>For the units that converted into handhelds, we conducted an additional test to measure power. Holding the vacuum nozzle above the floor, we slide the unit downwards until it sucked up cereal and recorded that distance in inches.</p>

<p>Many consumers who purchase a stick vacuum as a supplemental cleaning tool to their full size vacuum do so because they fight a daily battle against pet hair and other pet-related debris. We all know that once pet hair lands on carpet or upholstery, it never wants to let go.</p>
<p>To determine how well our stick vacuums removed embedded pet hair, we put them up against a clowder of cats. Healthy cats shed constantly, even those of the shorthaired variety. In a home where four cats reside (one longhaired and three shorthaired rescue cats), the carpet under the bed in the master bedroom gathers a prolific amount of pet hair, dander, cat litter and other unpleasant messes.</p>
<p>Since the cat hair was not visible on the light carpet, we gave each finalist 30 seconds to pick up as much hair and debris as it could, making sure to vacuum a new section each time. We considered whether the vacuum was able to capture cat litter embedded in the carpet divots, how clean the floor appeared and felt after vacuuming and whether or not hair was getting stuck in the brush roll or making it all the way to the waste bin.</p>
<p>After vacuuming, we emptied the waste canister and used a kitchen scale to determine which finalist was the most effective at removing embedded hair from the carpet. While there were potential variations in the amount of hair on the carpet in each area, the weight found in the waste bin was consistent with our qualitative data.</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; Rocket HV382 picked up an impressive 14 grams of pet hair using the pet multi-tool, and thanks to easy access to the brushroll, it was simple to remove the hair after vacuuming. The exposed brush roll design (no front wall) meant that it easily sucked up cat litter, rather than pushing it forward and leaving a line of debris against the wall.</p>
<p>The Dyson &#8211; V8 Absolute was a top contender here, sucking up 11 grams of pet hair with very little getting caught in the brushroll. With a low profile that lies flush to the ground, it was the best at reaching under the bed without moving the mattress.</p>
<p>It should be noted that after testing with all seven of our stick vacuums, we finished the job with an upright Dyson DC 40 and still managed to pick up deeply embedded hair. However, for the more moderate one or two pet household, an ability to capture 14 grams of pet hair should prove more than adequate.</p>
<h3>Sound test</h3>
<p>Usually a noisy vacuum means a more powerful motor, but sometimes it just means a louder motor. Since some people can be sensitive to noise, we measured sound by holding a decibel meter an inch away from the motor and recording the max decibels.</p>
<p>To give you an indication of comparable noise levels, we clocked a portable electric fan at 68.1 dB and a refrigerator motor at 78.8 dB. At 89.8 dB, the Electrolux &#8211; Ergorapido is the quietest of the stick vacuums we tested. The Dirt Devil &#8211; SimpliStik was the noisiest, at 101 dB. Generally speaking, the corded vacuums were louder than the cordless vacuums (at 96.7 dB, the BISSELL &#8211; 38B1 was unusually quiet for a corded model) so that’s something to keep in mind if you’re considering a corded model.</p>
<h3>Charging and run time</h3>

<p>For the cordless models, charging and run time are important considerations. It can be quite disappointing to charge a stick vacuum for three hours, then find that the battery only lasts for 18 minutes or less as with the Hoover &#8211; LiNX. If you have a small space, this may not matter as much, but it is significant if you’re trying to clean a whole house. While the ratio of charge time to run time isn’t balanced on any cordless stick vacuum on the market today, a shorter charging time and longer run time is preferable.</p>
<p>Most of the manufacturers are clear about their charge time and run time, and we verified this data by timing how long it took each cordless stick vacuum to charge (from 0% battery power) and how long we could run the battery before it fully discharged.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Shark &#8211; Rocket HV382</h2>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Shark-clip.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K7L8U62/?tag=ybdstick-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Rocket HV382</a> has the strongest suction capability of the stick vacuums we tested, and thanks to its unique dual-brushroll system, could handle piles of sand and Cheerios without snow-plowing them to the walls. The brushroll system is designed to capture three types of particles from floors and carpet, so even stuck-on messes (think squashed raisins) come up easily. This meant that it took less work to clean up the floor than with our other stick vacuums.</p>
<p>It easily converts into a handheld vacuum for versatility, has powerful LED lights and comes with a pet multi-tool attachment for embedded pet hair. At nearly 10 pounds, the Shark isn’t the lightest stick vacuum on the market. In fact, it weighs the most out of all the stick vacuums we tested. While it may be top heavy, the unit moves forward with very little force.</p>
<p>The self-propelling motion combined with swivel steering makes the Shark easy to maneuver and navigate around furniture. Once converted into a hand vacuum, it only weighs 4.6 pounds, so it’s easy on the wrists when it comes to above ground level cleaning.</p>

The pet multi-tool attachment makes it easy to clean hair from upholstery or a pet bed.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K7L8U62/?tag=ybdst" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Shark’s patented DuoClean technology changes the game with two brushrolls that work in unison: a soft roll to buff hard floors for a polished look and a bristle brush roll to pull up debris that has worked itself into the carpet. LED headlights illuminate dark corners and under furniture, while the exposed brush roll allowed us to pick up large particles and piles of small particles. This meant that we could vacuum over cereal and rice without it scattering, and that it could handle a small pile of sand in one pass.</p>
<p>The Shark had the most powerful suction of the finalists, but perhaps even more importantly, everything it captured made its way to the filter and dustbin. It aced the emissions test, as the air had fewer small particles after vacuuming than when we started.</p>
<p><strong>The Shark was clearly the winner when it comes to handling pet hair.</strong> Even before we tried the pet multi-tool, we were able to pick up large amounts of pet hair easily with the DuoClean vacuum head. In our pet hair test, the suction was strong enough to suck up litter and embedded cat hair, visibly making a difference in the area where we vacuumed with the Shark. When we measured the output, it weighed 14 grams — more than the other finalists. We also tried it on the areas where other vacuums picked up only two or three grams of hair, and again filled the waste container.</p>
<p>It collected quite a bit of hair in the bristle brush and soft roll, but it was easily removed since you can open the brush roll garage to maintain the brushes. The pet multi-tool works as a hand vacuum attachment, so you can remove embedded pet hair from furniture or inside a kennel. The brush part of this attachment releases to serve as an upholstery tool as well, and the Shark comes with a duster crevice tool, on-board tool clip so you can store your attachments with the wand, and a wall mount.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The self-propelling force and swivel steering of the Shark &#8211; Rocket HV382 make it easy to maneuver around your living room, no matter how many pieces of furniture you own.</li>
<li>It captured the most embedded cat hair and litter with powerful suction, and also comes with a pet multi-tool for more difficult to reach spots such as inside a kennel.</li>
<li>With DuoClean technology, the Shark uses two brushrolls to engage floors and remove stuck-on particles.</li>
<li>There is no front wall, so rather than pushing large particles or piles of sand out of the way, it captures them with the exposed front brush roll.</li>

<h2 id="best-cordless">Best cordless: Dyson &#8211; V8 Absolute</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dyson-v8-clip1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IENFJ14/?tag=ybdstick-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; V8 Absolute</a> is the top of the line and we found the features to be worth every penny. The powerful suction was very close to the power you can get with a traditional upright. It performed better than nearly all our other finalists, and it was a tough call between the performance of the Shark and the Dyson as to which was most effective.</p>
<p>The Dyson is the easiest to convert into a handheld. We especially loved how convenient it was to clean ceilings, drapes and blinds just by adding the combination tool or soft dusting brush to the end of the stick attachment. This high end cordless stick vacuum would be most beneficial to people who want to use one tool for the majority of their cleaning tasks, from vacuuming the multiple floor types to dusting bookshelves to cleaning out car seats.</p>
<p>Powered by a &#8220;digital V8 motor&#8221; which spins at 110,000rpm, the Dyson offers 40 minutes of powerful suction. You can toggle between two power modes: Powerful mode and MAX mode (which gives you just seven minutes of increased power). It has sealed-system HEPA filtration (which we’ll get into in a minute), and quickly transforms into a handheld with several attachments.</p>
<p>Dyson’s statement that the Dyson &#8211; V8 Absolute “expels air cleaner than the air you breathe” sounds like marketing fluff. So we were impressed that the Dyson lives up to its claim, as proved by our emissions test. Not only was there zero dust kickback, the air we measured was cleaner after vacuuming.</p>

<p>While the Dyson is the most expensive stick vacuum currently on the market, those who suffer from allergies might especially find it worth the splurge. The most important aspect to look for when choosing a vacuum to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070522155643.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce dust mite allergens</a> is high efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) filtration. Cordless vacuums don’t usually come with a HEPA filter, making the Dyson V8 unique.</p>
<p>Not only does it have a HEPA filter, the air path from the cleaner head, wand and bin is sealed until the air is expressed through the HEPA filter. <strong>In fact, the Dyson is the only stick vacuum we tested that is certified asthma and allergy friendly by the <a href="http://www.aafa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Even if you don’t suffer from allergies, most of us would agree on the importance of clean air. Dust mites, pollen and pet dander are particles bigger than 0.3 micrometers, so any good vacuum will capture these particles. HEPA filtration is designed to capture particles smaller than 0.3 micrometers, and filter out 99.7% of bacteria, pathogens and microbial spores. Small particles are the most likely to <a href="https://millionhearts.hhs.gov/tools-protocols/tools/particle-pollution.html#app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause health problems</a>, since they can be inhaled deeply into the lungs. If you’re concerned about your indoor air quality, the Dyson is worth the price tag.</p>
<p>In addition to whole machine HEPA filtration, the Dyson comes with two heads so you can adapt the unit to your flooring type: a soft roller cleaner head for hard floors, and a direct-drive cleaner head that removes ground-in dirt for a visibly cleaner carpet. It also converts into a handheld, and can be used with interchangeable attachments: a quick release soft dusting brush (useful for electronics), a mini motorized tool and a quick release combination tool.</p>

<p>At less than six pounds, it’s easy to lift this vacuum to reach high places such as walls and drapes. It has a low profile, so you can easily get under furniture. With all the attachments, you can can easily clean your whole house from floor to ceiling. It only takes four hours to fully recharge and has a run time of 40 minutes. This gives you 10 minutes more run time than any of the other models we tested, for the same charge time or less.</p>
<p>If you use the mini motorized tool to tackle pet hair in small spaces, it gives you 25 minutes of cleaning power. On max mode, you have seven minutes. For most cleaning jobs, you’ll toggle back and forth between power modes and still have enough time to finish the task.</p>
<p>If anything, the Dyson is almost too effective. It pulls up so much dirt that the dust bin fills in a matter of minutes. It’s easy to empty, though, and you don’t have to touch any of the dirt you just vacuumed; all you have to do is pull a lever to release everything into the garbage. The mantra of the stick vacuum game is convenience, convenience, convenience. Emptying the dustbin without removing a filter or getting your hands dirty makes your life easier and less messy.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Dyson &#8211; V8 Absolute is the most effective at capturing microscopic particles and removing dust mite allergens, thanks to a powerful motor and whole-system HEPA filtration.</li>
<li>It has the longest run time of all the stick vacuums we tested, so you won’t get interrupted and have to recharge in the middle of a cleaning session. If you do need to recharge, the Dyson is ready again in four hours.</li>
<li>You can tailor the cleaner head to the type of flooring you have: a soft head made of nylon and anti-static carbon fiber is gentle on hard floors, while the direct-drive cleaner gets deeper into carpets.</li>
<li>It also converts into a handheld in just one click, and comes with multiple attachments for cleaning pet hair, auto interiors and getting into tight corners.</li>

<p>Not everyone wants to spend a significant amount of money on a supplemental cleaning tool. For those, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KCO96C/?tag=ybdstick-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; SimpliStik</a> is a budget-priced corded model that gets the job done without leaving much dust in its wake. Thanks to a long reaching cord, lightweight design and smooth-rolling wheels, you can clean up quickly without any hassle. It doesn’t have a brushroll to engage carpets, LED lighting, or swivel steering like our other finalists, but it is excellent at picking up litter and debris.</p>

It takes up very little space, weighs less than four pounds and converts into a handheld vacuum.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KCO96C/?tag=ybdstick-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>It moves easily from room to room and you only need to search for one outlet in each room, because 16 feet is typically more than enough cord length.</p>
<p>If you need to quickly switch to a handheld with a crevice tool, the Dirt Devil does so easily. Since the crevice tool is an on-board attachment, you don’t have to worry about misplacing it in between tasks. <strong>We found the Dirt Devil to be a multi-functional, handy cleaning tool that manages most jobs, despite a lack of bells and whistles.</strong></p>
<p>Because it converts into a handheld and the power button needs to be accessible in both modes, you are required to bend down to turn the vacuum on/off. Other than this design flaw and a high-decibel noise level, the Dirt Devil is a functional stick vacuum available for a fraction of the cost of the higher end models.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Dirt Devil &#8211; SimpliStik has a lightweight construction and smooth rolling wheels.</li>
<li>It can easily fit into a broom closet, so it’s ideal for small spaces.</li>
<li>As a corded model, it offers constant suction power and comes with a 16 foot cord that easily wraps up for storage.</li>
<li>The on board crevice tool for the hand vacuum makes it easy to multitask; you can clean under the couch and between the couch cushions without switching vacuums.</li>

<p>Unlike the majority of cordless models we tested, which ran out of battery power with little to no warning, the Hoover &#8211; LiNX’s 18V Li-ion battery has an LED fuel gauge so you always know your battery capacity. When all three LEDs are lit, you are operating on at least 75% battery power. When two LEDs are lit, you have at least 50% capacity remaining, and one lit LED indicates 25% capacity. Less than 25% capacity is indicated by one blinking LED light.</p>

<p>As we tested the Hoover, we noticed that the shape of the head and the edge-cleaning bristles made it exceptional at pulling in debris from along walls. We found that we didn’t really need to stop and use an additional handheld along walls and in corners. This feature is so useful (since you don’t have to stop and use a crevice tool or other attachment to pick up debris along the walls) that we would consider the Hoover a runner up to our top pick. It doesn’t make number one, though, because it doesn’t convert into a handheld.</p>
<p>The multi-floor brush roll meant we could vacuum the carpeted living room and then easily transition to the hard floors in the kitchen. It runs for 18 minutes on the highest mode of suction, but it only takes three hours to fully recharge. You can also purchase this model with a spare battery.</p>
<p>It’s better at picking up everyday debris such as cereal, rice and sand than it is at removing pet hair, but overall we were impressed with the Hoover.</p>

<p>As a hand vacuum, the rubber pet attachment helped the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JILGZOC/?tag=ybdstick-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; BDH2020FLFH</a> win top marks as the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/#runner-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best hand vacuum for pet owners</a>. The Black+Decker is an excellent choice if you’re primarily looking for a hand vacuum, with a secondary ability to be used as a stick vacuum. While it was a top performer as a handheld vacuum, the stick attachment was less adept at picking up ground-in dirt than our best stick vacuum finalists.</p>

<p>The stick head is just one of the many attachments that come with this model, so it makes a handy one-size-fits-all supplementary cleaning tool. Since the stick head attachment connects to the flexible hose, you hold the unit in one hand and vacuum with another. It’s only 3.2 pounds, so it isn’t heavy, but it does require the use of both hands. This style is perfect for cleaning walls and ceilings, but it&#8217;s cumbersome if you’re only using it to clean the floor.</p>
<p>As busy individuals, it’s not uncommon to try to finish all your cleaning tasks in one session: picking up pet hair from the upholstery, getting into the crevices between the couch cushions and vacuuming the floor. <strong>If you find yourself switching out cleaning tasks between a handheld and standing vacuum, the Black+Decker is the way to go.</strong> If you’re looking for something to keep the living room floor clean on a daily basis (say, before you let the baby roam), then you may want to go with a more traditional stick model.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LCY0KIO/?tag=ybdstick-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BISSELL &#8211; AirRam</a> is another stick vacuum with a fuel gauge: this one features four quadrants, so you’re well aware of how much battery power remains. It has a 22V lithium-ion battery that lasts for 30 minutes. It takes five hours to fully recharge, but thanks to the battery gauge, you can charge it for just long enough to finish a quick job.</p>
<p>A bulky head made this cordless stick vacuum least helpful at what stick vacuums should do best, cleaning under furniture and reach into smaller spaces. Our annoyance at the bulky head was tempered when we realized how much pet hair it could pick up and how convenient it is to empty the dirt bin. However, because of its bulk and lack of swivel steering, we didn’t include it in the running as a top pick.</p>
<p>The dirt bin pops out of the vacuum, and then you push the hair and debris out using the easy empty slider. You don’t have to tug on the hair or touch any debris with your hands. The hair that caught in the beater bar necessitated the use of scissors, but it was a minimal amount of hair compared to some of the other models.</p>

<p>The swivel steering on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WQHJV8C?tag=ybdstick-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Electrolux &#8211; Ergorapido</a> is phenomenal; swivel action is a great feature in and of itself, but the Electrolux truly glides on carpet and hard floors (We may or may not have danced across the living room with the Electrolux like Fred Astaire with Ginger Rogers. Sorry, Dirt Devil.)</p>
<p>We also appreciated that it has a 30 minute run time, so you can finish a four room house without needing to recharge. Once the battery does discharge completely, it only takes four hours to fully recharge. Most of the vacuums we tested snap together; the Electrolux setup requires a Phillips head screwdriver to fasten handle to vacuum.</p>
<p>One of the neat things about the Electrolux is the motorized brush roll that spins backward at the push of a button to remove tangled hair. This patented self-cleaning feature came in handy when we were picking up large quantities of pet hair, although the suction didn’t fare as well in this test. The Electrolux wasn’t able to pick up cat litter that had settled in the carpet grooves. Another drawback is that you need to remove the filter to empty the dust bin, which can prove to be messy.</p>
<p>The 180° EasySteer maneuverability, self-cleaning brushroll and convenient run time to charge time ratio makes this stick vacuum a good pick for households who prioritize ease of use over power. The lack of power and high emissions kept it out of the running for best pick, although it is still a good stick vacuum.</p>
<h3>BISSELL &#8211; 38B1</h3>

<p>For a stick vacuum on the lower end of the price spectrum, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CFN1BDO/?tag=ybdstick-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BISSELL &#8211; 38B1</a> has a powerful suction that can easily handle sand, cat litter and a moderate amount of pet hair (we’ll call it a vacuum for a one-cat household). We seriously considered it for our budget pick, but the dust kickback was the highest of the vacuums we tested.</p>
<p>However, if you want a lightweight, lower priced model with a two amp motor and versatility, the Bissell is a good choice for you. It weighs only four pounds and has a 16 foot power cord for a long reach. We also appreciated its 3-in-1 convertible capability, which allows you to complete a range of cleaning tasks in one session. It functions as a stick vacuum and a handheld, and the quick release handle makes it easy to remove the handle but keep the foot for stairs. Due to its narrow width, the Bissell is easy to store away in a cupboard or under a bed.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Whether a corded or cordless model best matches your lifestyle, you can’t go wrong with our top picks. Any neatnik would agree that emissions are an important consideration with a vacuum (stick or otherwise), as you don’t want to pull dirt up from the floor just to spray it into the air. Nobody wants to have to dust the bookshelves just because they vacuumed underneath the couch.</p>
