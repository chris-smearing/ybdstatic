<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Our tester, like many who witnessed the heady days of unreliable technological advancement in the 1980s, is skeptical of electronic stud finders. Early stud finders he used were frustrating, to say the least.</p>
<p>We assessed how far the world of electronic stud finding has come by talking to contractors as well as checking internet discussion on the subject. While most grizzled veterans of kitchen cabinet installation projects will tell you a dozen tricks they think are more accurate than electronic stud finders, there are a few sheepish pros and DIY types who will admit to finding better stud finders and being happy with the accuracy.</p>
<p>After checking both reviews from Wirecutter, This Old House and Popular Mechanics, we looked for YouTube reviews of our top picks and confirmed we had found the latest models with the top features.</p>
<p>After checking retailer review scores, we bought the top six electronic scanners that either met a budget of $30 or $70, with higher expectations like electrical and metal scanning from the more expensive group.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve used rare-earth magnets to find studs around the office before, but we bought the highest-rated magnetic stud finders in order to see if the extra features they include really make them better stud finders. An entire package of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Magcraft-Rare-Earth-1-4-in-x-1-in-Rod-Magnet-6-Pack-NSN0719/204721325" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">big neodymium magnets</a> can often be had for the same price or less.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Electronic vs magnetic stud finders: </b>Magnets don&#8217;t stick to wooden studs, but they do stick to the screws that hold your wall up. An electronic stud finder will check for the density change from the actual stud anywhere along its height, while you may have to sweep a magnet back and forth over a large part of the wall before you find one of the screws.</p>
<p><b>Metal scan mode:</b> This mode will look for metallic objects in your wall, rather than wood. In most cases this will be a good way to double-check that you&#8217;ve found a stud by looking for drywall screws, but on an advanced stud finder like the Bosch &#8211; GMS120 you also get a determination if the metal is non-ferrous (like a copper pipe) rather than steel.</p>
<p><b>Deep scan mode:</b> When your wall is covered with lath and plaster or stucco this mode will help you find studs more accurately than a regular stud finder could.</p>
<p><b>Live circuit detection: </b>An electricity detection mode will tell you if you&#8217;ve got energized, un-armored electrical wires in a spot you intend to put a screw or nail.</p>
<p><b>Battery type:</b> most stud finders use a 9V battery type, but one brand we tested uses AA or AAA batteries, which are less expensive and more likely to be in your cupboard already. Rechargeable A-type batteries are also much more common and last longer than rechargeable 9V types.</p>
<p><b>Calibration mode:</b> Basic stud finders require you to start your search over a known-empty section of wall if you want to get accurate detection of studs, while more expensive devices automatically calibrate as you use them.</p>
<p><b>Stud marking features:</b> Holding the stud finder in your dominant hand can make it tricky to mark the center of a detected stud with a pencil. Zircon&#8217;s popular models include a pencil marker in the stud finder itself to make marking easier, while others design the body of the stud finder to facilitate precise marking when you find a center.</p>
<h2 id="how-to">How to use a stud finder</h2>
<p>There are a few key steps you need to understand before you&#8217;ll have success with most stud finders. Here are some details about stud finders you should know before you try to use one to mount a TV bracket or shelf.</p>
<h3>Calibration</h3>
<p>Most stud finders start with a calibration step: The sensor checks how dense your drywall is so that the device doesn&#8217;t give you false positives. Most devices do this calibration step on power-up when you hold down a button, so you need to hold the stud finder against your wall in a place where you&#8217;re pretty sure there is no stud. (About a foot away from a corner is usually a good place to try.)</p>
<p>If you get strange readings, like detected studs that are too close together or no studs at all, try calibrating in a different starting spot to see if you accidentally calibrated on top of an object inside the wall.</p>
<p>Better stud finders like the Zircon &#8211; MultiScanner and Bosch &#8211; GMS120 will automatically re-calibrate as you move around the wall, which makes them less likely to give false readings. Franklin Sensors scanners like the ProSensor T6 use a different method: These models have an array of sensors constantly checking against each other, which makes calibration unnecessary. None of the stud finders are fool-proof, though.</p>
<h3>Knowing what to expect</h3>
<p>Drywall installations use 48-inch-wide pieces, so a wall will almost always have studs evenly spaced inside that length. Sometimes you can even see the intersecting angles of different sheets or finishing lines if you look carefully at a large section of wall or shine a flashlight along it.</p>
<p>Studs are typically 16 inches apart, sometimes 24 inches apart and only rarely at any other spacing. You should look first at 16-inch intervals from the corner of the room; you can also check baseboards for nail marks that should indicate where the studs are.</p>
<p>Features like electrical outlets or light switches also show you stud locations, since they&#8217;re almost always nailed to a stud before wall surfaces go up.</p>
<p>In most rooms you should be able to use those facts and listen to the sound of a tap on the wall to figure out where most of your studs are, even without a stud finder. A stud finder can help confirm your guess before you make a hole, though.</p>
<h3>Sweeping the wall</h3>
<p>Standard practice is to start by calibrating your stud finder somewhere you don&#8217;t expect a stud and then move in a horizontal line across the place you need to find one.</p>
<p>As the stud finder approaches the edge of a stud, you&#8217;ll see an indicator that it detects a change in density. Mark this point with a pencil on a piece of masking tape or a post-it note.</p>
<p>As the stud finder crosses the stud, most will show you an indicator when you&#8217;re over the center. You should mark this point the same way you did the edge.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re past the stud on the other side, come back around slightly higher or lower than your first line, and mark the other edge and get another reading of the center.</p>
<h3>Connect the dots</h3>
<p>After three passes you should be able to determine a precise stud center line by drawing a vertical line through your marks with a level for reference, but you can probably get it on the first try if you&#8217;re seeing clear readings. When you&#8217;re happy with the consistency of the marks you&#8217;ve made, you can measure and mark the exact height of the fastener you need to install.</p>
<p>After you finish finding all the anchor points you need for a project (or after you pick up <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-drywall-anchors">some drywall anchors</a> for holes you need where studs don&#8217;t line up) then you&#8217;re ready to make the final marks with a level and get out the screw gun or drill.</p>
<h3>Instant scans</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got an instant stud finder like the Franklin Sensors T6, you can skip all of the sweeping and just move the stud finder around until you see a clear three-light indicator that indicates the position and rough size of a stud.</p>
<h3>How to find a stud in a plaster wall</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25337" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Plaster-wall-2.jpg" alt="Test on a plaster wall" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>Lath-and-plaster wall surfaces are trickier than drywall. The surface itself is thicker and denser, so the sound of a hollow opening behind the wall isn&#8217;t as distinct when you tap on the wall. Plaster is also much less consistent than the perfectly-flat gyprock boards in newer construction.</p>
<p>Because the plaster and wood covering are denser and less even compared to drywall, you&#8217;ll need to use a stud finder with a deep scan mode that adjusts the output or sensitivity.</p>
<h3>The magnet trick</h3>
<p>Fortunately, even plaster wall surfaces still use metal fasteners holding them to the studs, so you can usually find studs with a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Magcraft-Rare-Earth-1-4-in-x-1-in-Rod-Magnet-6-Pack-NSN0719/204721325" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">strong neodymium magnet</a> or a purpose-built magnetic stud finder like the Studbuddy.</p>
<p>Sweep in a zig-zag pattern up and down the wall until you find a single metal detection point, then look for other spaced-out points along a vertical line to confirm that it&#8217;s a stud with fasteners. From there you should be able to more quickly find the next stud locations by measuring 16 inches away.</p>
<h3>How to find a stud in the ceiling</h3>
<p>A ceiling is usually just drywall with a texture applied, and stud spacings are usually the same. There are a few tricky aspects to finding ceiling studs, though.</p>
<p>First is the fact that you&#8217;re working directly over your head. This can lead many people to lose their balance or even to feel vertigo. It&#8217;s important that you have a safe, steady platform or step ladder to stand on when you&#8217;re working on a ceiling.</p>
<p>Wearing eye protection is even more important than usual, since you&#8217;ll probably knock dust or ceiling texture into your face.</p>
<p>Another obstacle is that ceiling texture itself, lumpy &#8220;popcorn&#8221; texture especially. This stuff will make it very difficult to slide a stud finder back and forth across the surface of the ceiling. Using a piece of paper or thin cardboard can help, but unless you tape or tack the paper to the ceiling it can make the over-your-head one-hand sweeping motions into an ordeal.</p>
<p>A good deep scan mode helps make up for the extra gap created by the texture, but in our tests it was better calibration accuracy that made the biggest difference in eliminating false positives on a popcorn ceiling.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We used each of these devices to check for studs in four different areas with multiple passes. Most of those tests were behind half-inch drywall, including two checks in a wall we knew had a copper drain pipe and electrical wire inside. One test was on an exterior stucco wall with steel lath, and one more was on a ceiling with popcorn-type texture. We also did some follow-up checks on plaster walls after our depth and stucco tests returned surprising results.</p>
[table id=318 /]
<h3>Ease of use and speed</h3>
<p>We tested all of the stud finders to see how easy they were for untrained users to pick up and use. Factors like complicated calibration or scan-mode selection options resulted in docked points, while scanners that built confidence with quick, clear readings were given bonus points.</p>
[table id=317 /]
<h3>Depth test</h3>
<p>We also did a check for depth calibration using a piece of half-inch foam over the drywall to see what happens when walls are thicker than normal.</p>
<p>The air gap and stucco or plaster walls are the only tests we tried that foil the Franklin Sensors stud finders, while the other devices with deep scan modes passed these tests almost as easily as they did on a regular wall.</p>
<h3>Electrical wire detection test</h3>
<p>We tested the ability of these stud finders to see live circuits around live receptacles and switch boxes, and with an extension cord behind a mock-up testing wall.</p>
<p>All of the stud finders with live wire detection features were able to see an energized extension cord behind a piece of drywall. But in the walls in our tester&#8217;s home and office, live circuits didn&#8217;t trigger the device. That&#8217;s almost certainly because those wires are run through an armored jacket, which grounds out any electromagnetic field the device would be able to sense. Even a household circuit-breaker panel wasn&#8217;t enough for the stud finders to see through normal shielding.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a huge problem for most of us; building codes keep electrical wires away from the edge of a stud, and it&#8217;s pretty easy to tell if you do happen to screw something into an armored cable that the stud finder misses.</p>
<p>The live circuit detection feature is nice to have for the rare situations where it could save you from accidentally hammering or screwing into un-armored wire between studs in houses where you&#8217;ve only got bare Romex wire in the walls, but it&#8217;s not an essential feature.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re using one of these sensors, you should always turn off circuits running through a wall you&#8217;re drilling into.</p>
<h2 id="best-drywall">Best on Drywall: Franklin Sensors &#8211; Prosensor T6</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25334" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/FranklinT6-solo.jpg" alt="Franklin Sensors - T6" width="2000" height="1333" /><br />
If you want an accurate picture of where studs are behind your drywall, but you don&#8217;t want to practice a methodical back-and-forth sweep to get it, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071LF2BRY/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Franklin Sensors &#8211; Prosensor T6</a> is an inexpensive option that works flawlessly in drywall.</p>
<p>This is a different kind of electronic stud finder. Instead of using one or two sensors and telling you when the reading changes as you sweep the tool across the wall, Franklin designs their tools with more sensors that read a larger area simultaneously. The T6 covers a three-inch-wide section, compared to the seven-inch width of the more expensive T13.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The Prosensor T6 is a textbook definition of a measuring tool that&#8217;s very accurate but not at all precise. You don&#8217;t actually get a true center-line indicator, just three lines (with an inch in between) that wiggle back and forth a bit as you slide across a stud location. Even with wider or narrower objects we tested, the T6 is programmed to give you a vague one-inch &#8220;right here&#8221; indication rather than ever trying to show a precise outline.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/T6-marking.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Since finding the precise center of a stud isn&#8217;t usually important, this process gives you exactly what you need, and quickly: If you get three lights, the center light is within a half-inch of a stud center, and you&#8217;ve got at least a half-inch of room beside it before the edge of the stud. If you slide the T6 one way or the other, the indicators will shift over to follow the stud, so if you mark the two &#8220;middle&#8221; lines you see you&#8217;ll have a very accurate target about a third of an inch wide.</p>
<p>Both the Franklin Sensors T6 and T13 show plenty of false-positive lights as you sweep over the wall, just like other stud finders; the difference with these &#8220;instant read&#8221; models is that when it can get a clear reading on a stud, you know for sure because of the telltale three lights that track as you move it slightly from side to side. On other models, you&#8217;d have to track a new sweep over the area to double-check a false reading.</p>

<h3>Not as good in plaster</h3>
<p>Our only real reservation with this recommendation is that the Franklin Sensors design isn&#8217;t very good at finding studs in thick plaster or metal-backed stucco. They claim that these sensors are deep-scanning, but in lath-and-plaster walls the T6 only sometimes works accurately.</p>
<p>The Franklin Sensors stud finders don&#8217;t have any other features, either. There&#8217;s no metal detector (though they&#8217;ll find metal studs well enough based on density) and no live electrical wire detector.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the T6 uses AAA batteries, which are much less annoying than the 9-volt type other electronic stud finders use.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the T13 if you want a built-in level, pencil holder and 8-inch ruler; the extra width doesn&#8217;t make it more accurate or precise.</p>
<p>For mounting shelves the price and simplicity of this device are unbeatable. Magnets will be almost as reliable, but the T6 is quicker in drywall.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>To find studs accurately and quickly behind drywall, the Franklin Sensors &#8211; T6 is excellent.</li>
<li>While the T6 won&#8217;t give you a precise center line, it always gives a reliable target for your screw or nail.</li>
<li>The AAA batteries are much less expensive than the usual 9V in other tools.</li>
<li>All this in the least-expensive stud finder we tested.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-plaster">Best for plaster: Zircon &#8211; Multiscanner 740</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25330" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Plaster-wall.jpg" alt="Zircon - 740" width="2000" height="1333" /><br />
For those who expect precision and versatility along with accuracy, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AHYDWNK/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zircon &#8211; Multiscanner 740</a> is a great example of all the technological advancements available in a traditional electronic stud finder.</p>
<p>Zircon is the original patent licensee and most prolific maker of electronic stud finders, and the 740 is one of their top models. It still relies on a methodical back-and-forth sweep, though, and so it&#8217;s slower to use than the instant-read Franklin Sensors &#8211; Prosensor T6.</p>
<p>Of the two Zircon models we tested, the more expensive 740 was clearly working harder to earn its keep. The extra scan modes for metal and electrical wiring are notable, but the superior calibration accuracy is what really sets this scanner apart. Whether in drywall, ceilings, plaster or stucco, this deep-scanning sensor got the clearest detections overall.</p>
<p>The Zircon also self-calibrates as it&#8217;s scanning, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about starting in the wrong location and getting false readings.</p>

It’s not as simple to use for quick estimates as the T6, but the Zircon does help you mark a more-precise center line.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AHYDWNK/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean the Zircon is foolproof. We still got false positives with this stud finder, and the red light indicator and precision pencil marking system are not actually telling you where the exact center of a stud is every time. It&#8217;s just better than most comparable tools.</p>
<p>The two-part hinged design is both a blessing and a curse: You don&#8217;t have to hold a button down, it just uses pressure against the wall as a power switch instead. That means it&#8217;s more susceptible to turning on in a tool bag, and it&#8217;s frustrating when you&#8217;re working on uneven wall surfaces or especially when trying to skim along a textured ceiling.</p>
<p>The live wire detection worked well in our fake-wall tests with an extension cord, but the armored cable used inside many home walls isn&#8217;t detected. If you know you have un-shielded Romex in your walls, this feature might be worth buying for.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a device that works well on all wall types and helps you quickly mark center line estimates, this is a worthwhile upgrade.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Zircon &#8211; Multiscanner 740 was the most precise scanner we tested.</li>
<li>Four scan modes let you find more than just wooden studs.</li>
<li>The deep-scan mode is tricky to activate, but works better than anything else in stucco or concrete.</li>
<li>A built-in marking device will save you time on big projects.</li>
<li>Not as quick or easy to use as our top pick.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-magnet">Best magnetic stud finder: Studbuddy Plus</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25339" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Studbuddy.jpg" alt="Studbuddy Plus" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>A magnetic stud finder relies on a tricky cheat to help you find studs: Instead of scanning for the wood inside your wall, it just sticks to the fasteners which hold your wall to the studs. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TK4QCYB/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Studbuddy Plus</a> uses two very strong magnets and an easy-to-grip housing to make sweeping the wall easy.</p>
<p>One great perk of the Studbuddy Plus is that it also has a built-in spirit level. You can switch from finding a stud to marking a level horizontal shelf line without pulling out a second tool, and that saves a lot of time.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TK4QCYB/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-180x180.png 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stubbuddy-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Magnet: Studbuddy Plus</h3><p>The Studbuddy Plus is a good multi-purpose tool, but it's still an affordable option for finding studs in nearly any wall. You could by a pack of neodymium magnets instead, but not for much less money.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TK4QCYB/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Compared to the other magnetic designs we tried, the Studbuddy Plus doesn&#8217;t try to show you the precise centerline of a stud at all. The width of the plastic body is just under an inch and a half, so if you trace a line on either side you&#8217;d have a rough outline of the stud underneath.</p>
<p>Because screw heads are on the edge of drywall sheets rather than centered on the stud, though, your lines will usually be a half-inch offset from the true stud underneath.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s still good enough for most jobs, just don&#8217;t rely on the vertical lines you can draw with this tool to show you the limits of where a screw can go. Magnets don&#8217;t usually stick on the exact center of a screw head anyway, so you should never rely on a magnet for that without marking a bunch of the zig-zagging screws and finding a center line between them.</p>
<p>The Studbuddy Plus is a multi-purpose tool that adds a handy level to all the strengths of other magnetic stud finder designs. This is the first magnetic finder we&#8217;ve seen that actually gives you more functionality than a set of bare magnets would.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Studbuddy Plus in an inexpensive magnetic stud finder that does more than the rest.</li>
<li>This is a bit easier to grip and sweep back and forth than other magnets.</li>
<li>Studbuddy integrates a bubble level into this stud finder, so you can finish your job quicker.</li>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t have a notch or indicator for marking precise center lines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-other-finalists">The other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>Bosch &#8211; GMS120</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25332" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Bosch.jpg" alt="Bosch" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>With an even more advanced set of wall-scanning tools than even the Zircon Multiscanner, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004TACMZ8/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; GMS120</a> does it all. You get the wood, metal and electrical scan modes you&#8217;d expect, but the GMS120 will also detect metal objects like fasteners while you&#8217;re in the other scan modes, and it can even distinguish between steel and copper.</p>
<p>Knowing that you&#8217;ve found a copper pipe instead of a screw head is a pretty great perk, and could save you from costly mistakes. The accuracy wasn&#8217;t that impressive, though, so it&#8217;s not as quick to use overall</p>
<p>We like most Bosch tools, like the impressive GLM 50C that won top place in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-laser-measuring-tool/">laser distance meter review</a>. On this stud finder Bosch has included thoughtful options like a mute button and a big pencil-marking guide, and this is still less expensive than the Zircon, but the accuracy and consistency were just not good enough to beat the other top two stud finders.</p>
<h3>Franklin Sensors &#8211; ProSensor T13</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25335" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Franklin-T13.jpg" alt="Franklin Sensors - T13" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Everything we liked about the Prosensor T6 is also true of the bigger <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DHVJWKP/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Franklin Sensors &#8211; ProSensor T13</a>, but the increased price makes it a hard sell. You&#8217;re paying three times more for a wider sensor, but the T6 is already more than wide enough to work effectively.</p>
<p>You do get a level, ruler marks and a pencil holder in the T13, which might save you time. But is it worth $40 more? For that much you could buy the T6 and a couple of StudBuddy Plus magnets with built-in levels, and you&#8217;d still have change left for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-mechanical-pencil/">a nice mechanical pencil.</a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to spend $60 on a stud finder, you&#8217;ll probably be miffed that it doesn&#8217;t find electrical wires or work better than this in stucco or plaster.</p>
<h3>Zircon &#8211; SS70</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25331" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Zircon-SS70.jpg" alt="Zircon - SS70" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Zircon&#8217;s highly-developed stud finders are good at the side-to-side sweep detection method. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AHYDXGQ/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zircon &#8211; SS70</a> is slightly less accurate than the bigger 740, and it doesn&#8217;t work as well through difficult surfaces like metal-lath-backed stucco.</p>
<p>For $29 this is a good stud finder once you get the hang of the back-and-forth sweeping. It also has a live electrical-circuit detector that could be useful if you&#8217;ve got unshielded wire it will actually find. But the Franklin Sensors T6 costs less, is much quicker to use and is less likely to give a confusing reading.</p>
<p>Vivreal &#8211; VIVSF-01<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25329" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Vivreal.jpg" alt="Vivreal" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>If you want a metal-scanning mode on a stud finder for less than $30, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B9VKWSL/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivreal &#8211; VIVSF-01</a> is not a bad pick. This is decidedly last-generation stud finder technology, though, with a power-on calibration time of 10 seconds. It&#8217;s also the least-accurate stud finder we tested with false positives all over the place.</p>
<p>If you do enough sweeps back and forth you&#8217;ll be able to find the real center of a stud with this model, and it performed better on stucco than our top pick in deep scan mode, but it&#8217;s not a tool we&#8217;d want to use every day. If you can only spend $25, get the Franklin T6 and a big package of magnets instead (or both).</p>
<h3>Other magnetic stud finders we tested</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25333" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CHHanson.jpg" alt="CH Hanson Stud 4 Sure" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>The least-expensive option we tested was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IKK0OI/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CH Hanson &#8211; Stud 4 Sure 03040</a>. Buying this stud finder is probably less expensive than buying a pack of rare-earth magnets to build your own, and it has a good, strong pair of magnets spaced slightly wider than the Studbuddy&#8217;s set.</p>
<p>If you wanted to mark five or six screw locations and average them out to get a best-possible guess at a precise stud center, the Stud 4 Sure has a small indicator that helps you make more consistent marks than the Studbuddy. The level is too small to be useful for anything other than keeping your marks more-or-less in line with the screw heads you find.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25338" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Studball.jpg" alt="Studball" width="2000" height="1333" /><br />
The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JV3JNE6/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rack-A-Tiers &#8211; Studball</a> is a great design solution to the problem of covering larger areas of wall quickly: Rather than embedding a magnet in a block of solid plastic that you slide back and forth, this design uses a tail of stretchy silicone so you can swing the magnet around quickly without missing your marks. The silicone coating also helps keep the magnet from marking up your wall.</p>
<p>This works well to speed up how quickly you can sweep over a wall for screw heads, and we&#8217;d love to have a dozen of these when marking studs for a big project, but it&#8217;s not worth the extra $5 over other magnetic options.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After spending years tapping on walls and using bare magnets, we&#8217;re happy to say that the latest stud finders really are better than they used to be.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071LF2BRY/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Franklin Sensors &#8211; Prosensor T6</a> is claimed to be an instant stud finder, and it really is much quicker to use than the old side-to-side sweep type. It isn&#8217;t as reliable in thick plaster or stucco, but for interior walls it&#8217;s an amazing tool at an affordable price.</p>
<p>If you need better scanning in thick wall surfaces, or extra metal and live electrical circuit detection modes, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AHYDWNK/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zircon &#8211; Multiscanner 740</a> gives the most reliable results we&#8217;ve ever seen in a traditional electronic stud finder.</p>
<p>For many people, using a strong magnet to find screw heads under paint will be enough to get the job done. If you&#8217;re looking for the best way to use this trick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TK4QCYB/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Studbuddy Plus</a> is easy to slide around and has a built-in spirit level for lining up that shelf or bracket once you find the stud.</p>

It's not as good as more expensive deep-scanning stud finders in thicker plaster, but even at this low price it still beats the top contenders in regular half-inch drywall. It's much quicker than hunting for screws with a magnet, too.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071LF2BRY/?tag=ybdstud-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>

<p>Our writer for this review has been using laser distance measures at work for five years, mostly while rigging speaker and projector installations as an audio-video technician at convention centers and other event venues. He&#8217;s also used laser distance meters to generate computer-based layouts for home renovation projects. He uses his laser distance measure on most of his projects for Your Best Digs, everything from measuring edge angles on <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-kitchen-knives/">kitchen knives</a> to measuring how far a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">leaf blower</a> can throw a weighted box.</p>

<p>Victor Millares is a project manager with <a href="https://www.vikingenviro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viking Environmental Group</a> and uses laser measurers every day to estimate asbestos and lead abatement jobs.</p>
<p>Christina Younger is an architect working at <a href="https://www.gensler.com/offices/newport-beach/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gensler in Newport Beach</a>, and she primarily transfers site measurements from Leica measuring tools into building information software like RevIt or into AutoCAD.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcellus-wesley-06987716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcellus Wesley</a> is a director of operations for audio-video service provider PSAV at a conference center in Anaheim, California, with seven years of experience flying projector screens and speaker arrays. Marcellus typically designs his shows in VectorWorks.</p>
<h3>Competitive price range</h3>
<p>After looking at the full range of offerings from the market leaders — Bosch, Leica and Hilti — we narrowed our search down to the meters that will provide extra functionality for common indoor tasks, but stay inside a reasonable budget. Two of our experts have had expensive meters stolen from job sites and said they would make do without rarely used features or the most prestigious brands to avoid repeating that heartache.</p>
<p>We tested four models in the $80–$150 range and three in the under-$50 price range. All had excellent average review scores from buyers, though we did go with a newer DEWALT meter over an older, better-reviewed model that&#8217;s discontinued.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
[table id=314 /]
<p><b>Stake out: </b>When you need to place a feature like a wall stud, light fixture or shelf support at precise, regular intervals, stake-out mode will help you mark those spots at the distances you set. Bosch gives you some wiggle room with an indicator of where your mark is on the inch-and-a-half-tall screen as you slide the tool past, while Leica just tells you how much farther you have to go to land on the next mark with the back of the tool.</p>
<p><b>Painter mode: </b>Most of these tools will let you measure the height and length of a wall and then show you the area, but the better meters also let you add or subtract other areas — add up all the walls, subtract windows and doors — to give you a total wall area for paint coverage estimates.</p>
<p><b>Indirect height measurement: </b>If you remember the Pythagorean theorem, you know that you can check the length of a line by measuring two other lines in a right triangle. Laser measurement tools typically include a mode that calculates the result for you automatically, which can be very handy if you want to know the height of a building feature you can&#8217;t quite reach.</p>

<p><b>Level and tilt sensors:</b> When you&#8217;re measuring walls it helps to know when you&#8217;re actually holding the meter level so you don&#8217;t add extra length by measuring an angle. The Bosch takes this even further, giving you a precise tilt measurement. You&#8217;ve got an excellent tilt sensor on most smartphones these days, but having a laser level, angle finder and tape measure in one tool is very convenient.</p>
<p><b>Unit Reading Options: </b>This is the number of different options you&#8217;re given for seeing the displayed results of a measurement. All the meters offer a foot-inch-fraction mode to replicate what you&#8217;d get from an old-fashioned tape measure, but the better meters offer other modes like inch-and-fraction readings or decimal readings (see below).</p>

<p><b>Decimal readout: </b>This feature is, of course, always available for metric units. But many professionals in North America (even tradespeople in Canada working on residential projects) use inches and feet for measuring rooms and building materials. Just because you measure ceiling height in feet doesn&#8217;t mean you want to be stuck entering fractions in your design software or converting them to add measurements together. Decimal readouts for feet are available on all but two of the meters, and both of our runner-up picks let you see decimal inches.</p>

<h3>Laser advantages</h3>
<p><b>Convenience and range:</b> A laser distance measure is more compact than a tape, and it&#8217;s infinitely faster. But the biggest advantage is when you&#8217;re measuring distances longer than your arm span or across a gap. With a laser, you don&#8217;t even need to be able to touch the point you&#8217;re measuring to, so long as you&#8217;ve got a clear view of it.</p>
<p><b>Easy calculations:</b> The laser is dominant in measuring indoor spaces, making it simple to calculate how much paint you need for a giant wall or how much air volume a heating system needs to move. Estimators nearly all carry one, even if the contractors they work with stick to the old metal tape.</p>
<p><b>Precision: </b>Tape measures aren&#8217;t inaccurate, but the way we use them often involves rounding to a convenient fraction and even adding up multiple rounded measurements. Lasers will always give you a measurement down to the smallest fraction or decimal available, and the accuracy is just as good as a tape.</p>
<h3>Tape advantages</h3>
<p><b>Easier for simple measurements:</b> If you&#8217;re just spacing out picture frames or centering a large bedroom mirror before you drill holes for <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-drywall-anchor">drywall anchors</a>, a tape might be less hassle to work with than a laser. Still, if you have a corner of the room to measure from, a laser with a built-in level and a &#8220;stake-out&#8221; mode for marking evenly spaced distances can do the job very quickly.</p>
<p><b>Surface measurements:</b> A laser lets you down if you want to measure along a surface rather than between objects. Marking a board for miter-saw cuts, for example, is far easier with a tape. Lasers are also pretty bad at measuring uneven terrain like grass. You can use stakes, post-it notes or masking tape to create targets for the laser to shoot, but a tape measure can just hook onto a corner or lie on the ground.</p>
<p><b>Bright sunlight: </b>If you&#8217;re working with a hand-held meter on an outdoor job, you need to keep track of the laser dot by setting up your measurements carefully and resting the meter on stable objects. A tape will nearly always work flawlessly, so long as it&#8217;s long enough for the job.</p>
<h3>Other measurement tools</h3>
<p>Augmented reality programs on your smartphone are now able to create impressive room maps with just motion sensors and cameras, but none of them are precise enough to give you a layout you can rely on for important jobs. With the right combination of software and a Bluetooth-connected laser distance measure to verify critical dimensions, however, you can get the best of both worlds.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We ran each of these tools through day-to-day tasks for contractors, insurance estimators and home improvement hobbyists. Our tester created a room layout for his home office with each device, then put up a picture or shelf, measured distances of cabinets, estimated the length of a network cable run and calculated wall area of a bathroom renovation.</p>
<p>We checked the outdoor usability of each tool side-by-side, checked accuracy in a calibration test and tested the Bluetooth connection of three models on an Android smartphone.</p>
<h3>Basic use tests</h3>
[table id=313 /]
<p><b>Outdoor visibility:</b> None of these meters is ideal for outdoor use at long ranges, since they don&#8217;t have viewfinders to show you exactly what they&#8217;re pointing at when you lose track of the dot. Brighter lasers still make a difference at short ranges or even indoors on sunny days, though. We also highly recommend picking up contrast-enhancing red glasses like this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00093DJ4M/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pair from DEWALT</a> to help you track a red laser dot in sunlight.</p>
<p><b>Screen readability: </b>If you&#8217;re in a tight corner or working outside, you need to be able to see what measurements you&#8217;re getting without moving the meter. We checked readability from every angle and ranked the tools against each other. Screens with a high-contrast display won this competition easily.</p>
<p><b>Minimum distance:</b> We also checked the minimum distance each tool can measure, listed on the chart above in inches. Other than the Bosch &#8211; GLM 20, they were all able to see a wall at less than 2 inches, but the Leica was able to read about 3/16&#8243; closer than the others.</p>

You pay a bit more for the versatility, but there's a reason disto is practically a generic term for these tools.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8HNPSK/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><b>Maximum distance: </b>After trying to set up a few outdoor concerts with a standard laser, it became clear that a viewfinder like you&#8217;ll find on the $300 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BNSYP4M/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; GLM 400</a> is essential if you want an accurate distance for anything other than the side of a building.</p>
<p>Useful hand-held range was about fifty feet before hand movement made measurement impossible, and as you go farther, visibility of the dot in daylight is the biggest limitation.</p>
<h3>Bluetooth compatibility</h3>
[table id=315 /]
<p>To assess how useful Bluetooth features are, we looked first at the manufacturer-provided apps to see if they would meet the needs of a contractor, realtor or estimator taking notes about the size of a room or a specific feature in a room. Next we tried connecting to four popular insurance computer-aided drafting (&#8220;CAD&#8221;) and room planning apps.</p>
<p>The DEWALT &#8211; DW099S is a great example of a Bluetooth tool that meets basic needs but completely fails to live up to its potential. DEWALT&#8217;s own app (actually a sub-page of a tool management app) only allows you to fire the laser remotely or make measurement markings on a photo. We searched for third-party app support and found nothing else that worked with this meter, even among apps that supported older DEWALT models.</p>
<p>Bosch and Leica both give you a layout drawing app to work with. Leica&#8217;s DISTO Plan is good for quickly sketching a basic room and reviewing it, while Bosch&#8217;s MeasureOn is comparable in sketch mode but also offers a detailed plan mode with options for wall thickness, electrical outlet locations and drop ceilings. Bosch even gives you a complete estimate of materials and wall surface for your projects within the MeasureOn app.</p>
<p>A PDF summary export from these apps is going to be good enough for most of us as a reference or for manual transferring dimensions to other software, but Bosch offers file export for the ProCore system and Leica offers a paid unlock for saving .DXF and .DWG files.</p>
<p>Leica was the clear winner on compatibility: Software developers go out of their way to make their apps work specifically with Leica&#8217;s DISTO brand. Leica also offers Windows software that will let you capture Bluetooth measurements in nearly any design or drafting application.</p>
<p>Bosch is arguably better-known among contractors than Leica, but support for the GLM 50C was spotty. Leica is the only brand supported by AutoCAD or TOTAL, the apps we heard the most about from professionals. Both of our top picks worked perfectly in Magic Plan and Floor Plan Creator, two top apps.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a top-class distance meter for the jobsite, or even If you&#8217;re just working on home projects, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015FCJTEA/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; GLM 50C</a> takes the prize with excellent features in a compact, affordable package.</p>
<p>Bosch added a lot of great perks to this device that&#8217;s competing with entry-level lasers from the other big names. The color screen is easy to read, and it also allows you to control the device with a graphical menu system — much easier to use than the basic four-line alphanumeric display on all the other meters.</p>
<h3>Unique functions</h3>
<p>A tilt sensor is the real blockbuster value in this package. With an angle readout in the default measuring mode, you don&#8217;t have to second-guess how horizontal the line is that you&#8217;re shooting. You can make sure that vertical measurements are plumb and even use the level mode to get your new TV or projector bracket level to a tenth of a degree. Bosch also gives you a clever indirect-height mode that uses the tilt sensor instead of relying on you making a 90-degree base measurement.</p>

<p>The most unique feature of the Bosch isn&#8217;t even the tilt sensor, it&#8217;s the stake-out mode for construction projects. Instead of marking your 16-inch studs or cabinet widths at the back end of the meter as on other devices, you see a visual depiction of the mark on the LCD screen.</p>
<p>A mark on the screen doesn&#8217;t let you use the back edge of the tool for making your mark, but it&#8217;s much quicker this way. As you slide the meter along the line you&#8217;re marking intervals on, you have a few inches of wiggle room around each point where you can see the mark on the screen, instead of needing to get the tool nudged to exactly the right spot before making your mark. Bosch&#8217;s interface also makes inputting the interval length for this mode much easier than on Leica&#8217;s two-button system.</p>
<p>Bosch&#8217;s painter-friendly wall-area mode saves time by only asking you to set room height once, then it lets you add as many wall lengths as you need to get a total area. Sadly, you can&#8217;t subtract a window or door area in this mode, but it&#8217;s still a great time-saver for quick estimates. There are regular area- and volume-calculator functions as well, and you can add or subtract in those modes.</p>
<p>Bosch also includes a tripod mount, which most of us won&#8217;t need, but it makes the Bosch even more versatile. You could even use this as a laser-layout marking system, if you&#8217;ve got a trustworthy tripod head to swivel the laser in a perfectly flat plane. This isn&#8217;t survey equipment, but it&#8217;s good for quickly setting the height of cabinets or lining up picture frames.</p>

<p>Bosch&#8217;s Bluetooth support is good, but not perfect. If you need to send numbers to AutoCAD, Revit, VectorWorks or TOTAL, get the Leica. The one advantage Bosch offers pro users is export from the MeasureOn app to the ProCore building management suite. MeasureOn is a pretty detailed floor-plan app on its own, but most professionals will probably only use it to store measurements and build a floor plan somewhere else.</p>
<p>We ran into one hitch with Bluetooth: It turns out that the laser doesn&#8217;t send Bluetooth measurement values the same way in the default &#8220;real-time measurement&#8221; mode, and you have to switch to the other aim-and-press &#8220;length&#8221; mode with some apps.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>As a measuring tool you can use every day on the jobsite or for home projects, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015FCJTEA/?tag=ybddisto-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bosch &#8211; GLM 50C</a> is an excellent value.</li>
<li>The graphical display makes extra settings and modes much easier to find and use.</li>
<li>This tilt sensor and tripod mount are usually only found on much more expensive tools.</li>
<li>At $200, this would be a competitive tool, but it&#8217;s often selling for closer to $110.</li>
<li>Bosch&#8217;s smartphone app is good for basic, accurate room drawings.</li>
<li>Bosch&#8217;s Bluetooth compatibility is a bit lacking compared to Leica if you&#8217;re using pro-grade software.</li>

If you weren&#8217;t expecting to see a Bosch take the top spot in this review, you were probably expecting to see a Leica. In a world where the Bosch GLM 50C didn&#8217;t offer the unique features that come along with the graphical display, Leica would have this in the bag with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8HNPSK/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DISTO D2</a>. &#8220;Disto&#8221; is practically a generic term for laser distance measurers — and for good reason.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re setting up a show in a convention center and need more indoor range than the Bosch offers, or if you are using Bluetooth-connected apps that only support Leica&#8217;s tools, then the DISTO D2 is definitely worth the $40 difference. It&#8217;s a less-flexible stand-alone tool, but it integrates into more complex measurement jobs better.</p>
<h3>Entry-level excellence</h3>
<p>The DISTO D2 is a very basic model compared to the rest of Leica&#8217;s offerings. For a tilt sensor and tripod mount like the Bosch has, you need to spend more than $300 for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DRQK533/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DISTO X3</a>, and $400 gets you the X4 with a zoom viewfinder for outdoor measurements, which compares to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BNSYP4M/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch&#8217;s $300 GLM 400</a>.</p>
<p>Leica&#8217;s interface is the real disappointment after using the Bosch meter. The four-line LCD means modes like stake-out are especially clunky, since you need to set the interval distance by scrolling with just the plus and minus keys. You can&#8217;t even change measurement units without relying on the quick-start guide to tell you the key combination you need — plus and minus at the same time in this case.</p>
<p>The flip-out reference leg for lining up perfect outside corner references is the one feature of the Leica that we missed when going back to the Bosch. The lack of a tripod mount and level indicator makes that a wash, depending on your project.</p>
<p>If you are going to be using the Leica at maximum range, don&#8217;t forget to use the timer feature, which helps you keep the beam on distant targets by eliminating vibration from the button press.</p>
<h3>Better Bluetooth compatibility</h3>

<p>Buying the DISTO D2 makes perfect sense if you use a Bluetooth-connected app that expects Leica hardware. Compatibility with AutoCAD and the widely-used appraisal suite TOTAL is essential if you&#8217;re working in those systems every day, and you&#8217;ll probably never use the digital angle finder or stake-out function for those kinds of projects anyhow.</p>

With the very best Bluetooth compatibility, Leica is going to be an essential purchase for some professionals. The D2 doesn't have all of the features of the Bosch, but it's competitive.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8HNPSK/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The DISTO Transfer Windows software allows you to drop measurements from the tool directly into software like RevIt or VectorWorks on a Bluetooth-capable PC. We tested this in SketchUp, and after some careful setup it entered measurements just as if we&#8217;d typed them. If you prefer working in full CAD drawings to smartphone sketches but can&#8217;t afford more expensive survey gear, this is an excellent option.</p>
<p>Skip the free DISTO Sketch app entirely; it&#8217;s very limited. Leica&#8217;s main measuring app, DISTO Plan, works well with the D2 for drawing a room plan including basic door and window features. The fact that you need the more expensive X3 or X4 to use Leica&#8217;s fast-and-easy Smart Room drawing workflow is annoying. DISTO Plan is easy to work with, but not as easy as Magic Plan or Floor Plan Creator, two of the best room-design apps we tried.</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M5CW7CT/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DISTO D1</a> will still give you Leica&#8217;s Bluetooth connectivity for even less than the Bosch, but your interface is down to one button and you lose all the built-in calculation functions.</p>
<p>If you need the extra measuring range or the specific software support, the Leica &#8211; DISTO D2 is an excellent measuring tool that fills some gaps between the Bosch and much more expensive tools.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Leica &#8211; DISTO D2 is a relatively affordable handheld tool from a top survey instrument maker.</li>
<li>Leica gives you more range than most of us could possibly use with a handheld tool.</li>
<li>If you need compatibility with top CAD apps, this is an easy pick.</li>
<li>You may miss the angle finder or tripod mount of the Bosch, and Leica&#8217;s interface is not as easy to use.</li>

If you just need a tool that tells you the length of a wall so you can write it down, it&#8217;s hard to argue against the value of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9TPP4V/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tacklife &#8211; HD60</a>. This is a well-rounded tool that doesn&#8217;t skimp on options, and it&#8217;s the easiest dot to see in full sunlight.</p>
<p>The Tacklife is a clone of other tools, to be sure. But it&#8217;s just as accurate as the other meters — at any distance you&#8217;d be able to hand-hold them, anyhow. The bubble level indicators are useful to keep you from shooting a wildly sloped line, but they&#8217;re not accurate or precise enough to replace even a smartphone-app-based level.</p>

This is actually the brightest laser we tested, the screen is easy to read, and the calibration was practically identical to the more expensive models.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9TPP4V/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Tacklife has a good customer satisfaction record, and we can see why. The interface is similar to most standard laser tape measures, with a bright screen and dedicated buttons for all the important features.</p>
<p>The option to see readings in decimal inches as well as fractions, feet and meters is a nice touch if you&#8217;re going to use the numbers for calculations or numerical input. Other meters in this price bracket only give you decimal readings for metric units.</p>
<p>If sub-inch accuracy of a distance meter is important to you, you should definitely check against a known reference like a tape measure if you buy this device. The calibration on the device we bought, though, was spot-on down to the millimeter. At 10 feet measured between parallel walls indoors, the Tacklife gave an identical reading to the Leica and Bosch, down to a hundredth of an inch.</p>
<p>The features you don&#8217;t get on the TackLife that you can get with more expensive meters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth connectivity</li>
<li>A fold-out leg for steady corner measurements</li>
<li>Stake-out mode for setting measured intervals</li>
<li>A real tilt sensor</li>
<li>Painter mode for adding up wall area</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither the Bosch nor the Leica has every one of those features at the under-$200 price point, but if you need any of them you should look closely at our top picks. To add just the painter mode at a similar price point, check out the Klein Tools  &#8211; 93LDM65.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9TPP4V/?tag=ybddisto-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tacklife &#8211; HD60</a> has most of the features you could ask for at the price of a long analog tape measure.</li>
<li>Indirect, area and volume measurements work the same as on other meters, though you can&#8217;t add or subtract from them.</li>
<li>The laser dot from this meter is the brightest we found, though it&#8217;s still useless at more than 50 feet in sunlight.</li>
<li>Bubble levels aren&#8217;t precise or accurate, but they are useful when taking a quick measurement without a plumb surface for reference.</li>
</ul>

If you&#8217;re looking for a very affordable distance finder with a name you&#8217;ll recognize, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0OJGYT/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klein Tools &#8211; 93LDM65</a> is a good pick with only a few drawbacks.</p>
<p>The screen and interface are excellent, but this meter has the dimmest dot. It&#8217;s fine if you&#8217;re shooting wall measurements, but in sunlight it&#8217;s easy to lose track of, even with contrast-enhancing red glasses.</p>
<p>Most features you&#8217;re looking for, including minimum-and-maximum mode, a painter-friendly area calculator and an extendible reference stick for tricky surfaces like sharp inside corners. You don&#8217;t get the premium options like stake-out mode or an actual right-angle corner brace, but for about $40 this is a good value.</p>
<p>The Klein Tools meter gave the least-reliable outdoor measurements in our tests, but it&#8217;s still within a millimeter of the other tools for indoor readings.</p>
<p>This is a close contender for our budget pick. If you frequently do wall area estimates and you want a tool you can afford to leave in your unlocked toolbox over lunch, this is a good fit.</p>

Fluke is a name that bears no disrespect: Electricians all over the country will sooner fight you than let you say mean things about their yellow-orange multimeters. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008ZCS21E/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fluke &#8211; 414D</a> is well-protected against drops and it&#8217;s good at what it does, but with a whopping $120 price tag this is too spartan to get a recommendation.</p>
<p>The Fluke meter doesn&#8217;t have a backlight for the screen, let alone a corner support leg or tilt sensor.  The basic modes, including addition and subtraction of measured area, are all here, but you can&#8217;t get foot or inch measurements with decimal display.</p>
<p>If Fluke is calibrating these meters to a higher standard than the imitators, it doesn&#8217;t show up in a way that we could find. There&#8217;s a feeling of security that comes with a professional-grade measurement tool made by a company that stakes its reputation on reliability, but that&#8217;s also true for Leica and Bosch. Those brands are giving you much more for your money with their meters, so there&#8217;s not much reason to buy this model unless you&#8217;re a devoted loyalist.</p>
<h3>Bosch &#8211; GLM 20</h3>

If you&#8217;re looking for a literal replacement for a tape measure, with no features other than checking distances, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CG97GR2/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; GLM 20</a> is a reliable choice.</p>
<p>The GLM 20 isn&#8217;t always easier to use, though, than other more fully-featured options. We liked the simplicity of the one-button interface for basic jobs, but as soon as you need to change the measurement units (by holding down that button when powering up) you&#8217;ll wish you had a more sophisticated device.</p>
<p>This is the least-expensive tool in our lineup, but it&#8217;s not actually any easier to use than the TackLife, which only costs about $7 more. Having the ability to take an indirect height measurement or measure from the front edge of the meter is definitely worth it for the projects we worked on in our tests. If you&#8217;re someone like a camera assistant who only needs estimated focus distance measurements, this bare-bones Bosch meter is a good value.</p>
<h3>DEWALT &#8211; DW099S</h3>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076P96DKY/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DEWALT &#8211; DW099S</a> is not a bad tool by any means, but it misses some key features that we were expecting to see in a Bluetooth-connected measuring tool.</p>
<p>The DEWALT is compact and has a good button layout for all the basic features. The high-contrast screen is one of its best features, earning a tie with the Bosch for easiest screen to read in a dark room or in full sunlight.</p>
<p>There are a few features missing on this meter, however. For example, you get the usual painter-friendly area calculation with add and subtract functions, but no indirect height function. If you remember the Pythagorean theorem you can calculate that yourself, but it seems like an obvious mode to include.</p>
<p>The reason the DEWALT ranks so low on our list is that the app compatibility is poor, but you pay full price for Bluetooth. You can only connect this measuring tool to the DEWALT Connect app, which just has a photo markup function.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not going to be able to export anything close to a CAD file from this app, but you can take a photo of a wall (or even a pencil sketch of a rom layout) and overlay a quick free-hand outline of wall segments with your finger. DEWALT Connect will then let you easily add the distance readings one segment at a time as you walk around the room. It&#8217;s not the most powerful layout tool, but if you like to sketch a room on paper anyhow, it&#8217;s actually much more convenient than other workflows.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Laser distance measuring tools have come a long way, and we were impressed with the accuracy of even the most inexpensive tools we tested. For taking room or DIY project measurements, these all worked well. If you&#8217;re working outside on a bigger job, you&#8217;d need to spend big bucks to get something with a sight glass or camera for reliable measurements at more than 100 feet.</p>
<p>With the best features in a stand-alone tool, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015FCJTEA/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; GLM 50C</a> is a replacement for a tape measure, a plumb bob and even a laser level. The graphical interface makes changing modes and settings much easier, and the free Bluetooth-connected app is a good way to draw basic floor plans.</p>
<p>If you want compatibility with AutoDesk or A La Mode software products, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D8HNPSK/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leica &#8211; DISTO D2</a> is the easy choice. Even though this Disto doesn&#8217;t have as many features as the Bosch, the compatibility will be more important for many professional users.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the other end of the spectrum, just looking for an affordable laser you can still rely on, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9TPP4V/?tag=ybddisto-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tacklife &#8211; HD60</a> is accurate, bright and fairly easy to use without skimping on handy features.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested ten of the best drywall anchors and found that the E-Z Ancor - Toggle Anchor is ideal for mounting decor without a stud for support.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e found eight of the strongest and most innovative products that will help you install your decor and even moderately-heavy shelves on standard drywall without a wooden or metal stud for support. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2JVJE2/?tag=ybddrwlanch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">E-Z Ancor &#8211; Toggle Anchor</a> is the best drywall anchor for most jobs, with easy self-drilling installation and enough support for moderately heavy loads. If you need maximum strength, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0050SWSWU/?tag=ybddrwlanch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wing-Its &#8211; Master Anchor</a> will hold fast until you pull your wall apart, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001KVMNPI/?tag=ybddrwlanch-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Monkey Hooks</a> are great for decorating.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>Everyone who owns a screwdriver probably knows that drywall isn&#8217;t strong enough by itself to support cabinets, flat-screen TVs or large mirrors. But many of us need a way to mount in a specific location without the support of a wooden stud, and few of us can add a brace just for decorating.</p>
<p>Every handyman has different preferences for fasteners, and drywall anchors see a lot of debate. We looked for recommendations from handyman blogs, forums, and publications like This Old House to narrow down what we were expecting from anchors we found.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/lHb-Tcvkn7M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProjectFarm&#8217;s channel on YouTube</a> has an admirable dedication to thorough testing of products like these, so we were eager to check well-reviewed products they didn&#8217;t test and to verify their results.</p>
<p>After compiling a list of all the top recommended anchors, we eliminated basic options that weren&#8217;t at least rated to the strength of an easy-to-use self-drilling anchor like the Toggler &#8211; SnapSkru. We also eliminated options like molly bolts that require extra work for little return in actual strength for a drywall installation.</p>
<p>When multiple vendors made the same product, we picked the option with better reviews, a better price or better availability. (In that order of priority.)</p>
<p>We tested a cast-zinc anchor that is supposed to help in situations where you might accidentally hit a stud, but it fared so poorly in testing (it held half the weight of pop-open plastic anchors) we didn&#8217;t include it in the final list.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/drywall-16-9.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><strong>Installation type</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re handy with a screw gun, you probably won&#8217;t blink at pre-drilling holes, but you can save a lot of time with self-drilling anchors. Hammer-in anchors are also an option, though pushing through the drywall backing paper can tear it and make a weak spot. A sharp awl and a drywall saw can be even easier than a drill, so long as you keep your hole centered.</p>
<p><strong>Support type &#8211;</strong> Pop-open anchors are easy to install and hold well compared to drywall alone, but if you want to hold up a shelf you need an anchor that spreads the weight out. The biggest factor in anchor strength for most applications is how well the anchor spreads tensile load (pulling away from the wall) across a wide area of the inside of the drywall sheet. Look for a two-piece design with a brace inside the wall that clamps down when you tighten your screw through the anchor.</p>
<p><strong>Reusable designs &#8211;</strong> Some anchors will pop out of the wall easily when you remove the screw, but others will require prying or even poking around with wire inside the screw hole to straighten the flip-out anchor so you can pull it out. A few designs are basically permanent, so you need to make a larger hole to remove them.</p>
<p><strong>Hole and flange size &#8211;</strong> If you&#8217;ve got the world&#8217;s strongest anchor but it leaves an ugly plastic flange sticking out past the edge of your shelf bracket, it&#8217;s not much help. Some anchors also require making holes in your wall as big as 3/4&#8243;.</p>
<p><strong>Screw size &#8211;</strong> If you&#8217;ve got a particular bracket you need to bolt to the wall, note the size of the holes and compare your options. A small high-strength machine screw can still work with a larger bracket hole if you add a fender washer, but an oversize screw won&#8217;t go through a small hole unless you get out the drill.</p>

With center-braced 48-by-18-inch shelves and pre-welded components for easy assembly, this is a great way to keep your garage organized. If you want more flexibility, the 14-inch-deep <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DZHLXH/?tag=ybdgarsu-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Basics &#8211; Wire Racks</a> are an affordable way to store smaller items.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>Our garage testing team has built and maintained everything from cheap two-by-four shelves in farm sheds to pallet racks at an audio-video rental warehouse. We spent a long time narrowing down the available options. If you&#8217;ve got a particular shelving need, there&#8217;s someone out there who makes a product or has a DIY plan.</p>
<p>But to find out specifically what most garage enthusiasts are installing, we scoured forums like garagejournal.com, grassrootsmotorsports.com and survivalistboards.com for garage storage ideas. We also checked garage and workshop storage system reviews on YouTube and Reddit.</p>
<h3>Only shelves under $200</h3>
<p>After considering industrial pallet racks shelving that&#8217;s designed to hold loaded freight pallets, we decided to eliminate anything that costs above $200 per shelf. The weight capacity of more expensive shelves is better if you want to store a spare engine for your muscle car, but pallet racks are tricky to assemble and not as efficient when you just need a place for your collection of <a href="http://yourbestdigs.com/reviews/best-storage-containers/">heavy-duty storage tubs</a>.</p>
<h3>Only tool-free, free-standing shelves</h3>
<p>If you leave out industrial and DIY options, the obvious choice is tool-free shelving kits. The components are simple, but when you slide them all together the resulting shelf is strong.</p>
<p>If you want to install drawers or cabinet doors on your shelves there are purpose-built systems available, but free-standing shelves are far more versatile and a better buy in most cases. Cabinets are nice if you do painting work or make a lot of dust in your garage, but most of the time the doors are just in the way.</p>
<p>We compared all the tool-free-assembly shelves we could find locally with popular models online, and bought a less-expensive and a more-expensive option in both wire-rack shelving and boltless shelving. Except for one, these designs all turned out to be generic. Edsal makes most of the boltless shelving that&#8217;s sold in hardware stores, and wire rack shelving is even harder to tell apart.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>

<p><b>Shelf material &#8211; </b>If you need water or mildew resistance because you&#8217;re parking wet vehicles right next to your storage, wire shelving is your best bet. In less demanding conditions, chip-board shelves are stiff and fairly attractive and can be painted to protect it.</p>
<p><b>True weight capacity &#8211; </b>A shelf&#8217;s maximum load rating (often in hundreds of pounds) assumes evenly spread weight and is determined by the strength of the frame. If you weigh down the middle of an unsupported chip-board shelf with even half that much weight, it will bow or even break. Of the boltless clip-together shelving units we tested, only the Gladiator comes with a center support bracket, though you can sometimes buy aftermarket supports. Wire rack shelving is more rigid because the shelves have truss-reinforced welded side support.</p>
<p><b>Shelf dimensions &#8211;</b> Check carefully for how much space you have in your garage, and remember that you&#8217;ll need room to stand in front of the shelves. The most common shelf depth is 18 inches, which holds most of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-storage-containers/">the best storage containers</a> in smaller and medium sizes. If you want to load up <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-lawn-mower/">a 21-inch lawn mower</a> for the winter, you&#8217;ll need to pick a deeper 24-inch version of these shelves.</p>
<p><b>Tool-free assembly &#8211;</b> Screwing or bolting together shelves is tedious work. Tool-free shelves, like the models we tested, will save you some time and frustration. The first shelf is always tricky if you&#8217;re assembling by yourself, though.</p>
<p><b>Wheels or anchors &#8211;  </b>Some shelving comes with holes in the bottom of the shelf uprights so you can anchor it to a floor; boltless shelves aren&#8217;t solid enough that you can move them around. Wire racks, on the other hand, are fairly stiff and rigid, so you can order them with casters that let you move your parts shelf around the garage as you work.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After testing the top-selling brands, we've picked the Rubbermaid - Roughneck as the best storage containers for closet and garage.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing seven different types of containers side-by-side and taking a close look at materials, we&#8217;re confident that the classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KBJ46LK/?tag=ybdstorcon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Roughneck</a> bin is still the best storage container. These polyethylene tubs are tough, so they won&#8217;t shatter in cold storage or when dropped like most bins will. If you&#8217;ve got less demanding needs, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MWTJX2S/?tag=ybdstorcon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ziploc &#8211; Weathershield</a> containers let you see what&#8217;s inside, they&#8217;re water-tight and they come in stackable combinations.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>Our test team has been using storage containers to organize nearly every part of their eclectic lives: In homes, on the farm, at warehouses and even for travel. Over the years, our testers have bought numerous brands and styles of storage containers for different applications. Some have served faithfully for decades in storage sheds, while some were only good for a year before cracking.</p>
<p>We carefully examined lids and materials on all the bins we could find at four different retailers, and cross-referenced with online reviews from sites like Wirecutter, Art of Cleanliness, and Reddit.</p>
<h3>The beloved classic</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KBJ46LK/?tag=ybdstorcon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Roughneck</a> containers are made of flexible, tough polyethylene, and most discussion board posts we read agree that they&#8217;re the gold standard for rugged and reliable storage.</p>
<p>The downside we saw immediately to the Roughneck is that many retailers have stopped keeping them on store shelves and require you to buy sets of six or eight tubs to justify the not-exactly-free shipping.</p>
<p>Sadly, most retailers are now mostly stocking alternatives that only look similar to Rubbermaid&#8217;s styling. In a few cases the polypropylene imitators had cracked while they were still on the store shelf.</p>
<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<p>We found one other affordable polyethylene bin, the Sterilite &#8211; Ultra, with better in-store availability and some design trade-offs. We dismissed other imitators that look more similar to Roughneck&#8217;s construction, but with the same availability issues and poor reviews.</p>
<p>We also sought out the most affordable containers we&#8217;d still trust to keep in storage and found a few options that have compelling features to make up for reduced durability compared to tough polyethylene bins.</p>
<p>We looked into sealed roto-molded containers from brands like Pelican and SKB, but the prices aren&#8217;t justifiable unless you&#8217;re transporting delicate devices to the field or on flights every day. Other large freight-quality shipping containers are a neat idea, but also too expensive for garage or closet storage. We did pick up a Rubbermaid &#8211; Brute commercial-grade container, to see just how much tougher it is to justify the big price jump over Roughneck bins.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Materials: Polyethylene vs. polypropylene &#8211;</b> Low-density polyethylene (stamped on the bottom as LDPE, recycling group number four) is more flexible than stiff, cheap polypropylene (recycling group five), so it won&#8217;t crack as easily if you drop a loaded bin on the garage floor. It also won&#8217;t become brittle at freezing temperatures the way polypropylene does.</p>

<p>Each material has some advantages. <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/lab-plasticware-supplies/plastic-material-selection/polypropylene-pp-labware.html#pp-physical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polypropylene</a> can be made see-through, and it&#8217;s much more heat resistant — all the way up to boiling temperatures. <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/lab-plasticware-supplies/plastic-material-selection/low-density-polyethylene-ldpe-labware.html#ldpe-physical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LDPE</a> is always tougher, but it gets very soft at temperatures above 110 degrees fahrenheit and melts in boiling water. Our testers have seen far more polypropylene bins fail in long-term storage, especially in cold climates, but in a baking-hot attic you&#8217;d want to be very careful about how much weight stack on an LDPE bin.</p>
<p><b>Latching lids &#8211;</b> A flip-up latch will hold your bin closed even if you over-stuff it, which is handy for things like bulky sweaters and puffy blankets. If you put too much strain on latches, though, they&#8217;re prone to pop out of the mounting holes. Those holes also mean an entry point for moisture and insects.</p>
<p><b>A waterproof seal &#8211;</b> If you just need a bin to shed rain, almost any will do: with one exception, the lids we tested cover the edge of the bin, which means water will roll off without getting inside. A totally sealed lid (like our top pick) will also keep out humidity, though damp items can mildew quickly if you&#8217;re not careful about what you put in the bin.</p>
<p><b>Stackable designs &#8211;</b> Nearly any bin can stand on top of another, but some designs are able to neatly mix and match small and large bins while creating a topple-resistant tower.</p>
<p><b>Single-size lids &#8211;</b> If you&#8217;re building a collection of storage containers to fully organize your life, it can be handy to have bins with same-size openings. This usually means you can stack and nest different sizes as well as sharing lids between them. Usually there will be at least two sizes in a series of containers with a common lid and footprint size, with the difference in volume made up by height.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After a full year of testing eight wiper brands in the rain and sun, we found out the real differences between wiper brands. The best windshield wiper is the Rain-X Latitude: It wipes well and fits most cars.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter a full year of testing eight top-rated windshield wipers in the rain and sun on a Toyota Corolla, we concluded that most wiper brands give you basically the same performance. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015JTJNQI/?tag=ybdwiper-20">Rain-X &#8211; Latitude</a> wins our pick for best windshield wiper. The Rain-X install bracket provides near-universal compatibility, which makes buying the right blades much easier. If you have a windshield that common wipers won&#8217;t fit well, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JU5VUK/?tag=ybdwiper-20">Bosch &#8211; Icon</a> line features different wiper curvatures that should help prevent fit-related problems.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We spent days combing the web for clear indications of what makes a superior wiper. The few reviews we found presented mostly anecdotal evidence: basically, people put new wiper blades on their cars, and they’re happy, unless the blades don&#8217;t fit.</p>
<p>Bad fit can lead to streaks or even gaps in wiper coverage, so finding wipers that could match the fit of factory-original wipers was at the top of our checklist.</p>
<p>Many enthusiasts comment that their vehicles don&#8217;t work well with universal-fit wipers bought from the auto-parts store or gas station. The more prestigious your car, the more likely enthusiasts are to recommend buying replacements from the dealership.</p>
<p>Consumer Reports used to run tests of different wipers across their extensive fleet of test vehicles, but they gave up trying to find &#8220;better&#8221; wipers and now <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/wiper-blades/buying-guide/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simply recommend frequent replacement</a>.</p>
<p>Wirecutter has picked up where Consumer Reports left off; their comparison review is the only one we found that actually attempts to rank wipers against each other. We checked out all the top picks from the Wirecutter review, as well as some alternates they mentioned but didn&#8217;t test.</p>
<p>Finally, we went to Amazon and other retailers to find the top-rated and most-purchased wiper blades. We specifically looked for high overall scores to test the best blades against each other.</p>
<p>The negative scores on popular wipers (there are always negative reviews) pointed to some consistent problems that cause frustration. Streaks and noise are the most common complaints, which could result from dirt, but they&#8217;re also signs that wipers don&#8217;t fit a windshield well.</p>
<p>We selected a price range from $6 to $25 in order to compare premium and budget picks across a variety of popular types.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-wipers">Types of windshield wipers</h2>
<p>There are only a few categories of windshield wipers, based on the shape of the support bracket that presses the wiper blade evenly against the windshield.</p>
<p><b>Traditional support:</b> This wiper design is still very common and pretty much the same as it&#8217;s been for decades. The support bracket is actually a &#8220;tree,&#8221; with one large support holding two smaller supports that each press on four smaller brackets.</p>
<p>All of these pieces can swivel toward or away from the windshield to adjust to its contours, so the pressure of the wiper arm is evenly distributed around curves. The pressure points themselves do tend to wear faster than the rest of the blade, though.</p>

<p><b>Beam support:</b> This new support design is becoming standard for  luxury-class vehicles and upgrade trim packages., This bracket uses one long band of curved spring steel, rather than a set of swiveling arms, to maintain even pressure.</p>
<p>The beam design looks nice, and its low profile helps prevent snow and ice from building up and freezing your wiper. This type of wiper also minimizes aerodynamic drag at speed.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s almost always a rubber &#8220;spoiler&#8221; fin on the back of beam wipers to keep all that airflow from causing the blades to lift off when you put your foot down.</p>
<p>If your windshield has a tighter or flatter curve than the beam-support bracket is made for, the pressure won&#8217;t be as evenly applied across the wiper edge. Generally, though, wiper blades are flexible enough so this only happens in extreme cases.</p>
<p>Companies like Bosch claim that beam wipers made as original equipment for specific cars fit the contours of a windshield better. If that’s true, then any replacement blades you buy would have to be  comparable.</p>
<p><b>Hybrid support:</b> Most manufacturers also sell wipers that are closer to the look of a beam-type support but keep the traditional equal-pressure arms under a sleek cover. We didn&#8217;t test this type of wiper since it&#8217;s basically just a more attractive version of a traditional bracket.</p>
<p><b>Other designs for snow and ice:</b> Beam-type wiper blades are about as good as it gets for preventing snow and ice problems. If the wiper uses a traditional support system, the manufacturer can cover up the holes and gaps in the frame so that snow and ice can&#8217;t freeze the moving pieces together.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We used each of the eight wipers on a Toyota Corolla for approximately four weeks of testing in real-world conditions in southern California. After that break-in period, we tested each wiper to see if it still held up well and wiped away water cleanly.</p>
<p>Wear and tear on a wiper&#8217;s thin rubber blade is caused by several factors; baking in the sun&#8217;s ultraviolet-spectrum rays is the most damaging, followed by  oxidation from the air. We left all eight sets of wipers out in the sun for an additional 20 weeks to see what would happen to the rubber.</p>
<h3>Fit and compatibility</h3>

[table id=248 /]
<p>We tested on a car with a J-hook connector, which is fairly common, but even if you have a wiper arm that everyone makes adapters for it&#8217;s best to check with a parts catalog for the correct length before you buy your wipers. We also checked each brand specifically for wipers compatible with the VW Beetle, Land Rover, and Honda Civic.</p>
<p>Rain-X won points here for selling a wiper with a near-universal adapter. For most cars on the road, you&#8217;ll only have to look up the lengths you need when buying.</p>
<p>Most parts catalogs are fairly easy to use, but bigger manufacturers like Bosch have four or five different styles of wipers that will fit your car. They don&#8217;t tell straight up &#8220;this is for cheapskates&#8221; or &#8220;these should be as good as you can get,&#8221; you&#8217;re mostly left to infer that after looking at prices on a retailer listing.</p>
<p>Of note is the Aero website: Aero has a vehicle-compatibility widget, but it has been broken every time we checked. The AERO wipers for J-hook cars are easy to find, but if you have some other type of attachment system you&#8217;re in for some detective work if you want to buy these wipers. They have installation instructions for a &#8220;Multifunction&#8221; wiper, but if you want to buy it you&#8217;ll have to search for your car model on Amazon, or figure out a comparable model AERO has an Amazon listing for.</p>
<h3>Wiper life and durability</h3>
<p>In theory, better rubber means better wiper life. But after testing eight different models side-by-side, it seems clear that the premium-replacement market is using basically the same rubber on most models.</p>
<p>Sunlight and oxygen are the big aging factors, but another source of damage is ice, especially if you&#8217;re living in an area where scraping windshields is a daily chore before driving. Sand, road salt and gravel can also damage rubber wiper blades.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Z9QXK/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PIAA&#8217;s Super Silicone</a> wiper has the only significantly different compound we tested, and buyer reports insist their lifespan is much longer. However, we saw no difference in our one year test.</p>
<h3>Streaks</h3>
<p>After the break-in period, we looked for evidence of better or worse performance when it came to actually clearing away water. To keep your windshield streak free, you need even wiper contact.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t see any streaks when we tested with these blades. That&#8217;s not to say they&#8217;re all perfect, though: The ability of a wiper to maintain contact is partly determined by a good match between the shape of the windshield and the design of the support. Even though we didn&#8217;t get streaks or skips with a particular wiper on a particular windshield, it doesn&#8217;t mean everyone will have the same luck.</p>
<p>With beam-type supports, the curvature of the springy backing and the flexibility of the wiper edge have to be just right to get even pressure across the entire wiper blade. If you like beam blades, Bosch bends them in three different curve profiles to help get a better fit. You can check which blade is recommended for your vehicle on <a href="https://www.boschautoparts.com/en/auto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bosch&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
<h3>Chatter resistance</h3>
<p>When your wiper sticks to the windshield rather than gliding smoothly, it can start to make an unpleasant rubbing sound that&#8217;s usually called &#8220;chatter&#8221; in reviews.</p>
<p>Chatter is caused by blades sticking, but the underlying cause is usually uneven pressure. In our tests, beam-type wipers were all prone to some chatter when new or after we cleaned the windshield.</p>
<p>After the break-in period, the problem improved, and none of the wipers were loud enough to be annoying. In our tests, the minor chatter we saw did not leave streaks or gaps in wiping.</p>
<h3>Ice and snow performance</h3>
<p>We didn&#8217;t run tests with this group in ice and snow, but the major factor for winter driving is having wiper blades freeze from collected snow and ice. Beam-type blade supports don&#8217;t have as much structure to catch snow, so they’re always less prone to problems.</p>

<p>Of all the wipers we tested, the premium-brand <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015JTJNQI/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rain-X &#8211; Latitude</a> wipers seemed the most questionable value in the beginning. But after we checked the Rain-X compatibility and saw how many different vehicles they support with this wiper, we started to warm up to the brand. An easy installation secured Rain-X&#8217;s position.</p>
<p>Rain-X is one of the few brands that sells a beam-support wiper with an included bracket for a full range of wiper-arm types. Basic instructions are included on an insert in the box, but the video installation guides on the Rain-X website are even more thorough in covering the different install procedures for each type of wiper arm.</p>
<p>This wide compatibility means that if you&#8217;re buying new blades, the only question you really need to answer when locating the right Rain-X wiper is length. In comparison, other brands present you with entirely different wiper types for various attachment systems. We love that we can recommend the Rain-X wiper blade and know people will be able to install it easily.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a big enough car nerd to remember which attachment system your cars and trucks use, there are other windshield wipers that would be a better value.</p>

Instructions are easy to follow, and the cost is fairly low. The water-repellent treatment doesn't last long, but it's a perk. The only downside is if your windshield has curves that are tricky to fit.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015JTJNQI/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Rain-X is best known for their liquid windshield conditioner. Applying silicone oil (dimethylpolysiloxane) as a water repellent makes a lot of sense, and many good windshield washer fluid formulas include it.</p>
<p>Putting that treatment on a wiper blade as a hard coating, though, is a less obvious method of application. These wipers do leave some silicone behind for a few weeks, but after that they&#8217;re pretty normal beam-style wipers. If cost were the biggest difference, we&#8217;d say spend the money on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MXMCDYX/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a bottle of Rain-X</a> instead of upgraded wipers.</p>
<h3>Possible fit issues</h3>
<p>Some user reviews report streaking problems with the Rain-X wiper blades. In our four weeks of testing and a follow-up test after a year in the sun, we didn&#8217;t see any streaks.</p>
<p>It seems likely that the streaks reported by these users were caused by uneven contact between the wiper edge and the windshield.</p>

<p>Beam-support wipers can&#8217;t respond as well to curvature in the middle of the wiper path, but we&#8217;ve also seen reports of a bad fit with traditional support brackets. If you&#8217;re having difficulty with streaks, the Bosch &#8211; Icon wipers have a better reputation for perfect fit.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015JTJNQI/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rain-X &#8211; Latitude</a> wipers performed well in all of our tests.</li>
<li>These are beam-support wipers, so they look good and won&#8217;t accumulate as much snow as traditional wipers.</li>
<li>This is one of the few beam-type brands that gives you a complete set of adapters built in to the wiper, so you won&#8217;t have to hunt for the right model to fit your car.</li>

<p>If you find that other beam-type wiper blades don&#8217;t clean all of your windscreen effectively, we suggest trying the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JU5VUK/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; Icon</a> beam-type blades.</p>
<p>Bosch is one of the few manufacturers to make their beam-type wipers with a different bend radius for different cars. The driver&#8217;s side almost always gets an &#8220;A&#8221; curvature, since it&#8217;s a wide wiper working on the flattest part of the windshield.</p>
<p>For the passenger side, Bosch designates a B or sometimes an original equipment (OE) specific curve to match shorter wiper blades to a tighter curve.</p>
<p>Even pressure across the edge of the wiper is essential to good performance, but Bosch also sells their wipers with specific brackets to fit different wiper arms. If you&#8217;ve got a German or British automobile, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll need the OE variant.</p>
<p>In a few cases, even the adapters included in the Icon package won&#8217;t fit your car. So it&#8217;s important to always <a href="https://www.boschautoparts.com/en/auto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check for compatibility on the wiper manufacturer&#8217;s website</a> before you buy.</p>
<p>While Bosch does have a complete database of automobiles with links to each wiper that will fit your vehicle, the company doesn&#8217;t fully explain the differences between their products. The Icon line is popular and easy to find at parts stores or online; but if you have a car that Bosch doesn&#8217;t make an Icon wiper for, it&#8217;s hard to say what your next-best fit will be.</p>

If you see streaks with other brands, Bosch is worth a try. There are three different models (A, B and OE) for each length, check the Bosch website to see which is right for your vehicle.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JU5VUK/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>When buying auto parts online, remember that Amazon&#8217;s compatibility database is often inaccurate. Always check the manufacturer&#8217;s compatibility list if you&#8217;re doubtful about what length or attachment system you have.</p>
<p>We should note that the installation for the Bosch adapters wasn&#8217;t as intuitive as expected. If you throw away the cardboard on the back of the box, you might have difficulty finding Bosch’s installation instructions elsewhere since they have so many wiper types.</p>
<p>Bosch’s wiper is definitely the sleekest of all the beam-type blades we tested. If you want blades that look great, this is probably your best bet.</p>

<p>In use, these Bosch wipers work very well. We didn&#8217;t have any concerns with squeaking, streaking or wear. That said, these are premium wipers that cost nearly four times more than other brands.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need the specialized fit of Bosch wipers, their cost is  hard to justify. Had it been easier to find the right blade for particular vehicles, Bosch would probably have taken first place in our round-up. As it is, we hope we won&#8217;t have to use the clunky vehicle selection system on Bosch&#8217;s website again.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PL2IAY/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; Excel+</a> is the premium version of Bosch&#8217;s traditional wiper design. At about double the price of economy designs like Anco, these wipers aren’t cheap.</p>
<p>Excel+ wipers are better built than budget wipers, though, and since they&#8217;re fairly easy to find, they&#8217;ll almost always be less expensive than a brand-specific original part.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re lucky, these are even nicer than the wipers that came with your car for far less money than you&#8217;d pay at the dealer&#8217;s parts counter.</p>
<p>With a traditional support bracket compared to the beam supports on our top picks, the Excel+ won&#8217;t be quite as good in the snow. Plenty of drivers get by with wipers like the Excel+ in snowy places, but beam designs are a nice upgrade.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Z9QXK/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PIAA&#8217;s Super Silicone blades</a> have an amazing reputation among car enthusiasts as long-lasting wiper blades. Some claim that they last decades longer than rubber wipers. Those reports are difficult to verify, because it’s very rare that any two cars (even if owned by the same person) would get exactly the same exposure to the sun.</p>
<p>PIAA also claims that the silicone from their wipers will leave a water-repellent coating on your windshield. In theory, this is similar to the coated Rain-X blades; the effect, however, should be longer-lasting, since the silicone oils come from the blade itself and are not just a coating.</p>
<p>We like the PIAA blades, and it&#8217;s clear that they care about making them well. <strong>PIAA also includes a cleaning and silicone treatment wipe with the wiper that will help boost the water-repellent effect while you&#8217;re breaking in the blades.</strong></p>
<p>In a side-by-side test, a PIAA blade running on the PIAA treatment and the Rain-X blade running on Rain-X performed the same. Both wiped well, and the water was obviously beading up and rolling off more easily than on an untreated area.</p>
<p>If we take for granted that the silicone blades will survive two years instead of one year, they&#8217;re a better value than Rain-X or Bosch. Lifespan is only a part of what&#8217;s important, though: you still need to make sure they fit well.</p>
<p>The Super Silicone wipers were a good fit on our car, but note that the Super Silicone model only works with a J-hook attachment. PIAA includes four different sizes so you can get an exact fit; but if you want silicone blades with a vehicle that uses other attachment systems, your best bet is the more expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BT8DMI/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PIAA &#8211; Si-Tech</a> blade.</p>

<p>For a reasonable price, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000CD6GLM/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Valeo &#8211; Ultimate</a> wipers should work just as the premium brands for most people. Valeo isn&#8217;t a name you&#8217;re likely to recognize, but like Bosch, this French company is making original parts for cars worldwide.</p>
<p>We like these beam-type wipers very much, and they performed well. The look of these &#8220;ultimate&#8221; wipers is really the only place we had issues: Valeo uses a thinner rubber spoiler fin on the top side of the wiper, so you can see the painted steel (and even what looks like a batch number) underneath.</p>
<p>As an original equipment manufacturer, Valeo makes wipers to fit a wide range of cars, so <a href="https://www.valeoservice.us/en-us/catalogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check their fit guide</a> if you have something different than the typical J-hook attachment system.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018R88VM/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Denso &#8211; First Time Fit</a> wipers are pretty ordinary, and Denso probably made the factory-original wipers on our test car, a Toyota Corolla.</p>
<p>If you want a real factory-original equivalent part, Denso is the second-largest original equipment parts manufacturer in the world. The First Time Fit line is designed explicitly to give you the right parts without bulky adapters.</p>
<p>These wipers are well-made, and Denso has parts to fit a wide range of vehicles. For the amount we paid, though, the benefits of beam-type wipers in the snow (and in terms of looks) make those models an obvious upgrade.</p>

<p>When we looked closely at all of the wipers we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009IK742/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anco &#8211; AeroVantage</a> was the only design that showed obvious cost-cutting. Where other brands use through-hole rivets to support the back-and-forth pivot of the support arms, Anco uses bent-over tabs.</p>
<p>Anco&#8217;s rubber blade also seems like it might be cut from a longer extruded piece and clamped in place with the steel supports and backing, compared to the more secure molded rubber on other wipers. This design allows the blade to slide back and forth as much as an inch along its track.</p>
<p>These blades wiped well in our test, and that makes their incredibly low price enticing: They go for about half the price of most wipers and a quarter of the cost of the PIAA blades. The security of the other wipers definitely feels worth the extra money, though, and should mean more even pressure on trickier windshields than ours.</p>

<p>If you like the low-profile beam shape but you&#8217;re not especially picky about special coatings, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RW7X1QE/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AERO &#8211; Premium All-Season windshield wiper blades</a> are a great buy. At less than $20 a pair, you get a great high-end look and the same good wiping performance as most of the other blades we tested.</p>
<p>We passed on making AERO a runner-up for a few reasons. The J-hook attachment style is popular and works on our test vehicle, but AERO doesn&#8217;t make it easy to buy their Multifunction Wiper model with a universal adapter. There are listings on Amazon (the main retailer for AERO) for some vehicle-specific models, but they all use the same images as the J-hook version, so it&#8217;s hard to tell what clips they include.</p>
<p>AERO has a 10 percent rate of one-star reviews on this item, which is not far outside the norm. The majority of purchasers seemed to have the same great experience we did, but some reviewers found that these wipers skip entire sections of their windshields.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Good windshield wipers can make the difference between seeing well in bad weather and not seeing at all. Windshield wipers can last for a very long time, but if you notice any reduced visibility, and washing the blades doesn&#8217;t help, it&#8217;s time to buy new blades.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re buying a windshield wiper because your old blades are falling off, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015JTJNQI/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rain-X &#8211; Latitude</a> blades are a nice upgrade from most original equipment and should fit nearly any car. Make sure to check or look up the length of your current wipers so you know which blades to get.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been unhappy about streaks and noises from other wiper blades, it&#8217;s worth checking out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JU5VUK/?tag=ybdwiper-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bosch &#8211; Icon</a> blades. They&#8217;re designed in three different curvatures to fit different window shapes, and they&#8217;re a little bit sleeker than the Rain-X blades.</p>

<h2 id="difference">The difference between a handheld and car vacuum</h2>
<p>Car vacuums are similar to handheld vacuums in terms of portability, but they are specifically designed to clean the interior of a car effectively. You <i>can</i> use any <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">handheld vacuum</a> to clean your car, but car vacuums are specifically designed to allow you to get into tight spaces, with specialized attachments for spaces between and underneath your seats, behind your pedals and in door pockets. Plus, most car vacuums will come with brushes to clean dust in the air vents and console spaces without leaving scratches.</p>
<p>Car vacuums also need to be powerful enough to get all kinds of dirt. Think stubborn sand from the beach, mud and rocks from hikes, ground up crumbs compliments of your toddler or hair left behind by your beloved pet. We chose to test dedicated car vacuums or handheld vacuums that have attachments specifically designed for your vehicle.</p>
<p>So who can use a car vacuum? If you have kids or pets, a car vacuum is a must-have. If you clean your own car, or want a handy instrument to keep your car spotless in between professional cleanings, a car vacuum is for you.</p>
<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are many car vacuums available, so we spent hours narrowing down the best on the market.</p>
<p>We checked out subreddits, considered the findings from reviewers like Wirecutter and automotive websites, as well as vacuum specialty sites. Once we had input from the car and vacuum professionals, we were able to determine which features consumers value the most in a car vacuum. We found that consumers and car detailers alike consider power to be the most important factor in choosing a car vacuum. Other considerations are battery life and run time (for cordless models), and ease in reaching narrow spaces in a vehicle.</p>
<p>Based on our research, we looked for car vacuums that met our key metrics, such as a powerful suction, thanks to a strong motor and adequate air watts, strong battery and useful attachments to get to hard-to-reach dirt. For cordless vacuums, we looked at models with lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries (as opposed to NiCd batteries) because Li-ion batteries have higher power density, resulting in longer lasting power. We also considered customer feedback on the vacuums and filtered out any models that seemed to have recurring issues.</p>
<p>With these details in mind, we selected eight finalists to review. Over the course of six weeks, we put them through a series of tests to judge their performance and ease of use.</p>

<p>Considering whether you need a cordless or corded vacuum? It really all depends on your circumstances. If you are cleaning your car in a garage with an AC outlet nearby, a corded vacuum may be for you. You don’t need to think about charging the vacuum, nor do you have to worry about the vacuum losing power as the battery loses its charge (this is a complaint many consumers have voiced about battery-charged vacuums). Corded options often (but not always) boast more powerful suction. Corded versions come in sizes small and large (like the Armor All), whereas cordless models tend to be more compact.</p>
<p>If being tethered to an electrical outlet sounds like an inconvenience to you or you plan to use your vacuum on the go, a cordless model may be more suited to your needs. You can use the cordless vacuums essentially anywhere, but unlike the corded option, you do need to remember to keep it charged. In our testing, we found that cordless vacuums made it easier to get into the deepest places in our cars without a cord getting caught in the car door or on a tire. The cordless options we tested gave us plenty of time to clean one car. With close to 20 minutes of running time, the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot allowed us to get most of the way through cleaning a second car before we needed to recharge it.</p>
<p>As a third option, some car vacuums, such as the Baabyoo, plug into the 12-volt outlet in your car. This makes the vacuum super convenient for cleaning your car and offers a consistent power source. However, 12V outlet functionality limits you to using the vacuum only in your car.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3><b>Suction power</b></h3>
<p>Power is key to ensuring that you have enough suction to get the job done in a timely manner. Who wants to vacuum the same mess over and over again to get it cleaned up? Different manufacturers measure power in different ways (amps, air watts and/or air flow). We looked at cordless vacuums that ranged from 15 to 35 air watts, which refers to the amount of watts it takes to carry a unit of air through the vacuum, as well as corded vacuums with motors that boasted at least 4 amps.</p>
<h3><b>Attachments</b></h3>
<p>Consider all the nooks and crannies in your car, from between the seats and the door side pocket to the heating/air vents that collect dust. You need a vacuum that can get to all of them.The attachments on a car vacuum are very important since you need to clean many different areas and materials — from plastic and burl wood, to leather, fabric and carpeting. Did each vacuum have a tool to get in between seats and a brush clean the console without leaving scratches?</p>
<h3><b>Wet/Dry vs. dry</b></h3>
<p>Wet cleaners have a trap for water so that you won’t damage the electrical components of the vacuum while sucking up wet messes. Standard (dry) vacuums don&#8217;t have that protection, so they can short-circuit if you try to suck up moisture. Whether to select a wet/dry vacuum or dry-only vacuum depends on your needs and what kind of messes you deal with on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<h3><b>Tank capacity</b></h3>
<p>Tanks will vary in size, meaning that you may need to empty the tank more or less often. We found that all the car vacuums we tested had sufficient tanks to clean your entire car, even with significant dirt, sand and food crumbs. If you have a space for a larger machine like the Armor All, it boasts the largest tank of all the vacuums we tested (at 2.5 gallons).</p>
<h3><b>Weight/Size</b></h3>
<p>It’s important that car vacuums are lightweight and convenient, so we considered whether any of the vacuums were too large, heavy or unwieldy. The vacuums we tested ranged from the light Baabyoo, weighing in at 2.5 pounds, to the heaviest of the group, the 7-pound Armor All.</p>
<h3><b>Battery runtime</b></h3>
<p>For cordless vacuums, how long can you run the vacuum before you need to recharge? Most batteries will power the vacuum consistently for about 10-15 minutes total, so will that be enough to get through cleaning your entire car before it turns off? With turning it on and off as we worked through our cars, we found that this is typically enough time to get the job done. Our top choice, the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot, lasted closer to 20 minutes and it didn’t lose much power. That’s because it is powered with a 20-volt lithium battery.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Suction</h3>
<p>The suction of a car vacuum is key. To test each one, we spread an eighth of a cup of sand on the same car mat and counted how many passes it took to clean up the mess. We also tested cereal crumbs with each machine and then generally worked around the car to suck up residual dirt and dust on and in between the seats, on the floorboard, behind the gas and brake pedals, and in the console and air conditioning vents.</p>
<p>We found that all the vacuums were able to tackle the messes pretty well, but some just did so more efficiently. We found that sand was the most challenging debris for the vacuums to fully clean, so this became our key comparison test. The Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot cleaned sand in just two to three passes, whereas some others took five to seven passes to fully get the sand up from the car mat.</p>
<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p>We also tested the attachments on each vacuum to see how well worked in a car. All the vacuums we tested had brush and extension attachments, which are essential to fully clean your car.</p>
<p>Several of the machines including the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot, the Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L and the Dirt Devil have the crevice tools and brushes attached. This means that you don’t need to go searching for attachments, which adds to the machines’ convenience. You can just flip the tools up or down depending on what area of the car you need to clean.</p>
<p>Several other vacuums we tested have hose attachments that connect with the body of the vacuums and then stretch into the car for cleaning. These vacuums are effective as well, though it sometimes takes a little more maneuvering to get the body of the vacuum situated in a place that allows you to get the hose and connected attachments where you need to clean in the car.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>Ease of use can mean a lot of things — for example, how comfortable is the vacuum to use and how convenient are the attachments to use? How easy is it to get to the spaces you needed to clean — sometimes at awkward angles?</p>
<p>Based on our testing, we found that cordless vacuums are easiest to navigate in and around our cars. The cords on the corded vacuums can get caught on the car tires and in the doors as you reach into our car.</p>
<p>With that said, we found that vacuums with the longest cords provide a better cleaning experience than those with short cords. At 18 feet, the Bissell has the longest cord, which makes a huge difference in allowing you to access all the places you need to vacuum in a car. The Armor All has the shortest cord of the group (only 10 feet), which means that in most cases, an extension cord is needed.</p>
<p>We also looked at how the collection bins and filters worked on each of the vacuums and determined which were the most difficult to disassemble and clean. Most were fairly straightforward once we figured out how the vacuums opened. We had a bit of concern about the Armor All. While it worked well to clean spills — including wet and dry messes — you have to switch out the filter for wet versus dry material. It’s not difficult, but if you forget to switch the filter out, you can short out the motor.</p>

<p>By the time we finished our testing, the leader of the pack was quite clear. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOEFBKS/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot</a> had the strongest suction at 35 air watts and did the best job on tough dirt and sand.</p>
<p>Its wide mouth was effective on car seats and mats, while the attached crevice tool and brush allowed us to conveniently get into the smallest crevices in the car. The pivot design made it so that the vacuum could clean at odd angles, which minimized the craning and stretching we had to do. We found it much more comfortable to clean with than the fixed nose of the Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L model.</p>
<p>We love that the crevice tool and brush, which can get to hard-to-reach spaces, is attached to the machine. You can also purchase an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DP737HW/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">additional Car Accessory Kit</a>, which includes a flexible hose that stretches up for 4 feet, large brush attachment and storage bag. While the vacuum itself has an attached brush attachment that we found more than adequate, these extra attachments might come in handy for the most fastidious car owner.</p>
<p>This model is a battery-powered product, which in the end, we felt was most convenient for cleaning a car. The vacuum’s power stayed strong for about 20 minutes before it needed a recharge. This was plenty of time to clean the car effectively without feeling the need to hurry.</p>

Its pivot design meant we could reach every crevice of the car.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LZQGN6/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>While this vacuum boasts strong power and convenience, it also has a three-stage filtration system to help trap allergens. The Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot also boasts a translucent bagless dust collector so that you can see the dirt you have captured, and how much space you have left before needing to empty it. We found that the dust collector had plenty of space left over after we finished our vacuuming sessions.</p>
<p>When we cleaned out the vacuum’s collection bin, the process was straightforward. You can simply empty the contents into the trash, or depending on the mess you just cleaned up, you can also wash the plastic in the sink to get it fully clean. Once you are done, the vacuum can also be folded in half for convenient storage.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The pivot design on the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot helped us get into corners and odd angles of a car. The vacuum was also ergonomic and comfortable to use.</li>
<li>It cleaned sand and other dirt with the least amount of passes, thanks to its powerful suction.</li>
<li>The battery lasted as long as we needed it and did not lose power along the way.</li>
<li>The machine has plenty of capacity for dirt, was easy to clean out and has a triple filtration system to ensure that you aren’t breathing the dirt and dust you are trying to clean.</li>

<p>Our favorite car vacuum with a cord was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KCMH7A/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell</a>. It provided strong suction with a 4-amp motor and effectively cleaned up the sand we spilled in just three passes. It was the only vacuum we tested with a rubber attachment, which makes capturing pet hair easier.</p>
<p>We loved that the Bissell is effective in cleaning <i>all </i>parts of a car. Its wide suction area is great for car mats and seats, while its hose and attachments allow you to get into the nooks and crannies. This is unlike some of the other vacuums we tested, like the Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L, which has a narrow opening, making it take much longer to thoroughly clean the mats and seats in a vehicle.</p>
<p>The cord on this model is 18 feet, which makes a significant difference in accessing all areas of the car. It is significantly longer than the other options we tested, including the shortest cord of the pack, on the Armor All, measuring in at only 10 feet. If you have a garage with an AC power outlet that is accessible to your car and you don’t want to have to worry about charging your car vacuum before using it, this model is an excellent option. It also has a cord wrap system for convenient storage.</p>
<p>Not only is it powerful with a conveniently long cord, but the Bissell also has a large collection bin so that you can clean your car multiple times without having to empty it. The section of the vacuum that collects the dirt is clear, so you can see when it is getting full. It pops off easily for emptying. This vacuum also boasts a HEPA filter, which is important for cutting down on allergens that you may breathe in while vacuuming your car.</p>

<p>At 4.7 pounds, this model is a little heavier than some of the other options, including our top pick, the Black and Decker -BDH2000PL Pivot, which is only 3 pounds, but it still felt comfortable to hold while we cleaned. Because this model has a hose that attaches to the vacuum body, you can use the hose with attachments throughout your car, without having to constantly move the base of the vacuum.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bissell &#8211; Cleanview Deluxe provides strong — and consistent power — to take care of even the biggest messes or the most stubborn dirt.</li>
<li>The wide suction area is great for seats and mats in your car, while the attachments do a good job in the hard-to-reach areas.</li>
<li>You don’t need to worry about charging the battery before use.</li>
<li>The collection bin was roomy enough to handle several cleaning sessions without having to be emptied.</li>
<li>A HEPA filter helps minimize allergens.</li>

<p>Editors note: The item we originally tested was the Vacplus, which has been out of stock since November. We found an identical rebrand of it from a company named Baabyoo, which we&#8217;ve replaced mentions of Vacplus throughout the article with.</p>
<p>At a budget-friendly price, we liked the functionality of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTYLV9G/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baabyoo</a>, which plugs into the 12V power outlet in your car. This was one of the more compact vacuums of the group we tested, but it packed plenty of power to clean sand, crumbs and more. If you experience wet and dry messes in your car, this is a great option for you, as it will seamlessly handle either type of spill.</p>
<p>We found the power on the Baabyoo adequate to get the job done and because it plugs into a 12V outlet in your car, you don’t have to worry about periodically needing to charge it. In addition to trying this vacuum on sand, we cleaned wet mud from the car and found that it did well on wet messes, which makes it a good option for those who often find themselves at the beach, on hiking trips or those with children who are spilling milk or juice. If a spill or mess happens while you are away from your home or on a road trip, you can still use the vacuum without needing a wall outlet or battery charger.</p>
<p>In addition to offering consistent suction, this vacuum has several attachments that are very effective in reaching between car seats and capturing dust in car consoles. All the attachments fit with the vacuum in a nylon zipper bag, making storage of this model in your car or trunk simple and convenient.</p>
<p>We found one user that had a problem with the attachments staying attached, but he reported back later on that the company saw the review and replaced his defective unit.</p>

It’s powered by your vehicle’s DC V12 power outlet, which means you don’t need to worry about charging it before use.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTYLV9G/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Cleaning the machine — even with wet messes — was straightforward. The collection bin pops off and can be rinsed with water and soap when needed. The collection bin is not clear, on some of the other models like the Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot, Holife or Bissell models, so you do have to check from time to time to ensure that you haven’t filled the vacuum with dust.</p>
<p>A drawback of this machine is it can <i>only </i>be powered by a 12V outlet. If you want to use your car vacuum for other spills from time to time in your garage or elsewhere, you may want to consider a traditional corded vacuum model or one with a dedicated battery charger.</p>
<p>As our budget selection, this vacuum is priced around $20. It offers a great bang for your buck if you wish to keep a dedicated car vacuum in your vehicle.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Baabyoo provides strong and consistent power to clean your car, using the 12V outlet in your vehicle.</li>
<li>It cleans up wet/dry messes.</li>
<li>A convenient nylon bag comes with the vacuum for storage.</li>
<li>It is the most budget-friendly option at around $20.</li>

<p>We loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00445L290/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carrand</a> for its attachments, which were very clearly designed for the car — more so than any of the other car vacuums we tested. It even has an attachment to buff the console. It also has several attachments to clean cup holders, air vents and the console without leaving scratches.</p>
<p>This vacuum had very strong suction, taking care of our sand test in just two passes. The Carrand is bulkier than some of the other options. The vacuum itself sits on the ground, with a hose to reach into your car for cleaning. Since this is a corded model, you are tethered to your garage’s AC outlet. The length of the cord is on the shorter side at 12 feet, so an extension cord might come in handy depending on how close you can get your car to your power outlet.</p>
<p>The machine blows warm air, which the company describes as a minimal resistance design that allows air to ﬂow more freely for more cleaning power. We didn’t have any problem with the air flow — it did not seem to cause allergies, but those who are very sensitive to dust might want to take this feature into consideration.</p>
<p>The main drawback we found with this particular model is the storage for the attachments, which is at the side of the base of the vacuum. As we reached into the car to vacuum a seat, the movement of the hose knocked the attachments loose onto the garage floor. Even despite the attachment storage issue, anyone who is concerned about getting every possible nook and cranny of their car will still want to consider the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00445L290/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carrand.</a></p>
<h3>Holife &#8211; Hand Vacuum Cleaner</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYVDGFK/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holife &#8211; Hand Vacuum Cleaner</a> is a strong contender in the car vacuum arena. It is easy to use and picks up all kinds of dirt with ease. We were able to tackle the sand we spread out as part of our testing, as well as cereal crumbs and even a few stray chips in the car, thanks to the large suction opening. The large opening also made it possible to vacuum our car mats and seats efficiently.</p>
<p>The attachments for this model are not connected to the vacuum itself but they are easy to connect and they allow you to reach the smaller spaces of the car. The machine is relatively light, so it made maneuvering through the car easy.</p>
<p>The dirt and debris that you pick up shows through the clear collection bin so that you can see when you need to empty it. Emptying the bin took a little bit of figuring out with several pieces to disconnect, but once we figured it out, the process wasn’t too cumbersome. The Holife can handle wet and dry messes and the collection bin can be washed out with soap and water to clean up after cleaning wet messes. The vacuum comes with two washable filters, which is great because you can reuse them over and over.</p>
<p>While the vacuum picked up all kinds of dirt effectively, we did notice that that the Holife seemed to lose some of its suction as the collection bin filled up and the battery wore down.</p>
<h3>Armor All &#8211; 2.5 Gallon Utility Wet/Dry Vacuum</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17248" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/armorall-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The largest of the models we tested — the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003M2F7NI/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Armor All </a>— will hold plenty of dirt and grime in its 2.5-gallon container. During our testing, it proved powerful enough to aptly pick up dirt, cereal and dust in the car. The attachments also allowed us to dirt in between our car seats effectively. It also handled wet spills like water and mud.</p>
<p>This vacuum is significantly larger than most of the vacuums we tested, with the exception of the Carrand. The garage where we tested this machine is tight on space and we found it difficult to move the vacuum around the car in the limited space. It was easier to pull the car out into the driveway and use an extension cord (the cord that comes with his machine is quite short at only 10 feet long).</p>
<p>While we found this hard to use in tight spaces, if you have a large garage or need a small shop vac that will double for cleaning your car, this is a great option. If you are only looking for a convenient car vacuum, there are other smaller options, such as the corded Bissell or the cordless Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot, which we felt were easier to maneuver and had just as strong suction. If you need a small wet/dry vacuum, the Baabyoo or Holife are also solid contenders.</p>
<p>While we found that this works well to clean wet and dry spills, you have to switch out the filter for wet versus dry material, which can be a bit of an inconvenience. It is something to be aware of because if you forget to swap the filter before cleaning up a wet spill, you risk shorting the motor.</p>
<h3>Dirt Devil &#8211; Scorpion</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002D47XOM/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Scorpion</a> is one of the more budget-friendly options in the group of car vacuums. It has a streamlined design which is comfortable to hold, though the machine felt heavier than some of the others. It is also very loud.</p>
<p>The power of this vacuum was acceptable. Because it is corded, you don’t need to worry about ebbs and flows of power. The cord measures 16 feet, which is long enough, though we had to do some maneuvering at times during our testing. In terms of suction, it took about four passes to collect the sand we spread out and did a good job on crumbs as well. The crevice tool worked in between the seats, and we liked that it was connected, so we didn’t have to go looking for the right attachment.</p>
<p>After some use in our car, however, we turned the vacuum back on and it sprayed out a burst of dust that hit us in the face. While we liked other aspects of this car vacuum, this turned us off to this model entirely. We checked to see if other reviewers experienced the same and we found several who wrote about this problem, blaming a poorly constructed filter.</p>
<h3>Black and Decker &#8211; CHB1410L</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17251" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blackanddeckerblue-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We expected the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006LXOJC0/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L</a> to be one of the easiest vacuums to use and liked that it was light and compact. However, we were disappointed with its power and overall effectiveness in cleaning a car. The long “nose” of the machine made it more difficult to get at different angles in our car. Also, because the nose doesn’t have a wide opening, it takes longer to clean the larger sections in our car, such as seats and mats.</p>
<p>While some of the other machines took care of the sand we spilled in the car in just two to three passes, we found that this model was not as effective. Despite repeated passes of the vacuum, we could never quite get all the sand out of the floor mat with this model.</p>
<p>While the power was lacking on this model, we did like that the Black and Decker &#8211; CHV1410L has an attached brush to easily clean the console and dusty areas of the car without scratches. Still, it was just not as effective as the other machines actually capturing all the dust.</p>
<p>Another feature on this model that we liked is that the lithium battery charger automatically shuts off when the battery is charged. This is a great safety feature and it also allows you to conveniently store the machine on the charger without worrying about draining the battery. But in the end, the lack of suction and design flaws for cleaning a car made this our least favorite of the car vacuums we tested.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There are many variables when it comes to choosing a car vacuum. Do you want a cordless or corded model? Do you need a vacuum that can also work on wet spills? These decisions will depend on your garage set-up and what messes you’ll typically be cleaning up.</p>
<p>After testing eight of the top car vacuums, we feel that the cordless models are the most convenient to use in a car. While the batteries don’t last forever, we found that most of the models we tested last long enough to get the entire car clean before needing a recharge.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOEFBKS/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black and Decker &#8211; BDH2000PL Pivot</a> is our favorite model when it comes to power, ergonomic design and effectiveness in picking up even the most ground-in dirt. During testing, the pivot design allowed us to comfortably get to dirt in hard-to-reach spaces. It has a crevice and brush tool attached, which is convenient as you are working through your car, and both tools did a good job getting at dirt and dust. In addition, if you want additional attachments, you can purchase them as add-ons, giving you the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>We also feel confident recommending the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KCMH7A/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell</a> if a corded car vacuum fits your needs. This model is sturdy and powerful. Its wide mouth is effective on seats and mats, while its attachments do a great job with dirt in the deepest crevices of a car.</p>
<p>And last, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTYLV9G/?tag=ybdcv-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baabyoo</a>, which plugs into a car’s 12V power outlet, is our budget pick, which as a bonus, can handle both wet and dry spills.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After six weeks of testing, we think the best reel for efficiently spooling and storing your garden hose is the Suncast - Hose Hideaway]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter six weeks of washing cars, watering plants, hosing off toys and performing other backyard chores with five contenders, we think the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FJF8P8//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Suncast &#8211; Swivel Hose Hideaway</a> is the best hose reel. This &#8220;hose hideaway&#8221; not only keeps your hose out of sight, it also makes coiling and using your hose much easier than any other affordable reel we could find. For a more heavy-duty reel that will survive longer but doesn&#8217;t have as many features, the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00080FGME//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Liberty &#8211; 703-1</a> is hard to beat.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Research for this category was tricky, since there are so many different models and styles available, and since the flaws that kill a hose reel depend mostly on how much abuse you&#8217;re putting it through.</p>
<p>As always, we scanned the retailer pages for ratings and user reviews and found that most people were fairly forgiving of garden hose reel design; so long as a reel works and doesn&#8217;t break right away, most people are happy with what they get.</p>
<p>In the end, we tried three reels made of plastic and two made from steel. We splurged a bit on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00261PYMA//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eley &#8211; Rapid Reel</a>, if only to see how much better a really expensive model is.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVDasQuyeU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powerwind</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jh7iGsdrYI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aquawind</a> features on other Suncaster models looked like features that would make the reel too much of a pain to set up and use for the little benefit offered, so we skipped them.</p>
<p>We also checked into designs that are basically <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0742M8X6N?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">air hose reels</a>. They&#8217;re retractable and durable, but you&#8217;ll see <a href="https://terrylove.com/forums/index.php?threads/air-hose-reel-used-as-garden-hose-reel.20407/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dramatic reduction in flow</a> with the tiny-diameter hoses they come with. We decided to only look at reels that will work with the hose you already have.</p>
<p>A big, heavy-duty garden hose cart with wheels sounds like a great idea, but the affordable products we found have terrible reviews. Reviews of the four-wheel carts we looked at had reports of nightmarishly difficult assembly and raised big questions about long-term durability. We bought two plastic two-wheeled carts because they’re cheap and popular; the metal two-wheel designs all seem to have stability issues and even those cost a lot more money than we expected.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>For a month of spring yard work, we used these hose reels with 50 feet of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose/" rel="noopener">our favorite Craftsman rubber hose</a> and two 100-foot lengths of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/WaterWorks-5-8-in-Dia-x-100-ft-Commercial-Duty-Garden-Hose-WWMFT58100/203895464" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the cheapest, stiffest hose we could find</a>.</p>
<p>Setting up each hose reel required slightly different steps, but only the most expensive hose reel actually required any setup work: The Eley came as a box of parts and fasteners. (They were very nice fasteners, though, and the custom-made giant Allen wrench is well made.)</p>
<p>We then moved through a series of specific tests to pinpoint any strengths or flaws in the designs of these reels.</p>
<h3>Build quality</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-12105 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup.jpg" alt="Close-up of hose fitting" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/build-quality-closeup-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
We ranked the reels based on how we felt about the materials and design after testing. All the plastic reels scored a three here; we didn&#8217;t note anything that made a particular reel feel sub-standard. The Eley, naturally, scored a perfect five — it&#8217;s practically a showpiece for careful manufacturing with good materials.</p>
<h3>Coiling and uncoiling at capacity</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hose-reel-clip.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The way a reel coils and pays out hose is really the most important thing about it and we were surprised at the way our most expensive reel, the Eley, bunched up and overlapped the hose as we used it.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Smart Trak system on the Suncaster &#8211; Swivel Hose Hideaway won us over immediately with fast, even, tight coiling. It&#8217;s not perfect; if you feed a tight kink into the guide it&#8217;ll probably mess up your winding job. That said, if you lay out your hose so it has room to untwist, even a stiff vinyl hose will wind very easily.</p>
<p>We tested the capacity of the reels with the same hose to see how they compare to each other: the manufacturers rate their reel capacity based on some unknown ⅝&#8221; hose and they don&#8217;t specify how picky they were about neat winding.</p>
<h3>Leak tests</h3>

The cheap hoses we tested with only had basic gaskets and we tightened by hand.</p>
<p>The Liberty and Ames reels were the only ones that dripped. The Liberty stopped dripping after we gave the inlet fittings (where the included leader hose connects) some more torque by hand.</p>
<p>The Ames &#8211; Fold &amp; Store was leaking at the elbow-shaped outlet fitting where your <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose/">garden hose</a> attaches to the reel and because of the side-pressure our stiff hose put on it, the Ames never stopped leaking while the hose was coiled.</p>
<h2 id="best-for-long">Top pick: Suncast &#8211; Swivel Hose Hideaway</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FJF8P8//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suncast &#8211; CPLSSM200B Swivel Hose Hideway</a> is, all things considered, just a plastic garden hose reel. This model has a limited lifespan and reviews indicate the plastic hose fitting on the side won&#8217;t survive abuse. It&#8217;s not going to spontaneously fall apart but manage your expectations.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind, this is an amazing reel for long hoses. We picked this model because it has a built-in winding guide (called a &#8220;level-winder unit&#8221; in industrial spooling applications for rope or cable) that keeps the hose evenly distributed so it doesn&#8217;t bunch or overlap on the reel.</p>
<p>We used two of the cheapest, stiffest 100-foot-long hoses we could find and this reel wrapped up 240 feet without any need to rewrap or correct any overlaps on the spool that could cause binding.</p>
<p>The swiveling base of this hose reel is another great feature when you&#8217;ve got a super-long hose that you&#8217;re dragging all over the yard. The swivel means the hose can roll or unroll easily no matter what side of your lawn you go to, even if you stake down the base.</p>
<p>Note that no stakes came with ours, thought the parts list says they should be included. We really do recommend staking down a reel with an extra-long hose. If you don&#8217;t, this box is light enough to drag across the grass or concrete when you&#8217;re struggling with a long hose.</p>

It's the only reel we found for less than $100 with this feature, and the swiveling base also makes working with a long hose much easier.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FJF8P8//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Suncaster has a version of this reel with <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Suncast-225-ft-Smart-Trak-Wicker-Hideaway-Hose-Reel-with-Brass-In-Out-Tube-CPLSMW212/206093654" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">upgraded brass fittings</a> (though without the swiveling base) that we considered, but on the whole, the parts upgraded (internal tubes and threads) don&#8217;t seem to be the first to wear out. It&#8217;s the retaining clips that keep the inlet assembly together that give up first if you put a strain on the inlet hose, so we wish they would reinforce that part instead.</p>
<p>The biggest beef we have with this design is that the inlet hose fitting doesn&#8217;t have a spinning coupler: attach the hose to the reel side before you attach to your supply, or you&#8217;ll find yourself trying to figure out how to spin the entire box around to get the hose screwed in.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Suncast &#8211; Swivel Hose Hideaway easily wraps even 200-foot-long hoses in a neat, even spool.</li>
<li>This model effectively turns a giant pile of hose into an innocuous piece of yard furniture.</li>
<li>The swiveling base makes using and coiling a long hose that much easier.</li>
<li>You can usually find this for less than $70, so it&#8217;s a bargain for its size and features.</li>
<li>Long-term durability concerns are our only real pause.</li>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00080FGME//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> 703-1 is an entry-level steel reel from Liberty</a> and it represents a great value for someone who&#8217;s tired of plastic garden tools.</p>
<p>Compared to the plastic reels, this is a bit heavier and inspires a lot more confidence. It isn&#8217;t that attractive — the beige powder-coating is fine, but the mixed zinc-plated and cast-brass fittings on the side are kind of hideous. You could mount this on your wall, but if that&#8217;s your plan you should know that Liberty makes more <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GUJT7CC/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">decorative options</a> that aren&#8217;t available in a freestanding style.</p>

<p>Compared to the Eley (which will set you back $100 more) this isn&#8217;t as nice, but the parallel side flanges on this reel caused fewer problems when winding. It&#8217;s also balanced lower to the ground, so it&#8217;s less likely to tip over if you yank hard on the hose.</p>
<p>The fittings all appear to be off-the-shelf plumbing parts, which means long-term maintenance should be simple. Everything about this reel is a noticeable step down in look and feel from the Eley, but functionally it&#8217;s a better reel.</p>
<p>If you want metal construction and a level-winder guide like our top pick, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N4R6LZH?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Liberty sells one, model 707</a>, but it&#8217;s wall-mount-only and a lot more expensive.</p>
<p>This 703-1 reel is wide and sturdy and only minimal assembly was required. (A couple of wrenches are required for the lock-nuts on the handle.) It leaked around the inlet when we first assembled it, but after we tightened the fitting a bit more it never so much as dripped.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing about this reel is pushing the rubber feet through the holes in the base; you&#8217;ll almost certainly need pliers to get them through. There are four cheap lawn stakes included if you want to keep this on grass instead of concrete.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Liberty &#8211; 703-1 is well-built but still affordable.</li>
<li>Steel components with a powder-coat finish should survive decades of gardening.</li>
<li>Can be wall-mounted or free-standing.</li>
<li>Capacity for almost 200 feet of hose.</li>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t help you wind neatly, but doesn&#8217;t get in the way.</li>

Also from Suncast, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00023BHRA//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hosemobile</a> is a clever little hose cart that fits in any budget, but doesn&#8217;t disappoint when you use it.</p>

<p>Compared with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FL1KBC/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ames &#8211; Fold &amp; Store</a>, it&#8217;s actually pretty shocking how much better this is. The fixes are little things, like the angle of the outlet fitting where your hose connects: it&#8217;s made from the same cheap plastic, but the angle Suncast chose means it doesn&#8217;t force your hose sideways and cause leaks the way the Ames does.</p>
<p>This wheeled design doesn&#8217;t fold up and won&#8217;t take much abuse, but since the reel is only big enough for a smaller hose capacity, you&#8217;re not likely to overload the plastic construction. You could probably load 175 feet of hose if you carefully guide it into an even wrap, but 100-150 feet is a more realistic length if you&#8217;re just spooling quickly.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no guide here to help your hose wrap evenly, but the slot in the handle does have two notches that effectively lock a 5/8&#8243; hose in place. That and other little design touches, like the foot-pedal that sticks out to help you stabilize the reel, help make up for the materials.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Suncast &#8211; Hosemobile was the cheapest hose reel we tested, but it&#8217;s far from the worst.</li>
<li>This isn&#8217;t going to hold a really long and heavy hose, but 150 feet is more than enough for most of us.</li>
<li>The wheels and light weight make it easy to move your coil of hose from the backyard to the front.</li>
</ul>

We bought the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00261PYMA//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eley &#8211; Rapid Reel </a>to see just how much better a hose reel can get if you throw money at the problem. The answer kind of surprised us: this is the nicest hose reel, but it actually doesn&#8217;t do its job as well as the less expensive models we tested.</p>
<p>As expected, the components included are all impressive. Even the purpose-built two-size allen wrench included for assembly is impressive: heavy-duty and with a nice finish. The cast-brass fittings on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0056IVTVU/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the leader hose are gorgeous</a> and easy to grip without tools, a nice upgrade over other cheap pack-in hoses.</p>
<p>The fact that there&#8217;s an adjustable reel brake is a testament to the thought that goes into these reels. Likewise, the loop of webbing that secures the hose to the reel is a nice touch. Neither of those features is really necessary, though.</p>
<p>This reel will undoubtedly survive more weather (and abuse) than a cheap plastic reel, but an extra hundred dollars doesn&#8217;t solve all the problems in the world of garden hose reels. The sloping flanges on either side push the hose toward the center as it winds; if you aren&#8217;t careful when quickly winding a long hose it might start to overlap itself.</p>
<p>We squeezed on 215 feet of hose and the reel still turned freely, but even at 150 feet, the overlapping problem is frustrating. Eley rates this model for 175 feet of standard ⅝&#8221; hose, but we wouldn&#8217;t recommend it as-sold for much more than 125 feet.</p>
<p>Eley sells an <a href="https://www.eleyhosereels.com/products/extra-capacity-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extra-capacity kit</a> to make the reel wider for long hoses and that would make the overlapping and bunching less problematic, but that brings the total cost for your stationary hose reel north of $200. On the bright side, installing the kit gives you an excuse to use that really nice allen wrench again!</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FL1KBC//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ames &#8211; Fold &amp; Store</a> hose cart checks a lot of boxes on the feature list: it folds for storage, it has wheels to make dragging it around easier, it has a storage bin in the bottom and the slot in the handle even works as a built-in winding guide.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that great in person, though. We&#8217;re not going to fault a plastic hose reel for being made from plastic, but the way the outlet fitting sits on the reel means there&#8217;s a lot of strain on it if you use a stiff hose. One of our cheap hoses has a kink-preventing strain relief sleeve that makes the end five inches very stiff; the sideways force against the fitting on this reel make it leak pretty severely.</p>
<p>Cutting off the strain-relief sleeve made our hose fit better, though it still leaked. Some thread-sealing tape or an extra gasket could probably take care of all the leaking, but you shouldn&#8217;t have to use extra tools to get a fit that doesn&#8217;t leak.</p>
<p>The way this reel sits in the frame, the side flanges don&#8217;t have any extra room to bend or expand out before they&#8217;ll start to rub as the reel turns. The flanges are bar-shaped rather than full circles (which does mean it takes up less space when folded), so when you get more than 100 feet of hose loaded they make a repeated &#8220;thwack, thwack, thwack&#8221; as you&#8217;re turning the handle.</p>
<p>The slot in the handle doesn&#8217;t actually do much to keep your hose tidy on the reel, either; mostly it just keeps your <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose-nozzle/">garden hose nozzle</a> in place for storage.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you want a reel that will survive decades of sun, rain and abuse, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00080FGME/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Liberty 703-1</a> is well-built and affordable. It held almost 200 feet of bulky, stiff hose and it should be easy to repair or replace the metal fittings.</p>
<p>For those looking for something more portable, we liked the cheap and easy-to-find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00023BHRA/?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suncast &#8211; Hosemobile</a>. It&#8217;s not going to survive the apocalypse, but if you&#8217;ve got a smaller roll of hose that you want to move from yard to yard this reel will do the job.</p>
<p>If we had to choose one best reel for all our hose needs, though, we&#8217;d take the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FJF8P8//?tag=ybdreel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suncast &#8211; CPLSSM200B</a> Swivel Hose Hideaway. The Smart Trak guide system does a great job of feeding the spool evenly and the swiveling base means you can move around the yard and pull your hose straight off the reel, never binding it against the side.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We’re a hands-on kind of people at Your Best Digs, and our lead editor for this project has worked on his own cars for as long as he’s been driving.</p>
<p>Automotive diagnostics is a wide and complicated field, though, so we also worked with a local expert. Scott McLain is the owner and manager of <a href="http://www.temeculaautocare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temecula Accurate Auto Care</a>, and he helped us narrow down the long list of scan tools and asses their value for real diagnostic work.</p>
<p>We focused on scanners with essential functions like live data readouts and graphs. We capped our budget at $100 per scanner, which eliminates the upper tier of scanners with built-in oscilloscopes and security system programming. However, we still found some impressive features that will help you complete a fix without investing in features most car owners won’t ever need.</p>
<p>As always, we prioritized models with good review scores on sites like Amazon and brands that have a good reputation among enthusiasts on Reddit and other car forums above those that were as cheap as possible. Warranty support is also a consideration, and we looked for tools that can download firmware updates when new features or fixes come along.</p>
<p>The flexibility and power of smartphone or PC-connected diagnostics is amazing, and we took a long, hard look at what’s available for the enthusiast mechanic who wants to get maximum flexibility and power. We chose a variety of Bluetooth-connected OBD-II adapters, and prioritized compatibility and simplicity in our picks.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-obd2">What is ODB-II?</h2>
<p>OBD-II is the second generation of a government-mandated <a href="http://www.oneminuteinfo.com/2014/02/can-bus-obd-ii-explained-for-dummies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“On-Board Diagnostic” communication system</a> for automobiles. This standard has been in place in the U.S. since 1996, and since 2006 international systems are nearly 100% compatible.</p>
<p>The system is built around the emissions monitoring and testing systems that are required by many states in the U.S. If you’ve ever been offered a “pre-test” at a smog shop before you pay for the official test that’s sent to your state registry office, OBD-II is the system that says “this car should pass an emissions test” or “this car has a problem.” Any OBD-II scanner can show you these “emissions readiness” details monitored by your car.</p>
<p>While it doesn’t cover everything, OBD-II has grown to include data on most of your engine’s vital systems. It monitors electronic controls and sensors, and will trigger the “check engine light” (technicians call it the “malfunction indicator lamp” or MIL) if there’s a serious problem.</p>

There’s a 16-pin connector in your car, always located somewhere near your steering wheel, that lets an OBD-II scanner connect to the onboard system. In addition to the emissions-test readiness report and details on what code triggered a warning light, some scanners can also listen in on the data being sent from the sensors to give live readings or a graph of those values over time.</p>
<p>Our expert, Scott McLain, emphasizes the tricky balance a scan tool represents for a DIY-er. “It comes back to knowing what’s good data and what’s bad data; you can see what happens [looking at graphs of conditions in a malfunctioning car], but you’ve got to know what the data means.”</p>
<p>Scott warns that there’s also a false sense of economy that can come with owning a scan tool. “People come to me sometimes and say ‘this code means this is the problem, here’s a part I bought, put this in for me.’ Sometimes it’s that simple, but weird stuff happens on cars. Rust damage… rodent damage… a lot of people don’t want to pay to do real diagnostic work, but there might be nothing wrong with that part. Instead, there might be a computer error because of a broken ground wire in the trunk.”</p>
<p>A scanner can definitely point you in the right direction, though. Scott acknowledges the value of an OBD scan tool for someone who wants to find out more about what’s going on inside their car: “A check engine light on your car is like your car is running a fever; it’s a symptom. A mechanic needs to find out what’s behind that. With a graph, you can actually see what the computer sees; sometimes you can watch the voltage sweep on a control signal and see if there’s a glitch.”</p>
<p>After you successfully diagnose and correct a problem on your car, the OBD-II scanner’s most essential function for a do-it-yourself mechanic is to reset the system by clearing the trouble codes.</p>
<p>Most scanners can also access the “freeze-frame” data that’s recorded when a code is first set, so you can replicate the conditions from the initial fault (speed, engine temperature, etc.) and make sure the problem doesn’t come back under some certain conditions that you didn’t see when you were working on it.</p>

<p>If you’re working on a project car or if you want to avoid trips to the dealer at all costs, you may want a way to read codes for other systems that aren’t covered by the OBD standard.</p>
<p>Other systems include anti-lock braking, airbag and tire pressure monitoring. These systems almost always use the same network for communication as OBD, but with different protocols and proprietary codes that won’t show up on a generic scanner. If you buy a scanner designed to read, for example, Ford’s brake-system diagnostics, then you’ll have an extra menu option that shows you those codes.</p>
<p>Three of the scanners we tested included some extended diagnostic access. BlueDriver comes with an impressive compatibility list, while the OBD Fusion app only has modules for some Ford, Mazda and Toyota/Lexus vehicles and requires in-app purchases for each model year you want to scan. The Innova 3030g2 lists ABS support for some models, but in our tests it didn’t read one of the popular cars it was supposed to support.</p>
<p>Compatibility is the trickiest part of picking a tool for extended diagnostics. Generally, shop tools your mechanic buys are expensive because they guarantee compatibility. A repair shop will probably have tools like a Snap-On Verus or OTC Genisys, and those manufacturers make their money on specific compatibility modules and updates for new cars every year.</p>
<p>PC software is typically the cheapest way to get access to all the hidden programming the manufacturer codes in the various networks and controllers. The realm of brand-specific control and diagnostic software is a scary place, though, full of eBay-sourced USB cables and (often) pirated software. There’s some good software and quality equipment out there for many brands of cars, but be careful, and don’t expect miracles to be cheap.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-scanners">Types of scanners</h2>
<h3>Stand-alone scanners</h3>
<p>This is the most common type of tool used for OBD code-reading, a handheld computer that reads your car’s diagnostic data and gets power through the car’s data port.</p>
<p>This is the type of reader you’ve probably seen at a parts store, and we tested models that cost less than $70. Screen sizes, button layouts and features vary.</p>
<h3>Smartphone connected scanners</h3>
<p>This is a fairly new type of OBD scanner, but they’re becoming very popular. Most Wi-Fi or Bluetooth scanners are based on an integrated circuit made by Elm Electronics, called the ELM327. The adapter itself is just an interpreter between your car and your smartphone; the display, logging and resetting of diagnostic data is handled by an app.</p>
<p>That said, not all adapters are created equal.</p>
<p>On the bargain side of things, there are cheap adapters all over Amazon, eBay and pretty much everywhere else you can find cheap electronics. These are mostly Bluetooth adapters that only work with Android and Windows platforms, though there are USB and WiFi-connected adapters as well.</p>
<p>Cheap adapters are almost all based on the ELM327 design, but Elm charges $15 just for the chip in bulk, so it shouldn’t be surprising if a $9 buy-it-now-bargain doesn’t use a genuine chip.</p>
<p>Specialized designs from companies like Carista, PLX Devices and OBDLink are designing circuits around new, 100% legitimate versions of Elm’s chip, which means lower power draw and a larger buffer for data transmission, along with a few new commands. These adapters are more likely to use the new Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth 4.0 standards, which also brings iPhone compatibility. (Older iPhone adapters needed to set up a Wi-Fi network, which means you can’t use your OBD adapter and a Wi-Fi internet connection at the same time.)</p>
<p>Other manufacturers, like Lemur, Bosch and OBDEleven use their own proprietary chip (so they don’t work with universal apps like OBD Fusion or Carista) that reads extra codes like the airbag systems, ABS, central locking and security controls, and whatever else these wizards can coax out of your car’s systems. These adapters are generally also keys to unlock their respective apps, making the app a free download and the adapter more expensive.</p>
<p>Compatibility and feature sets run a huge gamut in the smartphone world. Some apps, like <a href="http://www.forscan.org/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FORScan</a> (Android only) and <a href="https://caristaapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carista</a>, will give you an immense amount of power over certain cars with a good universal adapter. Others, like <a href="https://www.automatic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automatic</a> or <a href="https://www.verizonwireless.com/connected-devices/hum-by-verizon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verizon’s Hum</a>, focus more on value-added features like Onstar-style roadside assistance services. Still others, like<a href="https://obdeleven.com/content/7-app-and-features" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> OBDEleven</a>, will give you a very specific set of features for one brand of cars and require both a proprietary adapter and software purchases to unlock features.</p>
<p>Fortunately, nearly any adapter/app combination will give you access to emissions readiness and engine diagnostics codes, just like a good stand-alone scanner.</p>
<h2>The scanner gave me a code, now what?</h2>
<p>If you decide to go with a scanner that only gives you the name of a trouble code (let’s say you get code P0100) and doesn’t offer any built-in interpretation, you’re still on your way to finding a fix. You can plug the code into a web database like OBD-codes.com or Repairpal.com and find out that there’s a problem with a mass airflow sensor.</p>
<p>For this example code, Repairpal.com has a good amount of information, and might even tell you more than a high-end diagnostic tool. OBD-codes.com also includes pictures and a more thorough description of the part, though the diagnostic steps are more terse. DTCsearch.com gave us much less general information about the MAF system, but it does describe the exact conditions that would trigger a code among a few different makes.</p>

<p>If you’re a wrench monkey who enjoys pulling covers off to see what’s happening, these sites are more tools in your toolbox that can help you diagnose how severe the problem is and can help you decide what to do next.</p>
<p>It never hurts to have a service manual on hand for a vehicle that you want to work on yourself. If you’re okay with reading pages on a tablet or laptop you should check to see if your local library has access to Chilton or Haynes online manuals, it’s not uncommon to get free access with your library card.</p>
<p>More expensive scanners, like the BlueDriver or Innova’s 3030g2, include access to a repair database. Innova will make you pay per-vehicle for access to repair guides through their RepairSolutions PC application and website, while BlueDriver gives you in-app access to the Identifix database through their app. We haven’t done a direct comparison of all these manuals, but Identifix sells their Direct Hit subscription service for $179 monthly, so the fact that BlueDriver includes access for an unlimited number of cars in the $99 adapter purchase makes it a value leader.</p>

<p>These are the top features that we checked for and tested on each scanner:</p>
<p><strong>Freeze frame data:</strong> This is a special memory area in your car’s diagnostic system that will record the precise conditions of the car when a fault code triggers the check engine light. All but the most basic readers (like the Autel &#8211; MaxiScan MS300) should be able to show you this data.</p>
<p><strong>Live data:</strong> This function will let you see engine performance information, either as a real-time update of numbers or as a graph. We gave half-points in this category for numerical readouts, and a full point for a graphed plot of the data.</p>
<p><strong>Save data:</strong> This an option that lets you record and play back a readout or graph. This is useful if you have an intermittent problem that doesn’t generate a code. The option to save data also comes with ways to print, download, or otherwise share the data your scanner finds. On a smartphone diagnostic app, this feature is almost always available with a GPS overlay, so you can see what’s happening at specific locations in a test drive.</p>
<p><strong>Mode 6:</strong> Often labelled mode $06 or “Onboard Monitor,&#8221; this is one of the ten modes programmed into your car’s diagnostic system. Mode 6 functions are related to live data readouts, but these are the specific internal tests that your car is doing to decide whether things are okay or if it should notify you via the check engine light. This system wasn’t originally designed to be readable by humans, but some scanners include a translated readout of the hexidecimal-coded values. It’s a popular way to find out if the engine has any misfire or compression problems on a particular cylinder, or other data that might indicate a problem but isn’t severe enough to trigger a check engine light.</p>
<p><strong>Evap test: </strong>This is a specific mode $08 command that tells your car to start a test of the “evaporative emission control system” (mechanics call it “evap” for short) that prevents fuel from evaporating out of your tank and contributing to smog. Triggering this test won’t fix anything by itself, but once you do fix a problem with the fuel system it’s nice to be able to manually trigger a test. This way you can verify your fix right away, without waiting a few days (or longer) for your car to run it automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooter functions:</strong> These give you a set of recommended fixes for problems detected by the scanner. This feature is tricky to score, since the advice given is only valuable if the diagnosis is precise enough to pinpoint a specific problem. We gave the Innova scanner a half-point here, since it will only look up fixes in Innova’s database if you pay a subscription fee.</p>
<p><strong>Airbag codes:</strong>  These are only visible to a scanner that’s looking for them, and we were pleasantly surprised that BlueDriver was able to see and reset our test code without any issues. OBD Fusion was not able to see any airbag codes on our test vehicle, even with the $9.99 optional diagnostic module that’s available for matching model-year Toyotas. We gave it a half-point because it might be able to read codes for your car.</p>
<p><strong>ABS codes:</strong> These are also proprietary and sometimes tricky to read. Innova’s 3030g2 is supposed to read ABS codes for Domestic and Toyota vehicles, and OBD Fusion has an in-app purchase for 2007 Toyotas, but neither tool was actually compatible with our test car. We only gave those scanners half a point. BlueDriver, once again, was the only scanner to see the test code.</p>
<p><strong>Firmware updates:</strong> These aren’t required for a general-purpose scanner, since the OBD-II system is a written-in-stone specification and any scanner should be able to read the check engine light of any car that’s compliant. Still, it’s nice to know that a manufacturer can fix bugs. The possibility of support for a new feature that comes along in a few years is also encouraging, though it’s not likely you’ll see any major revisions on a sub-$100 tool.</p>
<h3>Smartphone extras</h3>
<p>There are some tricks and hacks available through a newer car’s electronic control systems that might be accessible with the right combinations of adapter hardware and software.</p>
<p>For example, take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frYnlrCdea0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volkswagen “hatch pop mod.”</a> With parts from an enthusiast parts supplier like ECS tuning and the Carista or OBDeleven app, you can add a hatch open remote to a VW Golf that didn’t come with that feature from the factory.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this kind of non-diagnostic programming is only going to be available with a software package running on a smartphone or computer connected by a USB or Bluetooth adapter. Software exists for nearly every modern vehicle type (since the dealership has to program your vehicle when they set it up or it work on it) but the cost and complexity of that software package varies.</p>
<p>Going back to our Volkswagen example, Rosstech LLC sells the famous VCDS software and USB interfaces that unlock all kinds of programming control, but at a $199 starting price, it’s definitely not an impulse buy. Carista represents a new generation of enthusiast modification software, using a modern smartphone interface and low-cost Bluetooth adapter hardware.</p>
<p>We tested the Carista app on a recent-model Toyota minivan, and found that it gives an interesting array of programming options for things like lights, key remotes and climate control. Carista didn’t do anything beyond basic OBD-II reporting on our primary test car, a 2007 Corolla. Other than the Carista-branded Bluetooth adapter, only the Android-only BAFX adapter worked with the Carista app.</p>
<p>From online comments, it looks like Carista is blocking compatibility with adapters like those from Veepeak because of possible problems with a non-genuine ELM327 interface chip; the fact that the less expensive BAFX adapter is not blocked makes the situation a bit baffling. The Carista-branded adapter is the only one we tested, then, that offers both iPhone compatibility and the extended Carista “mod” functions. The other adapters work very well for OBD-II diagnostic work in apps like OBD Fusion.</p>

<p>Working with expert diagnostic technicians, we built a battery of tests that cover functions of diagnostic scanners.</p>
<p>First, we unplugged a set of sensors on our test car to trigger error codes and test the ability of these scanners to read and reset codes.</p>
<p>Don’t try this at home unless you’re confident you know what you’re unplugging and what it might break<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Unplugging the oxygen emissions sensor tripped a P0031 emissions system code, which triggers a check engine light. This is the kind of code that you can read and reset with any functional OBD-II scanner,</p>
<p>Unplugging an airbag-related seat occupancy sensor triggered the airbag warning light on the dash and generated a B1650 “body code”. This is a special code that’s not included in the ODB system, and is only read and reset by scanners with manufacturer-specific programming.</p>
<p>We also unplugged a brake system fuse under the dash to trigger a P0504 code for the anti-lock-braking system. Again, this falls outside of generic compatibility and requires a specialized tool to spot.</p>
<p>We ran the car for a few minutes with all these sensors unplugged, then turned off the engine. We scanned for codes with the engine off and the key in the on position, as most guidelines suggest for diagnostic scanning of stored codes.</p>
<h3>Interface</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10884" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface-score-chart-8.png" alt="scanner interface comparison" width="901" height="773" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface-score-chart-8.png 901w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface-score-chart-8-610x523.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface-score-chart-8-768x659.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface-score-chart-8-295x253.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface-score-chart-8-885x759.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface-score-chart-8-360x309.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface-score-chart-8-375x322.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface-score-chart-8-414x355.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/interface-score-chart-8-320x275.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /><br />
Beyond using the scanners to look up a controlled malfunction code, we explored other functions of the scanners by running live readouts (where available available) and exploring the other menu functions.</p>
<p>We took points away for scanners that are hard to use or confusing, and added points when we found the menu options and buttons intuitive. Hotkeys for frequently-used functions are a nice feature that gave a few scanners a leg-up here.</p>
<p>Note that we scored the interface usability separately from the number of features available. For example, the Innova &#8211; 3030g2 scored fairly high since it tells you what it can with minimal menu-searching and makes it relatively easy to check and clear codes. The Autel &#8211; MS300 is also a simple scanner, but the dim one-line-at-a-time readout did not fill us with joy.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10885" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/report-speed-8.png" alt="scanner speed comparison" width="900" height="1087" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/report-speed-8.png 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/report-speed-8-610x737.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/report-speed-8-768x928.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/report-speed-8-885x1069.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/report-speed-8-295x356.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/report-speed-8-360x435.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/report-speed-8-375x453.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/report-speed-8-414x500.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/report-speed-8-320x386.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We recorded how quickly the scanner reported the trouble codes, timed from when we plugged in and turned the key until a code identification or definition was displayed.</p>
<p>For the universal Bluetooth and wifi adapters we used the OBDFusion app to test scanning time.</p>
<p>We also used Torque’s adapter information page to find the average update speed after one minute of connection time running a live graph.</p>

<p>Lemur Vehicle Monitors is a tiny company located on the tiny island of Newfoundland off the eastern shore of Canada, but their BlueDriver app and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluetooth adapter</a> is one of the biggest things that’s happened to automotive diagnostics in decades.</p>
<p>It’s not that BlueDriver is a revolutionary idea; plenty of other companies are selling Bluetooth adapters that work with a specific smartphone app. Some of those other solutions are even offering similar features. What’s big about BlueDriver is how simple and well-integrated it is.</p>
<p>Where other companies will sell a limited app with add-on modules that open up enhanced diagnostics, or a subscription-based app that means you’ll pay over and over again to keep using the hardware you’ve bought, BlueDriver is a one-time hardware purchase. You can install the app for free on as many devices as you want, and the adapter will unlock all the functionality, service bulletin and recall databases and vehicle-specific modes.</p>
<p>It’s a solid adapter, too. This system uses the new Bluetooth 4.0 protocols, so it’s compatible with both Android and Apple’s iOS devices so long as they’ll run Android 4,0 or iOS 7.0 or higher. (That’s pretty much every device made since 2012.)</p>
<p>The fact that this is a one-app adapter is a disappointment, since there are some other apps like Carista and Torque that have interesting features BlueDriver doesn’t cover, but the disappointment fades when you see that the app and adapter connect right away and work seamlessly with each other.</p>

There’s even a flashlight button!</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Lemur has good info on what data their app can and cannot see for a specific vehicle on <a href="https://www.bluedriver.com/questions#block-faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this compatibility list</a>. This is the kind of detail we like to see. Definitely check out your car on a compatibility list before you invest in a tool like this to see what you will or won’t get. We checked against a list of the <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/news/top-20-most-popular-used-cars-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top-selling cars in the U.S.</a>, and the only top-ten omission was Chevrolet airbag and tire-pressure compatibility.</p>
<p>This isn’t going to replace a $5,000 scan tool, but it might replace one that cost you $500. It doesn’t include a tablet, so if you don’t already own or want one then a tablet-style scanner from Autel or Launch might be a better purchase for serious diagnostic work. There’s a pretty good chance you do own a compatible device, though.</p>
<p>In use, the fact that this scanner found and reset every code we tried to generate on our 2007 Toyota Corolla was very impressive. Airbag codes are notoriously difficult to read and reset, and just unplugging the occupant sensor or seatbelt sensor cables on your front seats will trigger them. If you work on car stereos or upholstery, this is a killer app.</p>
<p>We were also impressed to see the way BlueDriver keeps a record of every car you connect it with and logs the date, time and any trouble codes it finds.</p>
<p>The one feature of the better stand-alone scanners that didn’t show up in BlueDriver is a trigger for the mode $08 evaporative system test. This isn’t an essential feature, since it’s a test your car will do automatically after a certain amount of time (specific conditions to trigger the test vary), but it would make this a more valuable tool for someone fixing a problem right before taking a car in for emissions testing.</p>
<p>That said, the most impressive feature of this system is the updates that Lemur has rolled out. They’ve added more and more vehicles to the extended diagnostics compatibility list, and if some breakthrough new feature or mode comes along it’s quite possible that BlueDriver will be updated to support it.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Lemur &#8211; BlueDriver turns your smartphone into a top-notch scan tool with a long list of essential diagnostic features.</li>
<li>Extended diagnostic functions for many popular cars makes the price tag easier to swallow. Not every car is included, but for $99 it’s an impressive list.</li>
<li>The flashlight button on the main screen is brilliant.</li>
<li>There are a few feature we’d ask for, and compatibility with universal-adapter apps like Carista or Lap Timer would also be nice.</li>
</ul>

Of all the handheld scanners that don’t need a smartphone, the Launch &#8211; CReader V+ isn’t the most feature-complete we tested, and it’s also not the least expensive. When we asked our expert diagnostic tech which of the seven handheld scanners he’d take, though, he went for this one.</p>
<p>This scanner is built on the same hardware platform as some of Launch’s more expensive scanners, as well as the slightly-cheaper CReader 4001. There are a few upgrades that bring the price up $12 or so from the 4001 (which we also tested.)</p>
<p>The basic functions are all here: freeze frame data and code-reading with basic definitions, of course, but also a color graph that can display two parameters simultaneously.</p>
<p>The bonus features offered on the V+ that set it apart from the other scanners include:</p>
<ul>
<li>On-board monitoring readouts, including Mode 6 (Mode $01, $02, $06 and $08 data were visible for our test car)</li>
<li>O2 sensor test reports</li>
<li>A dedicated evap test system ($08) trigger command</li>
</ul>

It won’t run down your smartphone battery, either. </p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYTDKP3/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>These screens might be very helpful to some owners, and might never get activated by others. Scott McLain, the service technician who helped us test these scanners, noted that he’d always pay a few dollars more to get the evap test commands: it’s the kind of function that really comes in handy if you ever have to work on related parts.</p>
<p>We’ll note than the CReader V+ is listed on the LaunchTechUSA website as a USA-sold product, and you might get slightly more traction with their service department if you own a V+ rather than a grey-market 4001. The update available from LaunchTechUSA’s website applied to our V+ scanner without a hitch.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The CReader V+ packs all the features you can ask for into a fast, powerful budget-priced scanner.</li>
<li>You can save a bit of money with cheaper scanners if you don’t think you’ll ever do more than scan and reset codes, but graphing live data on the big color screen is well worth an upgrade.</li>
<li>There aren’t any extended features like ABS or airbag compatibility, but the universal functions included are all top-notch.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-other-finalists">The other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>Apps</h3>
<h3>OC Tech &#8211; OBD Fusion</h3>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/obd-fusion-obd2-vehicle-scan-tool-diagnostics/id650684932?" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OBD Fusion from OC Tech</a> is a really, really close competitor for BlueDriver. Available for iPhone and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">for Android</a>, this app is a bargain if you want OBD scan functionality on your phone or tablet.</p>
<p>The place that BlueDriver really breaks away from OBD Fusion is in compatibility and extended diagnostics. OBD Fusion has support for things like airbag and ABS codes on a few cars, but even if the cars you work on are supported, you need to purchase those modules for each model year you want to work on.</p>
<p>Our test car is included in the listed range, but when we checked in the app we were disappointed to learn that none of the extended features would work. Score one for BlueDriver.</p>
<p>OBD Fusion was one of the first OBD scan apps (once known as Touchscan, which is still the name of OC Tech’s Windows software) and is still one of the best. The real strength it has over BlueDriver is that it will work with almost any OBD-II adapter: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or even USB. There are some great adapter hardware companies making products based on the ELM327 circuit, and OBD Fusion supports basically all of them.</p>
<p>The “universal” compatibility is both a feature and a curse. Connecting to your adapter requires jumping through a few hoops, and if you buy a faulty adapter that has problems or spotty compatibility with the extended diagnostic options, it’s hard to know where to start looking for a fix.</p>
<p>OCTech recommends and sells OBDLink hardware, which will give you pretty much guaranteed compatibility (these adapters are modified to support extended diagnostics on SW CAN &amp; MS CAN systems from Ford and GM). The new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JFRFJG6/?tag=ybdobd-20">OBDLink MX+</a> even works with Apple’s iOS devices, unlike older versions. The downside to this route is that you&#8217;re not saving anything over the pay-once BlueDriver package once you start adding extended diagnostic upgrades to OBD Fusion.</p>
<p>The case where we’d recommend OBD Fusion and an adapter like the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YVHGTBM/?tag=ybdobd-20">Carista &#8211; Bluetooth adapter</a> over BlueDriver is if you want to use a Bluetooth adapter for other apps, like <a href="http://www.gps-laptimer.de/compatibility/ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry’s Lap Timer</a> for track-day telemetry or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YVHGTBM/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carista</a> for modifications and extended diagnostics on a car that’s supported by that app. A combination of all these adapters and apps will let you do things that BlueDriver can’t, but it can be a headache trying to figure out exactly what works and how.</p>
<h3>Torque Pro</h3>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.prowl.torque" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Torque Pro by Ian Hawkins</a> is another old standby in the world of car-diagnostic apps, this one for Android only.</p>
<p>If you want the very least expensive way to do scary things with your car’s diagnostic system, Torque lets you ask for display of custom Parameter IDs, which means you can set up a display of things like a gear position or transmission temperature or battery monitors for your Prius.</p>
<p>That flexibility is partly dependent on the fact that Torque isn’t just an app designed for people doing automotive diagnostics; it’s an app designed to give you access to everything that your Bluetooth OBD adapter can possibly do. There isn’t much novice-friendly information available, but there are programming wizards developing plugins for the app that can do crazy things with bi-directional control of your engine systems. (<a href="https://torque-bhp.com/wiki/Plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This is a list of some available plugins</a>, but it’s not complete.)</p>
<p>Torque’s built-in OBD scan function spotted the ABS code that even the Innova ABS scanner and OBD Fusion’s extended diagnostic module weren’t able to read, so it’s not software that’s easy to dismiss. The fact that the interface is programmed to give you control of everything rather than being designed by someone who knows what makes a good diagnostic scanner is hard to overlook, though, and if you don’t own an Android device there’s not much incentive to go buy one just so you can use this app.</p>

<p>For a universal smartphone adapter that checks <em>all</em> the boxes, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YVHGTBM/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Carista adapter</a> is basically your only choice. Designed to be an adapter that works flawlessly with <a href="https://caristaapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carista’s companion app</a> (which also supports many of the less-expensive ELM327-based adapters), this adapter opens up nearly universal compatibility.<br />
Unlike BlueDriver’s proprietary system, this adapter will connect with <a href="https://www.scantool.net/touchscan/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Touchscan</a> on a Windows PC or <a href="http://www.gps-laptimer.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry’s Lap Timer</a> on an iPhone, and it’s compatible with Carista’s modification and service tricks.<br />
On our test car, Carista wasn’t able to do anything but basic OBD diagnostic scans, so BlueDriver still has an edge for compatibility, but if Carista does include features for your car you might be able to do things (like reset oil-change reminder or calibrate climate control settings) that BlueDriver just can’t do. This adapter works very well with OBD Fusion, and that’s probably your best bet for adapter/app combinations if you don’t want to be lock in with BlueDriver.</p>
<h3>Veepeak &#8211; OBDcheck BLE</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10872" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/veepeak-obdcheck-ble.jpg" alt="Veepeak OBDcheck" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/veepeak-obdcheck-ble.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/veepeak-obdcheck-ble-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/veepeak-obdcheck-ble-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/veepeak-obdcheck-ble-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/veepeak-obdcheck-ble-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/veepeak-obdcheck-ble-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/veepeak-obdcheck-ble-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/veepeak-obdcheck-ble-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/veepeak-obdcheck-ble-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/veepeak-obdcheck-ble-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/veepeak-obdcheck-ble-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073XKQQQW/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OBDcheck BLE</a> is the latest and greatest from Veepeak, adding iPhone compatibility over Bluetooth by upgrading to a Bluetooth Low Energy transmitter.</p>
<p>Despite to promise of expanded compatibility, this adapter is actually pretty disappointing, since Carista refuses to work with it. We tried a number of permutations of pairing and power-up sequences, but Carista seems to be blocking this adapter.</p>
<p>This adapter works fine in OBD Fusion, and if running that or some other broadly-compatible app is your goal then this is an affordable adapter that works with iPhones. It’s not really cheap enough to make it the winner over the Carista adapter, though, when that app represents such a dramatic expansion of features.</p>
<h3>BAFX &#8211; 34t5</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10863" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bluetooth-solo07-BAFX-B.jpg" alt="BAFX-bluetooth" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bluetooth-solo07-BAFX-B.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bluetooth-solo07-BAFX-B-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bluetooth-solo07-BAFX-B-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bluetooth-solo07-BAFX-B-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bluetooth-solo07-BAFX-B-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bluetooth-solo07-BAFX-B-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bluetooth-solo07-BAFX-B-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bluetooth-solo07-BAFX-B-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bluetooth-solo07-BAFX-B-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bluetooth-solo07-BAFX-B-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bluetooth-solo07-BAFX-B-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005NLQAHS/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BAFX &#8211; 34t5</a> is one of the most popular adapters you can find, and while we were initially skeptical about its quality it turned out to be the second-most compatible.</p>
<p>BAFX uses Bluetooth 3.0 protocols, so it’s only going to be useful with Android or Windows software. It worked flawlessly with Carista running on a Samsung Galaxy S5, though, and it was the fastest hardware to return a diagnostic report in our tests.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WPW6BAE/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veepeak &#8211; VP01</a> is one of the older smartphone adapters, from before Bluetooth 4.0 protocols opened up the world of easier iOS compatibility. The Wi-Fi transmitter means it works with nearly any software platform you can imagine, even older laptops without Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Sadly, Wi-Fi transmission of OBD diagnostic data means that this adapter will kill your internet connection while you’re scanning your car, since your phone assumes you’ll get internet over Wi-Fi. (There are workarounds to use cell tower data and Wi-Fi at the same time, but it’s not simple.) That’s not the end of the world for diagnostic work, but if you were thinking about using this adapter to set up a virtual dashboard to monitor everyday engine performance, it basically kills any streaming music or navigation functions.</p>
<p>This adapter also seems to be blacklisted by the Carista app, and it’s by far the slowest hardware we tested.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UJV3E12/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Foxwell &#8211; NT301</a> only offers graphing one data value compared to Launch’s two, but there are a few features that might get you to consider spending the $25 extra it’ll cost.</p>
<p>For one, the NT301 allows recording and printout of the live data it reads. There are three recording slots, and recording can be triggered manually or set to automatically start when a diagnostic code shows up in the OBD system. Some mechanics will prefer more graph options over recording, but there are situations where it would be nice to have a scanner watching for values when you’re busy with some other part of your troubleshooting.</p>
<p>The NT301 also scores points for an easy-to-navigate interface, with a few more buttons that don’t ever leave you wondering which one to press. An I/M (smog check) readiness hotkey is a nice touch.</p>
<p>Foxwell lost some points, though, for speed. This scanner took 25% longer to complete a scan than our top pick, and it’s also one of the most expensive scanners we tested.</p>
<p>Still, if you want to print a graph, trigger evap tests, and keep your scanner separate from your smartphone, Foxwell’s NT301 does come in at $30 less than BlueDriver.</p>
<p>We upgraded this scanner to version 2.22 using the <a href="http://www.foxwell.com.au/nt301-software-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NTWonder</a> Windows-only software from Foxwell’s website. This software also allows you to print out freeze frame data or any values you’ve recorded.</p>
<h3>Launch &#8211; CReader 4001</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-10869 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/launch-creader-4001.jpg" alt="Launch - creader 4001" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/launch-creader-4001.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/launch-creader-4001-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/launch-creader-4001-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/launch-creader-4001-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/launch-creader-4001-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/launch-creader-4001-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/launch-creader-4001-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/launch-creader-4001-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/launch-creader-4001-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/launch-creader-4001-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/launch-creader-4001-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WP4KY24/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CReader 4001</a> seems to fit in a bit of a grey area in the Launch product lineup. It’s not a model officially sold in the US by LaunchTech USA (the only authorized distributor if you’re buying something you want US warranty coverage for) and it isn’t on <a href="http://www.crecorder.com/website/index.do?method=welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRecorder.com</a> either. That means no updates, even though there’s a USB port on the bottom of the scanner.</p>
<p>This isn’t a big disappointment, though, since the 4001 doesn’t offer much in the way of specialized functionality. Software upgrades are always nice if they’re offered, but for OBD-II code reading an update is unlikely to change anything. At worst, you might miss out on new definitions for codes that get added as the system evolves, and you could always look those up online.<br />
We wondered if the V+ might be faster or show more detailed graphing information than the 4001, but it really does appear to be exactly the same hardware with a few more features enabled or disabled by the software they run.</p>
<p>The fact that this is the second-cheapest scanner we tested makes it an easy value recommendation, but the V+ is probably worth another $12 for many shadetree mechanics.</p>
<h3>Innova &#8211; 3030 g2</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-10868 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2.jpg" alt="Innova - 3030g2" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/innova-3030-g2-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Innova’s software suite that connects to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009JCU1ZO/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3030g2</a> (often just listed as “3030g”) has probably the most sophisticated workflow we tested. Sadly, that also means it’s the most tied to an internet connection and a Windows computer (sorry Mac users.)</p>
<p>Innova’s PC software is called <a href="https://www.repairsolutions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RepairSolutions</a>, and after you’re finished running the code checks with the handheld scanner, that’s where almost all the magic happens. This is a web service, so you’ll need a PC with internet access to do anything more than a basic code check.</p>
<p>Once you’ve created a RepairSolutions account and installed the drivers for your scanner, Innova allows you to do some basic paperwork: you can view and print reports for vehicles you’ve scanned and access technical service bulletins or recalls for those vehicles. This also lets you log miles between check-ups if you’re buying a scanner for vehicles you take care of, and it gives some “preventative maintenance” recommendations based on the age of the vehicle.</p>
<p>An upgraded subscription account ($9.99 per vehicle, or $39.99 for five cars) gives you access to recommended diagnostic and repair instructions from Innova’s database. (Pro accounts even let you print itemized repair costs.) This is less than the cost of a subscription on ChiltonDIY.com or buying a hard copy of a manual, and having repairs matched to specific codes is a real plus. It’s still going to cost more than using a library subscription to a Haynes or Chilton database and using RepairPal.com to look up codes and fixes, though.</p>
<p>The fact that Innova ties the diagnostics to VIN instead of car type also means that you can’t double-up your investment the way you can when buying a service manual and sharing with a friend who owns the same car.</p>
<p>The real killing blow for our opinion of the 3030g2 was that it failed to even scan for the ABS code in our test. ABS features command a price premium, generally only showing up in $150+ tools, and our car was listed as compatible on the <a href="https://www.innova.com/en-US/Product/Detail/3030g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Innova compatibility checker</a>. If you get lucky and this tool can scan an ABS code for you, its value goes up, but without a live readout, the diagnostic utility is still less than it should be at this price.</p>
<p>The 3030g2 makes sense as a purchase for a maintenance completionist who likes to have stand-alone tools that create neat, organized reports. Paying extra for repair walkthroughs doesn’t make this a great value, but it does make it more like an entry-level shop computer than just a diagnostic reader.</p>
<h3>Autel &#8211; AutoLink AL319</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007XE8C74/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Autel &#8211; AL319</a> is a simple scanner that presents basic OBD-II information without any other fluff. There are only two real interface buttons (scroll and enter) and a hotkey that will take you directly to an emissions pre-test report. If you just want to test cars for problems before you go to a “smog shop,” this scanner will give you the goods.<br />
The fact that you can read freeze frame and live data will help if you ever need to do any real troubleshooting, but this is definitely not a feature-rich solution like the graphing scanners from Launch.</p>
<p>Autel offers updates for the AL319 as separate download packages that require use of their MaxiLink II Toolkit PC software. This installer needs to be run from an administrator account, but the download was relatively easy to find.</p>
<p>The availability of updates means that this scanner has a thorough list of diagnostic trouble codes and you won’t be as reliant on looking those up somewhere else, but in the age of smartphones and RepairPal.com that’s not as important as it once was.</p>
<h3>Ancel &#8211; AD310</h3>

<p>The interface for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ancel &#8211; AD310</a> is not the worst we used, but the monochrome LCD definitely reminds you that you’re working with a 1990s-era tool. The fact that the “back” button is on the right-hand side of the arrow keys is also something that annoyed us on a few occasions.</p>
<p>This was the only scanner featuring a USB port that doesn’t come with a Mini-USB-B to USB-A cable in the box. Fortunately we have plenty on hand from the other scanners.</p>
<p>Ancel was also the one of the few manufacturers that requires a registration — verified by email — in order to download an update. The form on their site gave an error when we tried to register (and we haven’t heard back from their email support staff), so we tested with the software version that shipped on the scanner.</p>
<p>The fact that the Ancel has up and down arrow keys almost gives it an edge over the nearest-rival Autel &#8211; AL319, and it’s 14 seconds faster than our top pick to run a scan, but on the whole we’d rather have the easy-reading color screen and an update tool we can actually use.

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001LHVOVK/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MaxiScan MS300</a> is, in a word, spartan. The only things this scanner can do are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell you what code triggered a check engine light</li>
<li>Reset the check engine light</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t know what a P0440 code is, you’ll have to look it up yourself; there’s a booklet and a CD included with code definitions just in case you’re stuck in 2004 and can’t use Google to check any codes you find.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you own a car long enough, you’ll see a check engine light. There are people, probably most people, who when faced with that inevitable scenario should immediately call a mechanic. (Hopefully one you already trust; if not, there’s Yelp.)</p>
<p>Then there are the other people. The other people want to know. The other people want to be sure that the problem really is something that only a professional can handle, and these people (admire or pity them, they won’t mind) need an OBD-II scanner.</p>
<p>If you’re in this second group and you love the way your smartphone connects you to more information than you ever imagined, then the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BlueDriver app and Bluetooth adapter</a> from Lemur Vehicle Monitors is definitely the scanner you should check out. The <a href="https://www.bluedriver.com/questions#block-faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">compatibility list</a> for extended diagnostics (ABS, airbag codes, tire pressure monitors…) doesn’t include every car, but it probably includes yours.</p>
<p>For that even smaller set of people who do their own fixing but also sneer at smartphones, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYTDKP3/?tag=ybdobd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CReader V+ from Launch</a> doesn’t depend on Bluetooth or cell phone batteries. This scanner gives you access to basically every feature that falls under the universal OBD-II standard, so if there’s a check engine light you’re more than covered.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter 20 hours of installing and testing three different types of garage door openers, hundreds of open/close cycles and consulting with expert installers to learn what issues cause long-term problems, we chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758L67KP?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chamberlain &#8211; B500 Series</a> as the best garage door opener for residential use. Chamberlain’s B550 is an ideal model for most do-it-yourself types, with a worry-free belt drive and all the features you’ll need right out of the box. For a German-engineered opener — and a higher price tag — look to our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMVRMY8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sommer &#8211; Direct Drive 1042V001</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We know plenty of anecdotal stories about openers in our own homes and in the garages of our friends and relatives, but we spent a long week digging on internet communities like /r/homeowners/ and the <a href="https://www.garagejournal.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garage Journal</a> forum to see what other people have to say about the openers they install and use.</p>
<p>We talked to our contractor friends at <a href="https://www.buildzoom.com/contractor/k-t-younger-construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KTY Construction,</a> garage door installers at <a href="http://crownsgd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crown Door</a>, and three different contractors who work with <a href="http://thegaragedoorhero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Garage Door Hero</a>.</p>
<p>After checking a few facts, we found out that Chamberlain Group, Inc. now makes the majority of openers in the US. This includes well-known brands like Liftmaster and Sears’ private label Craftsman.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Chamberlain has a good reputation among installers and homeowners. Sadly, the same cannot be said for the only major competitor, Genie. The general consensus is that durability and quality of materials used in Genie’s residential-class openers have degraded significantly in recent years, and it was hard to find an expert who didn’t warn us about that when we asked about the brand.</p>
<p>We decided not to test a Genie opener, since they’re very similar to Chamberlain models except in the reputation for build quality, and they’re not competitive in pricing.</p>
<p>To see how the other brands stand up to the market leader, we chose a newcomer to the market; Skylink has <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/11/review-skylink-atoms-garage-door-opener/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made a name for themselves</a> selling their compact “Atoms” openers with tight integration into the Skylink <a href="https://geekdad.com/2016/12/atoms-garage-door-opener/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIY security/smart-home system</a>.</p>
<p>We also tested a Sommer direct-drive model, since it represents probably the only significantly different option you’ll have in the world of residential garage door openers. Sommer has very positive buzz in homeowner discussions and a lifetime warranty is always a good sign, even if it does come at a price premium.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-even-diy">Can you install an opener yourself?</h2>
<p>After working with three different types of opener systems and talking to three installers, we’d say there are a few essentials you need if you want to DIY:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Construction know-how.</strong> If you can’t climb up on a ladder and add a brace between studs to mount the bracket above the door header, then hire someone to do this job for you.</li>
<li><strong>Supplies and tools.</strong> Chamberlain’s kit doesn’t even include the lag bolts or angle iron you’ll need to hang the motor end, so a basic familiarity with construction fasteners and where to get them is essential. Beyond a ladder, you should have a measuring tape, wrench set and a good screwdriver. A stapler and a drill or impact driver are also must-have for running wire and driving lag screws.</li>
<li><strong>A helping hand.</strong> It’s possible to lift and install an opener motor yourself (the Sommer Direct-Drive is easiest in that case), but it isn’t fun. At the very least you’ll probably need a big cardboard box or a stool to raise the back of the rail so you can clear your door springs when you hang the front end.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got a free afternoon, tools and supplies, then installing a garage door opener isn’t especially difficult. If you’re replacing an existing opener, it shouldn’t take more than four hours.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-hire">Hiring a professional installer</h2>

<p>If you search on Yelp or talk to general contractors and property managers, it’s pretty easy to find garage door installers with good reputations. These are the guys installing, repairing and maintaining residential and commercial doors all around you, so they know how to keep your door rolling.</p>
<p>Retailers like Home Depot and Amazon also have “professional installation” services they sell, but from what we can see, they&#8217;re not much different from calling up a pro from Yelp. There’s a lower chance of getting stuck without service or warranty recourse if you go through a bigger company, but you can save some money if you cut out the middle-man.</p>
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>An installer can do the job quickly and efficiently and will have all the materials ready to get the job done.</li>
<li>If you’re buying the opener hardware from your installer, there’s usually a service warranty included in case anything ever goes wrong.</li>
<li>The installer’s opener, if you buy it, typically has a long one-piece track that is said to be more reliable and durable than the bolt-together track that comes in retail packaging.</li>
<li>An installer will also be able to maintain and service your door, including adjustment of the track, joints and spring balance. All our experts said this is the #1 key to keeping your door running for a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>An installer will often try to sell you an opener, and in that case, you’ll probably have fewer choices than you would if shopping for your own.</li>
<li>An installer won’t do electrical work for you, so make sure you have a ceiling outlet tested and ready to go before you call.</li>
<li>If you want to install something exotic like a Sommer Direct-Drive or a Jackshaft opener, some installers will turn down the job or offer no warranty even on the installation labor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-install">How to install a garage door opener</h2>
<p>Installing an opener on a door that has never had a motor before will take a few extra steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Spring balance will probably be biased toward making your door open by itself once you unlock it. That’s nice for saving you work when opening by hand, but it means a motorized opener is fighting the spring every time it closes the door, and that’s extra wear on the motor over decades of opening and closing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KiZvXfMCmgs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It’s not really that complicated to tweak spring balance</a>, but if you’ve got any doubts about your ability to do this safely then it’s definitely worth paying a pro.</li>
<li>Make sure you have an electrical supply where you need it. For our test install, we had to swap a lamp base for a receptacle: we tried a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-Porcelain-Lamp-Holder-with-Pull-Chain-and-Outlet-R60-09726-00C/100357030" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lamp-holder-with-outlet solution</a> but found that the plug would fall out of these receptacles easily and we don’t recommend them. You might be able to fit a receptacle in your ceiling electrical box, but with a smaller ceiling box designed for lamp bases, you may need <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HEHCAU/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a specialized adapter</a>.</li>
<li>If you have a finished ceiling rather than exposed joists or rafters, then locating the studs is going to be a must for hanging the opener. The installer we worked with uses <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CU7MS4/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">perforated angle iron</a> for hanging the opener motor and attaching the front of the rail to the wall above the door, which made all adjustments easy.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you find your power and structural options, or if you’re replacing an existing opener, the step-by-step guides included with the openers are thorough and clear. Assemble the rail, assemble the drive system, hang the door end of the rail, hang the motor, attach the door bracket and wire in the safety and control switches.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Motor power and door weight</h3>
<p>A garage door can weigh quite a bit, but nearly all rolling-door systems are designed with a large, carefully-tensioned spring that will keep the door “balanced.” If your opener is disconnected and you pull the door halfway open, it should stay there and not move. If you’re installing a new opener or replacing an old one, checking the balance of your door is a good first step to making sure your opener will work well for a long time.</p>
<p>Because the spring carries the weight of your door, for the majority of residential door installations the common ½ HP motor is more than enough power. At the very top of the open position the door is often resting on the track, though, and an especially heavy door (with wooden panels, for example) might benefit from a bigger ¾ or 1 HP motor.</p>
<h3>“Trolley” openers</h3>
<p>These all work in pretty much the same way, with your choice of a belt, chain or worm-gear shaft driving a trolley up and down a track that you install on your garage ceiling.</p>
<p>The majority of openers sold and installed are chain-drive, and typically that’s the only option on the most economical models at your hardware store. Belts are more common on models with all the bells and whistles, advertised as <a href="#how-we-tested">quieter than chains</a>. Worm-gear driveshafts are less common and require periodic greasing to keep them running quiet and smooth.</p>
<h3>Direct-Drive openers</h3>
<p>Sommer makes an opener system that mounts the motor directly to the trolley moving up and down the track, so the only moving part is the drive wheel itself. These are more expensive than the pulley-drive “trolley” openers, but they’re made in Germany and come with a lifetime warranty. This system is also one of the few that still uses a mechanical limit “stop” that tells the motor when to stop pushing, which will reassure the traditionalists who distrust the control circuits in other openers.</p>
<h3>Jackshaft openers</h3>
<p>If you have room (recommended clearance is almost a foot from the edge of your door to the wall), a “jackshaft” opener like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BS28SP8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Liftmaster &#8211; 8500</a> lifts your door directly from one side of the spring-balanced axle that makes your door easy to open and close. The advantage here is that you don’t need track and drive systems installed overhead, so setting it up should be much simpler and cleaner if you have space on the wall. (There are also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002P5RDDK/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">adapters</a> to get around clearance problems <a href="https://www.garagejournal.com/forum/showpost.php?p=3396232&amp;postcount=18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like two-door installations.</a>)</p>
<p>Do note that a jackshaft system requires extra tuning to keep the cable from unwinding and potentially causing the door to fall. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002P5PVXE/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pusher springs</a> are recommended to make sure your residential door will never get stuck at the top and cause a dangerous accident by free-falling.</p>
<h3>Battery backup</h3>
<p>Most garage door openers on the market are now available with a battery upgrade, and if the power in your area is especially unreliable it might be worth the cost.</p>
<p>We asked our installer contacts for opinions about batteries, and they noted that the biggest downside to batteries is that they will need replacing. Customer reviews online confirm that five to six years is a typical life for a backup unit, even if your power never goes out when you need to open the door.</p>
<p>If your garage door is the only way in and out of a building, make sure that you have some kind of mechanical emergency release system in place, even if you opt for a battery backup in case of power outages. A keyed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AOREGHQ/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“vault lock” emergency release</a> is quick to install and gives you a secure way to manually open the door from the outside even if your opener motor is malfunctioning.</p>
<h3>Remotes and keypads</h3>

<p>One of the only differences between manufacturer model numbers is the package of accessory remotes and panels included in the box you get.</p>
<p>It’s definitely cheaper to buy a package with all the components you want than to pick and choose redundant replacement parts, but you may have no choice if you want a compact single-button remote and an outdoor wireless keypad, for example.</p>
<p>Sommer was the only manufacturer that didn’t have a package with a code-entry keypad, and that’s definitely the feature that we missed most. If you don’t want to set up internet-enabled opening, a keypad on the outside of the door is a great backup just in case a family member locks you out of the house.</p>
<h3>Lighting options</h3>
<p>Other than the Atoms models, garage door openers all have sockets for standard a21-size lightbulbs. We tested models with two sockets, but some less expensive models will only take one.</p>
<p>Note that while incandescent bulbs are hot and inefficient and CFL bulbs are ugly, some LED bulbs can <a href="#how-we-tested">interfere with opener remotes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="wi-fi-garage">Smart hubs and compatibility issues</h2>
<p>Chamberlain Group (which includes Liftmaster and some other names) are integrating the “MyQ” smart garage system into their hardware, and it was included with the B550 opener we tested. All of the new opener motors from Chamberlain’s brands are compatible with the system, but if you don’t see a “Wi-Fi” logo on the motor housing, then you’ll need to add the “<a href="https://www.chamberlain.com/smartphone-control-products/smartphone-connectivity/myq-home-bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyQ home bridge</a>” to make it work.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10840" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor.jpg" alt="Nexx garage sensor installed" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nexx-garage-sensor-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Nexx Garage is an example of a third-party device that adds the same functionality. The hardware is a compact Wi-Fi-connected box that comes with one sensor so it knows when your door is open or closed. There’s also one set of wires to emulate a button push on your garage door opener’s wall panel and trigger the motor.</p>
<p>This is where the compatibility tricks come into play: Chamberlain’s MyQ openers don’t use a simple normally-open switch to trigger the motor, so Nexx Garage won’t work with Chamberlain hardware out of the box. <a href="http://nexxgarage.com/not-compatible-openers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexx Garage is currently offering a free bridge</a> that uses a wireless remote signal to trigger your MyQ opener, but it’s much easier to try working within Chamberlain’s walled garden if that’s the opener motor you want.</p>
<p>Nexx Garage is fairly easy to install: screw one side of the magnetic sensor to the wall above your door and screw the other side to the top of your door next to it. The included screws weren’t tough enough to get through the aluminum skin of our tester door, but a drill helped them out. There are also brackets included if you don’t have room at the top of your door, but the suggested mounting position worked well for us.</p>
<p>So long as you don’t have a Chamberlain opener, the button-push wires can go straight into your motor control connectors where your wall switch wires go. (There’s a small jumper wire included so you can test that this method works to trigger your opener, or you could test with a paperclip before you buy a Nexx Garage.)</p>
<p>The apps we tested, MyQ and NexxGarage, are nearly identical in functionality and setup. Even with a mediocre Wi-Fi signal out in the garage we quickly got both systems working and haven’t had any problems.</p>
<p>The app is great for checking on how often your door has opened during the week or opening/closing for a friend or a delivery guy without giving away your keycode. We linked NexxGarage to Google’s Assistant, but other than voice control there isn’t much it adds.</p>
<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/create" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IFTTT</a> recipes are the most powerful way to leverage a smart garage door. IFTTT can do things like open your door when you reach the driveway or turn off some security systems and turn on your smart lightbulbs when you get home and open the door.</p>
<p>Right now Chamberlain’s MyQ system supports IFTTT if you pay a (small) subscription fee; Nexx Garage includes it for free, though it’s “in beta testing.”</p>
<p>IFTTT opens up an insane number of “that’s cool, but why?” possibilities. The number of things that <i>could </i>trigger your door to open/close is overwhelming, but we can’t think of many that would be really useful. (The weather, maybe? An RSS feed publishing door statistics on your blog?)</p>
<p>If you’re the kind of person who worries at lunchtime whether you closed the door when you left for work in the morning, then this system might bring you peace of mind. Wi-Fi enabled opening and monitoring is a nice feature to have when it’s included (as in the Chamberlain systems), but we’re not sure it’s worth the extra purchase for the other openers we tested. If you buy a system like the Sommer without a keypad, buying an accessory keypad is probably a smarter first upgrade than the internet modules.</p>
<p>The one feature that we didn’t test, which seems <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YULBRWK/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">exclusive to Gogogate</a>, is integrated video along with door monitoring. Gogogate says they can integrate most IP security cameras into their garage door app directly, and that’s a cool feature if you’re already buying smart security cameras for your home or if you have a rural security gate that’s inside your Wi-Fi range.</p>
<h3>Long-term testing update</h3>
<p>In our long-term testing, we did use the Nexx Garage smart system to remotely open a garage door (from another country!) after both of the Sommer remotes had been left inside our detached garage. (The Sommer doesn&#8217;t come in a package with a code-access keypad like the others do.) Getting notifications on your phone that the door has been left open for longer than ten minutes was cool at first, but we turned it off after working all day in the garage one weekend.</p>
<p>The status on the Nexx Garage app is occasionally wrong when you first open the app, but it&#8217;s always correct when you refresh it. We haven&#8217;t had any Wi-Fi connectivity issues, but we did see a one-day <a href="https://myqcommunity.chamberlain.com/chamberlainmyq/topics/myq-outage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outage of the Chamberlain MyQ system</a> recently (they said in an email that they lost power to servers). So far, reliability has been good for both systems, but not good enough that we&#8217;d say you should replace your remotes and access panels with a smartphone app.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>We started with a blank slate: a single-car garage with a finished ceiling and a locking manual-open handle on a sectional roll-up door.</p>
<p>We worked with a pro installer from Garage Door Hero to set up the Chamberlain opener, and then our tester took it down and installed the other two systems himself.</p>
<p>Install difficulty is graded on two scales: ease of assembling and installing the hardware, and ease of understanding the instructions. Sommer’s system is remarkably easy to work with compared to the weight and complexity of the pulleys and fasteners of the other systems, but a critical step in the assembly of the drive unit <a href="https://www.sommer-usa.com/uploads/4/0/7/6/40760403/missing_fastening_bolt_sommer_direct_drive_openers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is missing from the version of the installation instructions included in our box</a>.</p>
<h3>Motor speed and noise</h3>
<p>We tested the speed of each motor and the amount of noise they made. Looking at the test results, it’s clear that the number of seconds you save going with the fastest model and the change in noise is not going to be significant to most people.</p>
<p>We tested the noise level when opening and closing the door using an LEQ-A scale with REW measurement software. We also tested the noise level when the motor was disconnected from the door and the level of noise made by the door being opened and closed by hand.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the door itself is by far the main source of noise, so if you want to get “whisper-quiet” operation you’re better off looking into door maintenance than a different drive system.</p>
<p>That said, the door definitely makes more noise when it’s moving quickly, so if quiet operation is your goal, the slow-and-steady Sommer wins by a nose.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We tested the door closing mechanism for resistance to intruders and for the safety features that prevent the door from closing on a person or object.</p>
<p>Each opener was secure against prying or lifting when closed, with no give or slack once the opener had been set to close the door completely during the final step of the installation process. If you notice a door that has a gap or any looseness when closed, you should be able to re-train the opener’s stop limit; check your owner’s manual.</p>
<p>Each opener system has a switch on the wall panel inside that allows you to “lock out” opener remotes or wall switches and prevent any remote entry.</p>
<h3>Safety sensors</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10838" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor.jpg" alt="safety sensor" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/safety-sensor-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>If you can’t get your safety sensors aligned, your garage door opener will not work. We actually had more trouble with the highly adjustable clips on the Chamberlain system than the bare-bones brackets that came with the Atoms opener, though once we got them aligned we didn’t have any issues with sunlight or any other interference preventing the door from closing.</p>
<p>Once the sensors were aligned we did both standard safety tests: the doors did not close if there was an object in the doorway blocking the light beam of the sensor, and the doors all auto-reversed when they hit an object.</p>
<h3>Remote range</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11837" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range.png" alt="opener range chart" width="2000" height="871" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range.png 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range-610x266.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range-768x334.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range-885x385.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range-1500x653.png 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range-295x128.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range-1000x436.png 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range-360x157.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range-375x163.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range-414x180.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range-320x139.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/garage-door-range-885x385@2x.png 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We took our opener remote down the block to see how far away you need to be to get the door to open.</p>
<p>Chamberlain was the only manufacturer who listed a range number in marketing materials, and we only managed to get 10 percent of the claimed range, even with the bulky three-button remotes included. We checked and the LED bulbs we were using are on <a href="https://www.liftmaster.com/catalogresourcesv3/en-us/shared/files/tucmanuals/led%20bulb%20compatibility_011714.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the recommended list</a>. It’s possible that our issues would be solved with new batteries, but the range with the remotes as they came out of the box was sufficient.</p>
<p>The Skylink and Sommer remotes are compact key-fob-sized models, which we appreciate (especially when using the garage remote on a motorcycle), but there are compromises to get the compact package:</p>
<p>Skylink’s opener never managed to pick up remote signals from farther away than 60 feet. That’s more than enough to sit in your car in front of the door and open or close it, but if you second guess a button press while driving up because you’re not sure you were close enough you can start yourself down a frustrating stop-start cycle that will definitely add unneeded stress to your life.</p>
<p>The Sommer antenna was definitely getting interference from the smart LED bulbs we tested; with the bulbs in, it would barely pick up a signal from twenty feet away after the light turned on. Without any bulbs installed the opener would work from approximately the same 70-foot radius as the Chamberlain opener.</p>
<p>Update: we tried <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sylvania-Value-Line-LED-Light-Bulb-A19-Soft-White-60-WE-E26-2-Ct/175179097" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">these Sylvania LED bulbs</a> in the Sommer, and the interference problem went away. If you can’t find those, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IHHVZTW/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genie advertises bulbs that should be compatible with “most systems”, but they’re <i>very</i> expensive</a>.</p>
<h3>Smart features</h3>
<p>We tested the MyQ system integrated into Chamberlain’s opener and the add-on Nexx Garage system by setting them up with smartphone control. Our Wi-Fi coverage in the garage was good enough for the test, and we never noticed connection problems with the openers even when a laptop wasn’t getting enough signal to stream music.</p>

<p>There are times when it feels like cheating to pick the market leader as the “best” product in a category, but for most people, there’s really no reason not to pick the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758L67KP?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chamberlain Belt Drive system</a>.</p>
<p>Chamberlain will sell you this garage door opener with any one of a dozen configurations, and that’s one of the reasons we like it. Whether you buy the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Chamberlain-1-2-HP-Chain-Drive-Garage-Door-Opener-HD210/206211732" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$110 Home Depot special</a> or the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Chamberlain-1-1-4-HP-Smartphone-Controlled-Ultra-Quiet-Strong-Belt-Drive-Garage-Door-Opener-w-Battery-Backup-MAX-Lifting-Power-B970/301951467" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$238 system with an upgraded motor, battery backup and LCD wall panel</a>, the opener should install and behave in predictable and consistent ways. It might be a bit of a pain trying to find exactly the combination of features you want (you can’t get the feature-encrusted wall panel without an upgraded motor and bulky three-button remotes, for example), but at least you know you’ll be able to find the parts separately.</p>
<p>If you don’t see the B550 for sale, the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Chamberlain-1-2-HP-Smartphone-Controlled-Heavy-Duty-Chain-Drive-Garage-Door-Opener-with-MED-Lifting-Power-C455/301951508" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">C455</a> has a nearly identical set of features but with chain-drive. We asked our installer, Jesus Rodriguez, which system he preferred, and he says that he hasn’t had any specific problems with any of the Chamberlain systems. “If you have a problem, it’s usually a problem from the start. Once an opener is set up right, we don’t really have problems with them.”</p>
<p>Installation for this system was fast and straightforward. Chamberlain does not include lag bolts or hanging brackets with their openers, so if you don’t have exposed overhead joists to hang the motor from (or if they’re in the wrong place) you’ll want to pick up some <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/s/lag%2520screw?NCNI-5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lag screws</a> and <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-1-4-in-x-48-in-Zinc-Plated-Punched-Angle-801337/204225757" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bracket material</a> at your local home improvement store.</p>
<p>Everything else about installing the Chamberlain is quick and by-the-book. We had a pro installer hang this model for us, and they finished in less than two hours (including time for remote programming and our incessant questions.)</p>

It has a great price considering its rock-solid Wi-Fi integration and top-class motor performance. Don't need the Wi-Fi bridge? Ditch the 550 for the 510 and save some cash.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758L67KP?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The day after installing there was a problem with the electronic safety “eye” alignment, probably due to the springs on the clip-on bracket settling overnight. After rocking them back and forth, the receiver LED glowed a steady green again, and everything worked without a hitch.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi-setup was quick; for more details on “smart” functions see our comparison with the Nexx Garage system above. Chamberlain has basically ensured that you can’t use third-party Wi-Fi adapters with their openers by changing the way wall switches send control signals, and that means you have to use Chamberlain’s MyQ app if you want smart features with this door opener. The downside there is that Chamberlain charges $10 per year to enable Google Assistant or IFTT compatibility, and that’s just <i>sad</i><b><i>.</i></b></p>
<p>We know that the people who want programming features like IFTTT compatibility are the same people who will refuse to buy products with pay-walls, so it’s a baffling decision. That said, it’s cheaper to buy a Chamberlain opener and subscribe to the IFTTT feature for a few years than it is to buy any competing “smart opener” systems.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Chamberlain is the market leader for a reason. The B550 Opener is solid and well-designed but still priced competitively.</li>
<li>Any installer or service technician will know exactly how to set up or troubleshoot this opener.</li>
<li>If you’re looking for info to do your own troubleshooting, Chamberlain has good documentation and most of the online discussions will be about a similar model.</li>
<li>This opener was the fastest we tested.</li>
<li>The remotes and keypad work flawlessly, even with cheap LED bulbs.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi “smart” app control works great with quick, easy setup.</li>
</ul>

<p>First, the bad news. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMVRMY8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sommer’s &#8211; Direct Drive 1042V001</a> is the most expensive opener we tested, and it has the fewest accessories or perks. The install manual isn’t as easy to navigate as the others, and there’s even <a href="https://www.sommer-usa.com/uploads/4/0/7/6/40760403/missing_fastening_bolt_sommer_direct_drive_openers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a part / design update that didn’t get included in the manual</a> shipping with those parts. This opener also had interference problems with a common LED lightbulb brand we tried.</p>
<p>With that out of the way: we really like this garage door opener, and if we had to re-install an opener every week this is the one we’d pick each time.</p>
<p>Many cantankerous old men talking about garage doors on the internet complain about the disappearance of mechanical limit switches, the part that tells your opener when to stop opening or closing the door. That’s fairly easy to program into the new-fangled electronic controllers, but it warms the cockles of our hearts to see that Sommer is still using a fail-safe mechanical system.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMVRMY8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sommer-direct-drive.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Runner-up: Sommer - Direct Drive</h3><p>This is a different way to open a garage door, and we love the ingenuity of the design. There’s a price premium and some quirks, but if you just want an opener that will last forever, then this is the one to get.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMVRMY8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>There are exposed moving parts and nylon gears on most garage door openers that need to stay tight, lubricated and precisely aligned in order to keep the system from wearing, chattering or jumping. (You also need to keep cats and birds from getting caught in the belt or chain.) Sommer keeps the moving parts to a bare minimum with one directly-driven metal sprocket that follows a precisely-tensioned metal chain hidden inside the rail.</p>
<p>The snap- or bolt-together rails of the other systems aren’t exactly awful designs, but the C-channel system Sommer uses is designed to stay in perfect alignment with the same tension that holds the chain up. If you have any doubts about tension in five or ten years, the system is easy to check and adjust.</p>
<p>Sommer managed to come out of our testing as the quietest opener, but that’s mostly because it’s the slowest. Unless you’re opening a brand-new door made with impossibly smooth joints on a perfectly-designed track, the door itself is going to be louder than any opener motor or drive mechanism, and the faster you open it the louder it will be.</p>
<p>While the other systems give you electronic eyes with brackets that snap onto a standard-size door roller track, Sommer makes no assumptions about your door and gives you brackets to screw into the wall. Aiming them was actually easier than it was for the Chamberlain system, and on our track, the clips took far more effort to snap on than we expected, so that’s another mark in Sommer’s favor.</p>
<p>This opener should work flawlessly with any third-party “smart” opener system like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J8JI9HY/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nexx Garage</a>, and you can buy it <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Direct-Drive-3-4-HP-Garage-Door-Opener-with-Smartphone-Controller-1042V002/206417603" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bundled with Gogogate</a> at the Home Depot. That’s yet another price premium compared to the all-included price of Chamberlain’s system, but at least they won’t charge you a subscription fee to turn on IFTTT.</p>
<p>The one comment in a customer review that worries us slightly is a note from a user who has seen carbon buildup on the metal electrical contacts on his system. The contacts should be self-cleaning, so it’s hard to say what went wrong in his case. Spraying the contact point with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006LVEU/?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deox-IT</a> every few years definitely wouldn’t hurt.</p>
<p>In the long run, the risks of something going wrong with a drive gear or belt on a conventional system are much higher, but it is something to watch for, and some people might be uncomfortable with a charged 24V DC rail overhead.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Sommer’s Direct-Drive one of the most expensive openers on the market, but the engineering quality might be worth the money in the long run.</li>
<li>A lifetime warranty means this is an opener you’d probably consider taking with you if you move, and it’s the easiest to disassemble and re-install.</li>
<li>No keypad or Wi-Fi accessories at this price, but they’re simple to add if you need those features.</li>
<li>Some surprise undocumented design updates and LED compatibility issues did make our install experience less than perfect.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M3OC32L?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skylink &#8211; Atoms AT 1612</a> is not a bad opener. It’s a compact and simple design compared to our top pick, but the design emphasizes meaningful features at the expense of not looking like the garage door opener you grew up with.</p>
<p>If the cable-car-style sliding trolley had been a little bit more overbuilt, or if the optional Wi-Fi module and “smart” wall control were included at this price, the Atoms opener could maybe unseat Chamberlain.</p>
<p>As it is, there are too many concerns about the long-term life of all the lightweight parts and not enough reassurances that Skylink is going to be around in twenty years to sell you new ones.</p>
<p>Skylink has carefully thought through the install package and included niceties like lock-washers, lag bolts and extra bracket material that Chamberlain simply refuses to provide. The clear, simple alphanumeric programming and troubleshooting codes are also superior to the ‘count-the-flashes’ system Chamberlain uses.</p>
<p>While we were unimpressed by the range of the remotes included, it’s sufficient and we like how compact they are. The keypad is as good as anything we’ve seen, and the safety “eye” transmitter/receiver clipped on (with some effort) and worked immediately without any aiming or tweaking headaches.</p>
<p>The fact that the lightbulb is built-in is also a refreshing change from the old bring-your-own philosophy of the incandescent era. It’s not the brightest LED setup we’ve seen, but it’s great that you don’t need to guess about compatibility.</p>
<p>If you’re looking at this opener as part of Skylink’s security system, they checked all the right boxes for this component and you won’t have any compatibility headaches. For anyone else, we’re still not sure it’s worth choosing over the opener everyone else is buying.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you have a garage door opener that’s died or if you’re installing a brand new one, it’s incredibly confusing trying to navigate the maze of features and specifications for the models available.</p>
<p>We went with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758L67KP?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chamberlain &#8211; B550</a> for a few reasons. It’s easy to find and purchase online, and every installer or repair guy in the US will be familiar with this design. The hardware is well-built and the system has proven dependable for millions of owners.</p>
<p>The price on the B550 is also right in the sweet spot: this has all the features available in Chamberlain’s ½ HP lineup without a battery backup, so it’s often priced lower than less-common ½ HP models that don’t have Wi-Fi modules.</p>
<p>If you don’t like the snap-together rails and nylon pulleys of residential openers and you don’t have room for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BS28SP8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jackshaft opener</a> beside your door, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMVRMY8?tag=ybdgdo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sommer’s Direct-Drive</a> system is worth a look. There are quirks and a price premium that kept this model from making top pick, but it’s a well-designed piece of hardware with a lifetime warranty.</p>
