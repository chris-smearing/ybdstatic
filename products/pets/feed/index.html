<p>You’ll be busy on the day that you pick up your dog, so you’ll want to prepare what you can in advance. Purchase the supplies that will help them feel welcomed and comfortable in your home.</p>
<p>If you can, get in contact with your chosen adoption shelter or breeder to see if your pet has any toys, food or sleeping arrangements that they’re already accustomed to. Keeping something consistent with your dog’s past will help them feel more comfortable in a new setting.</p>
<p>We’ve outlined some must-haves for dogs at different stages:</p>
<h3>Supplies for a new dog</h3>
<p>You’ll likely be starting from scratch when it comes to training if you’re welcoming a puppy into your home, so there are a few necessities that will help that introduction go smoothly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dog crate</strong>: A crate will help keep your puppy or dog safe when you can’t closely supervise them. It’s also a training tool, so it’s important to get a size that comfortably fits them. If you have a puppy and your crate is too large, they could use one end as a toilet, which could hold them back while potty training. If you have a dog breed that’s going to grow out of a crate fast, you can invest in a larger crate and use a divider while they’re a puppy.</li>
<li><strong>Bedding</strong>: Purchase a bed that’s large enough for your dog to stretch out on when they’re laying down. You’ll want it to be part of a comfortable space that they relax.</li>
<li><strong>Leash, collar, harness and identification tag</strong>: Using a collar versus a harness has been long debated, but in fact, both are effective supplies to have during the training process. Your collar should have a license, which is issued by the state, and an identification tag on it for safety reasons. Your harness is best for walks and training. Collars can cause a strain on the neck during walks, especially when your dog hasn’t been trained not to pull yet.</li>
<li><strong>Water and food bowls</strong>: Invest in a metal bowl as they have less risk of breaking and are easy to clean. You may also want to consider a non-slip base to avoid from the bowl moving out of place.</li>
<li><strong>Pet gate</strong>: Your dog will be curious of their new home, so if there is a room that you want to keep them away from, use a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-gates/">pet gate</a> to close off that area. Choose one that’s tall enough for your dog breed since some are known to scale gates.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise pen</strong>: If you don’t have an ideal room for your dog to play in, create a space that’s larger than their crate by using an exercise pen.</li>
<li><strong>Grooming tools</strong>: Be prepared for when your dog’s nails get long and when they start shedding by having nail clippers, a brush and a hair clipper on hand.</li>
<li><strong>Chew toys</strong>: Dogs love to chew, but puppies will want to chew through everything during the teething stage. Choose toys that aren’t too small to prevent choking.</li>
<li><strong>Dog food</strong>: While your dog adjusts to their new home, it’s recommended that you feed them the same food that they’re used to from the shelter or breeder. Once they’re ready, do your research and consult with your veterinarian to find the most suitable <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-dog-food/">dog food</a> option for your dog and slowly mix it in with the food that they’re accustomed to. Note that it may take a few tries until you find one that suits their health requirements and appetite.</li>
<li><strong>Dog treats</strong>: Be prepared with <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-dog-treats/">dog treats</a> to reward your dog during training.</li>
<li><strong>Dog waste bags</strong>: Have plenty of these on hand while on a walk to pick up after your dog.</li>

<p>Amidst the excitement of introducing a new canine friend to your family, it’s easy to forget to ensure a safe way to transport them. Before picking them up, set up your car so you can safely bring them home.</p>
<p>Transport your dog in a crate if you have enough space in your car. If you don’t have enough space, you can place them in the back and tie them to the headrest using a collar and leash. Ensure enough slack to allow repositioning, but not enough to fall off the seat. Give them a toy or a chew bone to keep them occupied for the ride.</p>
<blockquote class="ybd-featured-quote"><div class="ybd-featured-quote-inner"><p>My seat protector was the best investment I ever made. It&#8217;s amazing how much general dirt and gunk they track with them all the time.</p><footer class="ybd-featured-quote-footer"><cite>&mdash; Owner of a Dachshund</cite></footer></div></blockquote>
<p>They’ll likely be anxious when transported in a car with new people, so bring wetting pads, stain and odor removers and paper towels in the case of an accident.</p>

<p>Your home is new territory for your new pet, and their unfamiliarity can be shocking. This change can cause your pet to show abnormal behavior, so it’s important to give them a space that makes them feel comfortable.</p>
<p>It’s common to create this space in a crate since it helps with training and gives them a protected place to retreat to. Try to include as many familiar comforts as you can. Dogs respond strongly to smell, so include an old piece of clothing or a favorite dog toy from their former domain.</p>

<p>Before bringing your dog home, make sure that you create a safe environment for them. They’ll be curious of the new smells, sounds and nooks and crannies of your new place, so don’t underestimate their curiosity.</p>
<p>If your dog encounters a frightening event in your home, it will be difficult for them to feel comfortable in that space again, so you’ll want to avoid the possibility of an accident prior to their arrival.</p>
<p>Use our outline for dog-proofing every room in your home, and then download our checklist at the bottom to make sure that you don’t forget anything in the process.</p>
<h3>Bathroom</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Close the toilet</strong>: Like you see portrayed in the movies, dogs love drinking out of the toilet bowl. Unfortunately toilet bowls contain dangerous chemicals that could leave your pet sick.</li>
<li><strong>Use a medicine cabinet</strong>: Move your medicine, make up and other small toiletries to a cabinet to avoid from your dog getting into them.</li>
<li><strong>Install a tall rack in your shower</strong>: If you leave your bottles of shampoo and conditioner on the ground of your shower, your pet will have easy access to it. Put all of your in-shower toiletries up high to avoid from them being played with.</li>
<li><strong>Be aware of hot hair tools</strong>: If you use a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-curling-iron/">curling iron</a>, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-hair-dryer/">hair dryer</a>, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-hair-straightening-brush/">hair straightening brush</a>, or <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-flat-iron/">flat iron</a>, turn them off after using them, keep the cords on the counter while cooling and stow them away before you leave the bathroom.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bedroom</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep the door closed</strong>: This might seem obvious, but it can take time to become adjusted to closing your bedroom door if you didn’t have a dog before. Your bedroom is full of places for a dog to get into, so keeping the room off limits is the easiest way to avoid an accident.</li>
<li><strong>Keep garbage empty</strong>: If your dog does find a way to sneak into your bedroom, they’ll quickly find your small garbage can. Empty it often to avoid a mess.</li>
<li><strong>Hide small items</strong>: From makeup and jewelry, to shoes and decor, keep your small items out of reach from curious paws.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kitchen</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure drawers and cabinets</strong>: Avoid cutlery or other objects from being accessible by putting locks on all of your reachable drawers.</li>
<li><strong>Turn pot handles inward</strong>: When you’re cooking, turn your hot <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/">cookware</a> handles towards the backsplash to avoid from any pots from falling on the ground if your dog jumps up.</li>
<li><strong>Keep anything toxic out of reach</strong>: It might feel like second nature to keep all of your cleaning supplies under the sink, but you’ll want to make sure they aren’t accessible to a little explorer. Either lock your cabinet, or move them to a higher cabinet to get them out of reach.</li>
<li><strong>Secure your garbage</strong>: If your garbage can is easy to knock over or get into, secure it in a cabinet or make sure it’s sturdy enough to avoid from your little one toppling it over.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t use tablecloths</strong>: As you can imagine, tablecloths can easily mess up a dinner with a small tug. Avoid using tablecloths around dogs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Living Room</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Block off stairs and walkways</strong>: Restrict your dog’s access to the stairs and off-limit rooms with a quality <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-gates/">pet gate</a> that has an effective locking mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Tie up window cords</strong>: If you have cords dangling from your blinds or curtains, make sure they are far out of reach to your pet.</li>
<li><strong>Remove small items</strong>: Any small items on your coffee table, fireplace mantel or side tables such as decor, candles, plants and picture frames should be removed in the training phase.</li>
<li><strong>Block the fireplace</strong>: If you have an open fireplace, surround the area with a pet gate to avoid from your pet from getting near it, whether lit or not.</li>
<li><strong>Block exits</strong>: If your living room is near the front door, make sure that the doors shut properly and can’t be easily nudged open with a paw or nose.</li>
<li><strong>Put away children’s toys</strong>: If you don’t have a sealed container for toys already, it’s time to invest in one. Your dog will not know the difference between their toys and your children’s toys, so you’ll want to keep them off the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Garage</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check garage door sensor</strong>: Confirm that your <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-garage-door-opener/">garage door</a> discontinues from closing if someone runs under it before it touches the ground. That way, there is no chance for your dog to get caught if they run under it at the last second.</li>
<li><strong>Stow away hazardous substances</strong>: If you have antifreeze, lighter fluid, gasoline, oil or other harmful substances in your garage, make sure to put them out of sight and lock them up. Some of these substances can taste and smell sweet, so you don’t want your pet to get the wrong idea.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Backyard</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enforce the perimeter</strong>: Make sure that your yard is closed off with a fence that is high enough that your dog can’t jump over it.</li>
<li><strong>Remove items from fence perimeter</strong>: If you have a garbage can or supplies leaning against your fence, your dog can use it as a stepping stool to jump over the fence.</li>
<li><strong>Install a pool cover</strong>: If you have a pool, invest in a pool cover that locks so your dog can’t nudge and get under it.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t use pesticides</strong>: If you can avoid it, don’t use pesticides in your yard since it can be poisonous for dogs.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s common for pets to have stomach issues when your dog is changing diets or in a stressful situation. If possible, find out how they were eating prior to bringing them home and slowly transition them from one food to another.</p>
<p>It’s also easy for them to lose their appetite in new surroundings, so it could take time for them to eat a normal-sized meal. If you’re having trouble getting your dog to eat, try mixing their food with high-value food such as cooked shredded chicken or chicken stock. Over the course of several days, eventually wean them off the high-value food.</p>
<p>If they are still having trouble eating after a few days, consult with your veterinarian on alternative steps you can take.</p>

<p>Whether you’re adopting or picking up your dog from a breeder, make it a priority to confirm that they get their vaccinations if they don’t have them already. It’s common for diseases to spread from one dog to another in a shelter, so you’ll want to bring them to a veterinarian within one week of their adoption.</p>
<p>If you have a puppy, there are core vaccines and non-core vaccines that your veterinarian will walk you through during your appointment. The common core vaccines are: rabies, distemper, parvovirus and adenovirus. There are a number of non-core vaccines that your veterinarian will have you consider based on your dog’s circumstances.</p>
<p>If you have other pets at home, make sure that they’re healthy, are up-to-date on their vaccinations and are spayed or neutered.</p>

A pet microchip is a small electronic chip inserted under your dog’s skin that can be used to identify them if they go missing. It’s injected with a hypodermic needle, which is said to be as painful as a regular injection.</p>
<p>If your dog is found, an animal shelter or veterinary clinic can scan your them for their registration number, which is connected to your name and number in the registry. Microchipping your dog will give you the peace of mind if your pet is to ever go missing, and if your dog is in a new environment, it’s common for there to be escape attempts.</p>

<p>Although purchasing <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-insurance/">pet insurance</a> is not a requirement as a pet owner, it will allow you to make healthcare decisions for your pet without worrying or not if you can afford the treatment. Although you might be expecting to cover routine veterinary appointments, there is always potential for unexpected injuries and diseases.</p>
<blockquote class="ybd-featured-quote"><div class="ybd-featured-quote-inner"><p>Dog health insurance is your best friend if you own an accident prone dog, a large unhealthy breed, or simply don&#8217;t have thounsands of dollars in an emergency fund for unexpected vet bills.</p><footer class="ybd-featured-quote-footer"><cite>&mdash; Owner of a Great Dane</cite></footer></div></blockquote>
<p>Worried about the associated costs? The North American Pet Health Insurance Association’s (NAPHIA) 2018 State of the Industry Report indicates dog owners paid an average annual premium of $536 in 2017 for accident-and-illness plans. That equates to about $45 for a dog’s monthly premium.</p>
<p>For many dog owners, paying a monthly pet insurance premium is worth the chance that their pet is hurt or sick.</p>

<p>One of the most important ways to make your dog feel at home is by spending time with them. As you can imagine, neglect can lead to your dog acting out while seeking attention. The more time you spend prioritizing them, the more comfortable they’ll become.</p>
<p>If you incorporate your dog into your routine, spending time with them won’t feel like your carving time out of something else — it will come naturally. These are our favorite ways to incorporate our dogs into our routine.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bring them on errands</strong>: While you don’t want to keep your dog in the car when you’re running errands, take them along if your in dog-friendly stores and restaurants.</li>
<li><strong>Make them your workout buddy</strong>: Swap your time at the gym for something you can enjoy outside such as hiking, running or going for a walk.</li>
<li><strong>Socialize with your dog</strong>: Don’t skip out on time with your friends and family to stay in with your dog. Engage in activities in which you can bring your dog along with you.</li>
<li><strong>Go to a pet event</strong>: There are thousands of pet events that happen around the U.S. annually. Look for meet ups or events in your area that will allow you to socialize your dog with others in the area.</li>
<li><strong>Groom them yourself</strong>: Routinely complete grooming duties such as bathing, cleaning teeth, cleaning ears, trimming nails and brushing them.</li>

<p>You’ll likely want to show off your new dog as soon as you get home, but remember how overwhelming the experience can be for them. Wait a few days before inviting too many family and friends over so they have a chance to get accustomed to you and your immediate family.</p>
<p>Every dog has their own personality where some get excited by commotion and others get nervous. Take note of your dog’s behavior within the first few days around your family to determine when it’s a good time to introduce new people to them.</p>
<p>If you wait too long, your pet might become territorial, therefore, give them a few days to get adjusted and slowly start introducing more people.</p>

<p>Although you don’t want to overwhelm your dog on day one, it’s important that you socialize them with other dogs and people early on. Dogs have a reputation to be social, but their past could affect how they interact with others.</p>
<blockquote class="ybd-featured-quote"><div class="ybd-featured-quote-inner"><p>Be ready to get out excercising wand do a lot of socialization. Looking up the stages of puppy development can be very helpful for insight on critical development periods over the first few years.</p><footer class="ybd-featured-quote-footer"><cite>&mdash; Owner of a Pit Bull</cite></footer></div></blockquote>
<p>While every dog has their own personality when it comes to connecting with other dogs, it’s important that they are at least accustomed to seeing other dogs for scenarios where they encounter other dogs on a walk or an errand. The sweet spot for socializing a new puppy is between 3 to 12 weeks old.</p>
<p>Start training your dog as soon as you get home and make it part of their routine. If you have a puppy, they’ll have a short attention span, so you should make trainings brief. That said, they’ll be able to absorb obedience commands and potty training from an early age if you routinely commit around 15 minutes to training per day.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have an adult dog, it may take time to change their current habits and instil new commands. Although they might not absorb commands as quickly as a puppy, don’t give up. Build on their training with reward-based training methods.</p>

<p>Dogs thrive on a routine, so set regular times that you do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feeding</strong>: Consult with your veterinarian for the recommended type and amount of food you should feed your dog. Dog owners typically feed their dogs two smaller meals per day versus one large meal. Keep the dog bowl and location and timing consistent for every meal if possible.</li>
<li><strong>Sleeping</strong>: From the start, put your crate in the room that you want your dog to sleep in the long term. Make sure that the space is warm and cozy, and never have your dog sleep in an area that you wouldn’t such as the garage or in an unfinished basement. Try your best to remain consistent on the times that you put your dog in the crate and take them out of the crate every day.</li>
<li><strong>Daily walk</strong>: Keep your first walks short and close to home to help you determine your dog’s behavior when in a new environment and around different distractions.</li>
<li><strong>Letting them outside</strong>: Give your dog access to outside as much as you can, especially in the potty-training phase. Make it a routine that when they’re let out of their crate, they can immediately relieve themselves outside.</li>
<li><strong>Training</strong>: It’s easy to slack on training your dog, but consistency is key. Set up 10 to 15 minutes every day to train them.</li>
<li><strong>Alone time</strong>: You’ll have to get your dog accustomed to being solitary at times. You can do this by not giving them attention or comfort if they whine or bark while they are briefly alone. Only reward them when they are showing good behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, be patient. Some adopted dogs will have come from a loving home, while others might have been waiting at the shelter for years. Either way, it will take them time to get comfortable and familiar with their new routine.</p>

<h2 id="cats-need">What do cats need in their diet?</h2>
<p>Cats are obligate carnivores, which means that they are sustained solely on the nutrients found in animal meat. Cats evolved as hunters and consumed prey animals that provide a high level of protein, low to medium level of fat, high moisture (from the meat itself) and very little to almost no carbohydrates. In fact, there is <a href="https://feline-nutrition.org/nutrition/your-cats-nutritional-needs-the-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no known dietary carbohydrate requirement for a cat</a>. The only grains a cat in the wild might eat would be the remnants in a prey animal’s digestive tract.</p>
<p>Indoor cats, however, do not get their daily necessary nutrients from prey. Their diet needs supplements of minerals, fatty acids and amino acids. Two amino acids — taurine and argenine — are vital to a cat’s overall health.</p>
<p>Argenine helps a cat’s body process ammonia that is created during digestion. Taurine is vital for development of a cat’s eyes, heart, muscles and immune system. Both amino acids are naturally occurring in prey meat. Many cat food companies add taurine to dry cat food to compensate for the lack of meat in the food. It’s essential, however, that a cat eats meat every day to get the amino acids he/she requires to live a long and healthy life.</p>
<p>Renowned veterinarian Dr. Karen Becker promotes a &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/v0lFwdNm_Go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biologically appropriate diet</a>&#8221; to help your cat thrive. Your cat’s genetic makeup and internal workings are essentially the same as a wild carnivorous ancestor&#8217;s. A biologically appropriate (also called species appropriate) diet mimics a wild cat’s diet, which means high protein, high moisture, low fat and very low carbohydrates, all of which points to feeding your cat meat.</p>
<p>Dr. Becker also believes that many nutritional deficiencies and degenerative diseases in cats and dogs are directly linked to commercially processed pet foods. For decades, pet foods have been marketed as conveniences for pet owners. Many are cheaply made and loaded with corn (indigestible for both cats and dogs), soy, wheat gluten and other non-meat ingredients.</p>
<p>Cats are prone to potentially life-threatening illnesses resulting from carb overload. Indoor cats in particular are susceptible to obesity, type 2 diabetes, urinary tract issues and kidney disease. Several cat food manufacturers have upgraded their products. But many companies still make a product that provides little nutrition or benefit to your cat’s overall health.</p>
<h2 id="how-made">How is cat food made?</h2>
<h3>Canned</h3>
<p>The primary ingredients of canned cat food are fresh meat and meat by-products, which includes the cleaned carcass and internal organs of the slaughtered animal. The meat is frozen and either cut into chunks or ground. It is then steamed in water or broth, and the cooked meat is then combined with other ingredients, such as vegetables, grains, along with added vitamins and minerals. A starch or thickener is added to gel the mixture together. The mixture is packed into individual cans, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-vacuum-sealer/">vacuum-sealed</a> and sterilized in a heating chamber.</p>
<h3>Dry food</h3>
<p>Fresh or frozen meat and meat by-products are combined with ground grains, fats, vitamins, minerals and meals derived from ground bone or ground dehydrated meat or meat by-products. This mixture, resembling bread dough, is forced through an extruder, which cooks and cuts it into shapes. The pieces are then oven-dried, cooled and sprayed with flavor enhancers and preservatives.</p>
<h3>Freeze-dried</h3>
<p>Cut raw meat is placed inside a vacuum chamber, which freezes the meat solid. The chamber’s temperature is gradually increased and pressurized. The meat’s frozen internal liquid converts to vapor and is extracted. Freeze-dried food may be fed as-is or rehydrated.</p>
<h3>Dehydrated</h3>
<p>Conversely, dehydration involves a heat process of removing moisture from meat. Low heat is slowly applied to the raw product until it is completely dried. <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-food-dehydrator/">Dehydrated foods</a> must be rehydrated before feeding.</p>
<h2 id="standards">AAFCO standards for cat food</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.aafco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association of American Feed Control Officials</a> (AAFCO) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate pet food standards. The AAFCO is made up of scientists, veterinarians and animal nutritionists who have devised industry-wide standards for what ingredients can be used in manufacturing pet foods.  For any pet food to be deemed certified by the AAFCO, ingredients must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Species appropriate</li>
<li>Proven safe</li>
<li>Nutritionally adequate</li>
</ul>
<h3>AAFCO labeling rules</h3>
<p>Although neither the AAFCO nor FDA can enforce truth in advertising, cat food manufacturers must follow the AAFCO’s rules for the precise wording on the product label of how much and what kind of meat is in the food.</p>
<p><b>95-percent rule: </b>The named ingredient — for example, tuna or chicken — must weigh at least 95 percent of the total weight. If two ingredients are named on the label — tuna <i>and</i> chicken — then <i>together</i> they must weigh at least 95 percent of the total weight.</p>
<p><b>25-percent or “dinner” rule: </b>Cat food labeled as “dinner” must contain at least 25 percent of the named ingredient in the total weight. Other words you’ll see on the label that fall under the 25-percent rule are “entree,” “platter” and “formula.” If a second ingredient is listed — like “Tuna and Chicken Dinner” — then the second ingredient must weigh at least 3 percent of the total weight.</p>
<p><b>3-percent or “with” rule: </b>The AAFCO originally created this rule for pet foods that advertised a minor ingredient in the food. It’s been modified so the word <b>“with”</b> — as in “Cat Food With Tuna” — means that at least 3 percent of the total weight is actually tuna.</p>
<p><b>Flavor: </b>“Tuna Flavor Cat Food” means that tuna is an ingredient, but it only needs to be detectable. Many cat-food companies use “digest,” which is a flavor enhancer made out of the liquid of boiled meats (usually poultry or beef), to be in accordance with this labeling rule.</p>
<p><b>Natural: </b>“Natural” means ingredients made from animals, plants or minerals that have not been chemically processed except for standard preparation procedures. “100-percent natural” or “all-natural” means that there are no synthetic ingredients in the food.</p>
<p><b>Organic: </b>The <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/programs-offices/national-organic-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Agriculture </a>(USDA) has the same requirements for cat food as it does for food consumed by people. For ingredients to be labeled as organic, they must be produced without synthetic fertilizers, irradiation or genetic engineering. The USDA does not take an official position as to whether organic foods are healthier or more nutritious than non-organic foods.</p>
<h3>AAFCO definitions of ingredients</h3>
<p>The AAFCO is very specific about the proper naming of ingredients. The majority of pet food companies do not use ingredients intended for human consumption.  When you read the label of canned or dry cat food, make sure that the meat or fish used is actually identified.</p>
<p>A major controversy in the pet-food industry is a manufacturer using what is known as 4-D —  diseased, dying, down or dead — animal meat that is deemed by the FDA as unfit for human consumption. Although the FDA has “<a href="https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074712.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compliance guidelines</a>” that forbid using 4-D meat as a potential health hazard, many veterinarians and pet nutritionists believe the FDA is unable to regulate all suppliers of meat for pet food.</p>
<p>So if a cat food label doesn’t state what species of animal was used to harvest its meat, you have no idea what you’re feeding your beloved tabby. The worst cat foods we analyzed listed only “animal” or a body part, such as liver, of an unidentified animal in the ingredients. We can&#8217;t surmise why, but we found more unidentified animal meat in cat food than we did when <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-dog-food/">dog food review</a>.</p>
<p>All ingredients are required to be listed in order by weight. Primary ingredients — those with the most weight — will be the first four or five listed. Meat or fish should always be the first ingredient. Water or broth is needed to cook the meat in canned food, so it will usually be the second or third ingredient.</p>
<p>The same rule applies to dry food before processing. Chicken could be listed as the first ingredient, but once that chicken’s been cooked and dehydrated, nearly 75 percent of its original weight is lost.</p>
<p>The following three AAFCO definitions apply to all meat processed in pet food.</p>
<p><b>Meat</b> is defined as “the clean flesh of slaughtered mammals and is limited to muscle tissue attached to the skeleton by tendons with or without the accompanying and overlying fat and the portions of the skin, sinew, nerve and blood vessels which normally accompany the flesh.”</p>
<p><b>Meat by-products</b> are rendered animal parts deemed not suitable for human consumption. They include internal organs, heads, feet, hair and unhatched eggs. Although by-products are not considered esthetically pleasing by many people, they are safe and nutritious for cats.</p>
<p><b>Meat meal and by-product meal </b>are meat and meat by-products, including bone, from which fat and moisture have been removed. Bone meal is similar to meat and by-product meals, but it can include entire carcasses. Unlike meat and meat by-products, animals other than cattle, sheep and goats may be used without identification on the label.</p>

<p>First, read the label. The FDA and AAFCO together enforce the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/Products/AnimalFoodFeeds/IngredientsAdditives/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required labeling of pet foods</a>. All pet foods must be labeled with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingredients</li>
<li>Manufacturer’s name and address</li>
<li>Feeding directions</li>
<li>Calorie statement</li>
<li>Guaranteed analysis</li>
<li>Nutritional adequacy statement</li>
</ul>
<p>All manufacturers of cat food must comply with the FDA’s regulations to sell their product. As long as the manufacturer follows the rules for labeling, they are free to add virtually any ingredient to their cat food.</p>
<h3>Guaranteed analysis</h3>
<p>Guaranteed analysis lists the percentages of minimum crude protein and crude fat, moisture and maximum crude fiber. “Crude,” however, does not refer to the quality of the nutrient but to the method of estimating the quantity of the nutrient.</p>
<p>This is where it gets confusing. If you see 10-percent minimum crude protein listed on a can of wet cat food, it’s not the actual amount of protein. The only way to determine the nutritional value of a dry or wet cat food is to calculate what’s called the “dry matter basis.” At first glance, it may seem overly complex to figure out, but it’s quite easy.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Step 1:</b> Subtract the percentage of moisture listed on the canned food’s label from 100. As an example, the label on the canned food lists moisture as 78 percent. Subtract 78 from 100, leaving you with 22 percent of dry matter.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Divide the percentage of protein listed on the label — in our example, 10 percent — by the dry matter 22 percent, equaling .45.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> Multiply that result by 100, and this will now give you the actual percentage of protein in the canned food, which, in our example, is 45 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Repeat the calculation with the percentage of fat listed on the label, and you’ll get an accurate representation of how much fat is in the food. The dry matter basis works for dry food as well. Compare them, and you’ll understand how much protein and fat each actually has.</p>
<h3>Nutritional adequacy statement</h3>
<p>Any cat food manufacturer that claims its product is “complete and balanced” must be labeled with the AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement. The food has been tested using AAFCO Feeding Trial Protocols under strict guidelines. Look for this statement on the packaging, usually near the ingredient list:</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Cat Food Nutrition Profiles for all life stages.”</i></p>
<p>If you don’t see the AAFCO’s nutritional adequacy statement, the product has not met the AAFCO’s stringent standards.</p>
<h3>“Made in the USA”</h3>

<p>By the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s definition, “made in the USA” means that all or virtually all of a product has been made in the U.S. The FTC is less strict, however, about pet foods. A manufacturer of cat food may indeed process its product in the U.S., but it may source lower-grade ingredients <em>outside</em> of the U.S.</p>
<p>The best you can do to ensure that the cat food you buy is made with U.S.-sourced ingredients is checking whether the company has taken the <a href="https://associationfortruthinpetfood.com/the-pledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association for Truth in Pet Food’s Pledge to Quality and Origin of Ingredients</a>.</p>
<h3>Ingredients to avoid</h3>
<p>The following ingredients should not be in any cat food that you buy. Most will be found in cheaper brands as alternatives to higher-grade ingredients.</p>
<p><b>BHT or BHA: </b>Chemical preservatives added to fats to prevent spoilage. Banned in most countries for potential links to cancer, these chemical preservatives are still added to certain cat foods in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p><b>Beef tallow: </b>A low-cost fat that’s added as a flavor enhancer.</p>
<p><b>Carrageenan: </b>A thickener used in cat food with a gravy. Some research shows that certain by-products of carrageenan could induce gastric inflammation in both humans and animals, though <a href="https://medium.com/@edithmcamellia/what-youre-getting-wrong-about-carrageenan-e9f56e3ed1c5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the debate is raging on what to do about the additive itself</a>.</p>
<p><b>Corn syrup, fructose and sucrose:  </b>These sugars and other sweeteners are added to make lower-grade ingredients taste better.</p>
<p><b>Corn: </b>Often found as the first ingredient in cheaper brands of dry cat food, corn has little nutritional benefit for cats and adds unnecessary sugar and carbohydrates to their diet.</p>
<p><b>Ethoxyquin: </b>First created as a pesticide and a food preservative, ethoxyquin has been linked to cancer. It’s banned from human food, but it’s used in cat food as a preservative for fish and fish meal. A cat food manufacturer is not required to list ethoxyquin on the label if fish or fish meal was purchased from a supplier outside of the U.S.</p>
<p><b>Food dyes: </b>Often used in cat kibble, Blue 2, Red 40 and Yellow 5 and 6 have been linked to cancer in test animals. The dyes are added to appeal to your eyes, not your cat’s digestive system.</p>
<p><b>Generic animal fat: </b>If the animal fat isn’t identified on the label, you’ll have no idea from what species of animal the fat has been trimmed.</p>
<p><b>Sodium tripolyphosphate:</b> This FDA-approved salt is used as a preservative in meats to retain moisture so they weigh more and appear to be fresher. In Europe, it is an allowed additive listed as E451. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (a division of the CDC) suspects sodium tripolyphosphate may be a neurotoxin.</p>
<p><b>Wheat gluten: </b>Added as a filler to replace higher-grade proteins. Like humans, some cats cannot process gluten and may suffer gastric distress when eating it.</p>

<h3>Canned</h3>
<p><b>The primary ingredients are an identified whole meat:</b> The first ingredient should be an identified whole meat. Water or broth for processing will be second. The third and fourth ingredients should also be other identified whole meats.  If you see brown rice or corn or barley as the third or fourth ingredients, that’s too much filler and will add carbohydrates.</p>
<p><b>Whole unprocessed vegetables: </b>The nutrients, vitamins and antioxidants of whole foods will survive processing better than ground vegetables. For example, “peas” are more nutritious than “pea flour.”</p>
<p><b>Limited carbohydrates: </b>Don’t assume that if a food is grain-free that it has less carbohydrates. Many grain-free cat foods have starchy vegetables, like potatoes or sweet potatoes, which add unnecessary carbohydrates.</p>
<p><b>High protein, low fat, high moisture:</b> The AAFCO recommends a minimum daily consumption of 30 percent protein and 9 percent fat for kittens, and 26 percent protein and 9 percent fat for adult cats. These guidelines are simply for a cat’s survival. For a healthy adult cat, pet nutritionists recommend approximately 40 percent protein and 20-25 percent fat. All of the canned foods we analyzed had 78 percent moisture.</p>
<p><b>AAFCO nutritional statement: </b>Look for a statement on the can’s label that the food “provides complete and balanced nutrition for all life stages.”</p>
<h3>Dry</h3>
<p><b>The first three ingredients are an identified whole meat: </b>If you see salmon listed first, that’s great. But remember that salmon loses up to 75 percent of its weight during processing. So to make up for that loss, the second and third ingredients should be other identified whole meats (or fish) or meat (or fish) meal.</p>
<p><b>Whole vegetables and limited whole grains: </b>Whole vegetables and grains will retain more nutritional value than vegetable or grain flours during processing. Grains add carbohydrates, so look for dry foods that have grains lower on the list of ingredients.</p>
<p><b>Appropriate protein-to-fat ratio: </b>Using the dry method basis, the best dry foods we analyzed averaged between 38-44 percent protein and 17-22 percent fat, which is considered appropriate for healthy adult cats.</p>
<p><b>AAFCO nutritional statement: </b>“Provides complete and balanced nutrition for all life stages” should be on the food’s label.</p>

<p>Our recommendations are based on research and the analysis of fifty products that can be purchased at grocery stores, pet supply stores, supermarkets and online. We’ve consulted veterinarians and pet food nutrition experts for their opinions about what criteria cat food should meet to be considered exceptional.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-dog-food/">our review of dog foods</a>, we recommended Orijen &#8211; Original as the best grain-free dry food. We now recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3IBQG2/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orijen &#8211; Cat &amp; Kitten</a> as the best dry food for cats. All Orijen products are biologically appropriate, which translates to grain-free, high in protein and low in carbs. Orijen is a Canadian company that takes pride in using whole meats and fish in their foods. (Recently, Orijen began manufacturing in Kentucky as well.)</p>
<p>The ingredient list for the Cat &amp; Kitten formula is impressive. The first ten ingredients are deboned chicken and deboned turkey, whole eggs, whole fish and whole chicken and turkey organs, such as heart and liver. Because so much moisture is lost during processing, and the whole meats and fish lose 75 percent of their weight, Orijen makes up for the loss by adding dehydrated meats and fish. Other pet food companies we analyzed add filler, such as rice or potatoes, to compensate for the loss in weight.</p>
<p>The added greens are also unique. Mustard greens, collard greens, kale and spinach are often called &#8220;power greens,&#8221; nutrient-dense and loaded with Vitamins A and C.</p>
<p>There are several legumes in the mixture — pinto, lentils and peas — these are controversial ingredients in cat food, since cats wouldn’t eat them in the wild. However, legumes are considered to be a healthy carbohydrate: High in fiber and protein, low in fat and vitamin rich. Protein-to-fat ratio is an appropriate two-to-one with 44 percent protein and 22 percent fat.</p>

No other dry cat food compares to Orijen’s high-quality ingredients.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3IBQG2/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Orijen has several other recipes that are marketed as “Whole Prey” to cat owners who want to feed their cat a more wild diet. The Tundra recipe, for example, has goat and wild boar, and the Regional Red has angus beef, wild boar, goat and Yorkshire pork. These recipes seem a bit rich, but surprisingly, they all have the same appropriate protein-to-fat ratio.</p>
<p>Champion Pet Foods manufactures Orijen and Acana, another high-end dry cat food. Acana&#8217;s four recipes also feature locally sourced meats, fish and game meats. Their website states that Acana&#8217;s dry foods contain 75 percent meat and fish and are biologically appropriate. There is certainly a lot of meat and meat meals in the Acana recipes, but with the added filler of several legumes, which cats don&#8217;t eat in the wild, we&#8217;re not recommending Acana. It&#8217;s a very good dry cat food, but Orijen is better.</p>
<p>All Orijen products are more expensive than other dry foods, but no other dry cat food we found can beat the amount of quality meat that Orijen puts into its food.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Orijen combines fresh and raw meats and fish with dehydrated for a dry food that is unparalleled in the amount of meat as primary and secondary ingredients.</li>
<li>With 90 percent meat, other ingredients are vitamin-packed power greens and several legumes as healthy carbohydrates.</li>
<li>Orijen has several other high-protein recipes with rich and lean wild game meats.</li>

<p>New Zealand-based Ziwi Peak is one of the few pet food companies that only uses locally sourced and free-range meats and poultry. Ziwi Peak has developed their cat food recipes specifically for a cat’s biological needs: rich with lots of meat and very low in carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Understanding that not every cat’s digestive system can tolerate chicken or beef, Ziwi Peak also makes recipes with game meats (like rabbit and venison) which, for some cats, are more digestible. The company also has a few recipes with mackerel and hoki, a New Zealand white fish.</p>
<p>All of the Ziwi Peak foods are excellent and are packed with 92 percent meat (or meat and fish). There are a few complaints online that Ziwi Peak used to boast 93 percent, but we think that’s quibbling. One glance at the ingredients list, and you’ll see why Ziwi Peak is the best canned cat food you can buy.</p>
<p>The recipe we recommend is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUXQ6IW/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mackerel and lamb</a>. The primary ingredients are mackerel, water (for processing) and lamb, including lamb organs and chickpeas (which are actually pretty far down on the list). Essential minerals and vitamins are added, including taurine, but there are no grains, starches, preservatives or additives that have known harmful effects.</p>
<p>We should also note that Ziwi Peak is one of the few companies that adds green-lipped mussels to their pet foods. Green-lipped mussels are native to New Zealand and have <a href="http://lyprinoluk.com/pdf/halpern.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proven anti-inflammatory properties</a> for humans and pets.</p>

Adding to this protein mix are New Zealand green-lipped mussels, which help strengthen and support muscles and joints.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUXQ6IW/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The mackerel and lamb recipe has a two-to-one protein-to-fat ratio with 40 percent protein and 20 percent fat. The rabbit and lamb recipe is substantially higher in protein (50 percent) and not surprisingly, since rabbit is a lean meat, only 15 percent fat.</p>
<p>A drawback for some people might be that all Ziwi Peak products are expensive, running about $3.50 per 6.5 ounce can with a recommended feeding portion of one can per day. Ziwi Peak can be purchased online by the case, and it’s definitely cheaper per can than purchasing a couple cans at a time. The quality of the ingredients is undeniable, however, and from our analysis, we believe improving your cat&#8217;s diet is worth this canned food&#8217;s higher price.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>All of Ziwi Peak’s cat foods contain 92 percent locally sourced meats and fish.</li>
<li>Their recipes were designed specifically for a cat’s biological needs and are high in protein, moderate-to-low fat and very low in carbohydrates.</li>
<li>A few recipes use game meats, like venison and rabbit, which for some cats are easier to digest.</li>
<li>Ziwi Peak products are more expensive than other brands, but the quality of the ingredients is worth the cost.</li>

<p>Instinct Raw Boost combines a grain-free kibble with freeze-dried raw chicken, duck or rabbit, depending on the recipe. The chicken recipe and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDL6SMQ/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">duck recipe</a> are recommended for outdoor/indoor cats, and because rabbit is lower in fat, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDF6CT8/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rabbit recipe</a> is recommended for indoor cats, who are less active. There’s also a weight-control formula, but it’s only 1 percent lower in fat than the rabbit recipe (14 percent).</p>
<p>Both the duck and rabbit recipes start out with whole meat, followed by four meat meals, which is exceptional. Like many other kibbles, one of the primary ingredients is peas, tapioca and/or chickpeas. But Instinct throws in the freeze-dried meat cubes as a bonus, boosting up the protein and providing another excellent source of raw meat.</p>
<p>Also added to the ingredients are small amounts of freeze-dried rabbit heart, lung and kidney, so it’s not surprising that Instinct Raw Boost has one of the higher percentages of protein (43 percent) among the dry foods we analyzed.</p>

<p>Rachel Ray certainly isn’t the first chef to create a line of pet foods inspired by chef recipes. We admit we were skeptical, until we took a closer look. Rachel Ray Nutrish has three varieties on the market: the original brand, called Nutrish, and two specialty brands, Nutrish &#8211; Peak and Nutrish &#8211; Zero Grain. We examined all three, and Zero Grain has a lot more meat and a lot less filler than Nutrish and Peak.</p>
<p>There are two recipes for Zero Grain: chicken and potato or whitefish and potato. (Maybe somebody needs to tell Rachel to lay off the carbs.) However, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YXSQEOG/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the whitefish and potato recipe</a> is actually very good. Yes, it has potato, but it’s not in the primary ingredients. The first four ingredients are whitefish, salmon meal, menhaden fish meal and turkey meal. So, there’s more protein than filler in this formula.</p>
<p>Zero Grain has an appropriate two-to-one protein-to-fat ratio, but it is slightly lower in both than other dry foods we analyzed (38 percent protein and 17 percent fat). Nutrish &#8211; Zero Grain is modestly priced, and for a food that doesn’t have by-products, it’s a good value.</p>
<h3>Castor &amp; Pollux &#8211; Pristine</h3>
<p>The Pristine line of Castor &amp; Pollux’s excellent pet foods promises that their meats are harvested from animals who lived happy, healthy, free-roaming lives, and their fish are wild-caught.</p>
<p>There’s little doubt that the quality of the ingredients in the grain-free Pristine recipes are top-notch. But of the four varieties, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076JDTC5T/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wild-caught tuna</a>. (It’s also the most popular of the Pristine line with cat owners.) The other three products have dried egg and organic peas in their primary ingredients. The tuna recipe also has the egg and peas, but the big difference is that organic chicken and chicken liver are in the top five.</p>
<p>With these meat additions, the Pristine tuna has an above average three-to-one protein-to-fat ratio with protein at 40 percent and fat at a low 13 percent, which makes this canned food great for indoor cats.</p>
<h3>Applaws</h3>
<p>MPM (Making Pet Food Matter) is a fairly new pet food company. Incorporated in 2002 and based in the United Kingdom, MPM produces and distributes Applaws around the world. The company is very strict about where and from whom they source meats, and you can tell with one look at their high-end product that they use human-grade meats and fish.</p>
<p>There are seven varieties of canned food, each with three or four ingredients; for example, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DBUKXJ4/z/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tuna, seaweed, fish broth and rice</a> or chicken breast with cheese. Applaws sells the same food in pouches, which have windows, and you can see for yourself just how appetizing they are.</p>
<p>Each recipe is high in protein and very low in fat; in fact, they’re too low in fat for a healthy cat. Applaws knows they’ve made an exceptional food, but because of the very low fat, they cannot recommend it as a stand-alone meal. It’s very clearly stated on the cans, pouches and website that their food is supplemental and will not provide all the necessary daily nutrients.</p>
<p>However, if you’re looking to add a tasty topper to your cat’s regular (and hopefully, balanced nutritionally) food, then consider Applaws.</p>

<p>We understand that some pet foods are too expensive for people living on a limited budget. But we believe that there are products you can buy in any supermarket that are better made and healthier for your cat than those with familiar brand names. Your cat may enjoy the taste, but only because these low-grade foods have been treated with additives and flavor enhancers.</p>
[table id=246 /]
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B000R4CJQ2/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meow Mix &#8211; Original</a>: This long-time favorite is an example of what pet food should not be. Its number-one ingredient is ground yellow corn, which, as we’ve pointed out, has almost no nutritional benefits for cats. The second ingredient is corn gluten meal; again, more corn and empty calories. Chicken by-product meal provides the meat source. Other primary ingredients are beef tallow (fat) and “animal digest,” which is nothing more than the boiled down juices of some unidentified animal. It’s cheap, and there’s a reason for that.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0040PYRZU/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Purina Deli-Cat</a>: This popular dry food is another cheap brand you should avoid. As with many Purina products for both cats and dogs, ground yellow corn is the primary ingredient. As if soybean meal and corn gluten meal (ingredients two and three) weren’t bad enough, other primary ingredients are “meat and bone meal” and “animal fat.” Both of these ingredients are low-quality, and because the species of animal isn&#8217;t stated, the meat and fat could have been harvested from any animal? Lastly, two carcinogenic food colorings, Red 40 and Yellow 5, give this kibble its unnatural hues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002CJAOPI/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Purina Friskies &#8211; Mixed Grill</a>: Friskies is another popular brand with an array of canned foods labeled with appetizing names. Look at the label, and you’ll realize it’s junk food. For the mixed grill recipe, the first ingredient is meat by-products. So straight off, your cat will be nibbling on the carcass of an unidentified animal. The other primary ingredients are poultry by-products (could be any bird’s carcass), liver (could be any animal’s liver) and rice. Friskies is also one of the few products we examined that had carrageenan, which some say induces gastric inflammation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DL797S/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whiskas &#8211; Choice Cuts</a>: Whiskas is one of the largest manufacturers of cat food, and we analyzed several of their products. They all had the same problem: water for processing is their number one — meaning, the heaviest — ingredient. In this variety pack, all four have chicken, unidentified meat by-products and wheat gluten. Whiskas adds an infinitesimal amount of beef or tuna to their basic chicken recipe. As long as the cat can detect it, Whiskas has followed the AAFCO rule about what defines “flavor.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003MWERTS/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hill’s Science Diet &#8211; Indoor</a>: You might be surprised to see the much-hyped Hill’s Science Diet on this list. Hill’s has done a brilliant job at marketing. Their prescription diets are excellent and can only be purchased from a veterinarian. Their supermarket brand, however, is much lower quality. For this kibble, the first ingredient is chicken. It goes downhill from there. Whole grain wheat, corn gluten meal, wheat gluten and brewers rice pack this food with carbs. Way down on the list, a little chicken liver flavor is thrown in. Don’t be fooled by the advertising; the supermarket line is based on poor science.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Your cat’s age, weight and activity level will determine what’s the best cat food for him/her, and you should consult with your veterinarian if you’re considering switching foods. During our analysis of ingredients and nutritional statements of 50 dry and canned cat foods, we found many examples of products you should never feed your cat.</p>
<p>However, there were several stand-outs that upheld the standards of AAFCO’s regulations for “complete and balanced nutrition at all life stages.”</p>
<p>We recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3IUWHQ/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Orijen &#8211; Cat &amp; Kitten</a> as the best dry food. This biologically appropriate food is a high-protein smorgasbord of ten whole meats and fish, whole eggs and dehydrated meats. It’s more expensive than other dry foods, but it’s certainly one of the best you could feed your kitty.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUXQ6IW/?tag=ybdcatfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ziwi Peak</a> is an excellent example of what all canned cat foods should be. Each can has 92 percent locally sourced meat and/or fish from New Zealand. Ziwi Peak also uses lower-fat game meats and New Zealand green-lipped mussels, a unique protein source that has proven anti-inflammatory properties. It&#8217;s also more expensive than other brands of wet cat food, but you will be feeding your cat the best.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing five vacuums in three different apartments and running controlled tests side by side, we&#8217;ve determined that the Shark &#8211; Apex is the best upright vacuum. This predator is at the top of the food chain with quiet power and effective cleaning on more surfaces than most other upright vacuum cleaners. The entry-level Shark &#8211; Navigator is also a good value at about half the price, and the Dirt Devil won a spot among our top picks with compact maneuverability.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After spending the last year researching and testing selections for task-specific categories like <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">the best vacuums for pet owners</a>, <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">handheld vacuums</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuums</a>, we were ready to tackle a more general overview of the vacuum market.</p>
<p>We read comparison reviews by traditional publications like Wirecutter and Consumer Reports, but we also sunk hours into the endless testing footage available from vacuum enthusiasts on YouTube. We also investigated the latest buzz on the r/vacuums subreddit.</p>
<p>Vacuum cleaners, like many appliances, are often sold with different model numbers or packages at different retailers. Even finding the most recent models or determining differences between model numbers is sometimes nearly impossible. Our researcher compared specs on 18 different models for Shark alone, and that&#8217;s just the currently available models.</p>
<p>We included Shark&#8217;s perennial classic, the Navigator, since it&#8217;s their best value in terms of power for dollar and is still readily available. We also included the new Shark &#8211; Apex AZ1002, a model with all of Shark&#8217;s latest bells and whistles at a correspondingly higher price.</p>
<p>Selecting a worthy competitor for the Apex was tough. Every review of the Shark vacuums praises their relative maneuverability, while Dyson vacuums (though powerful) tend to be considered clunky by comparison. We selected the Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2 rather than the larger, heavier, more expensive Animal or Cinetic models. (Some reviews actually show the Multi Floor to be more powerful than the Animal.)</p>
<p>Shark and Dyson have the high-end bagless vacuum market pretty much to themselves these days. We did find some well-regarded competitors in the budget bracket, though, with affordable and lightweight models from Dirt Devil and Eureka that had excellent customer reviews.</p>

[table id=240 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Cleaning path:</strong> A wider cleaning path means fewer passes to clean an area, but it usually also makes a vacuum less maneuverable.</p>
<p><strong>Edge cleaning gap:</strong> This is a measurement of the distance of the pickup track from the edge, which determines how much dirt is missed when you&#8217;re vacuuming along baseboards or furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Steering design:</strong> Dyson really made a name for themselves with the &#8220;big ball&#8221; steering design, but we&#8217;ve come a long way since the days when every vacuum handled like a giant commercial model. Swivelling heads are now a common feature that actually made two other brands easier to turn than the Dyson.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:</strong> Upright vacuums typically come with hose attachments that help you clean things like stairs, couches and drapes. Great attachments really make some jobs easier, but if you don&#8217;t have any upholstered furniture you might find yourself keeping them in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> Lower weight is always better for carrying and using a vacuum, so long as you aren&#8217;t giving up features you need. This is also an important factor if you&#8217;re vacuuming on hardwood, since lighter vacuums are less likely to leave scuff marks.</p>
<p><strong>Noise:</strong> All vacuums are loud, but some are louder than others. Sleeping housemates will thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Filter performance and sealed systems:</strong> High efficiency particulate air (&#8220;HEPA&#8221;) filters are common, and the filter itself almost always does a great job filtering out even the smallest dust particles. The big difference between vacuums is whether they&#8217;re fully sealed or just let dust escape out of cracks and gaps.</p>

<p><strong>Height to fit under furniture:</strong> Coffee tables, beds and other low-clearance furniture can be tricky to vacuum under. Low-profile vacuum beater heads can slip into more places without stopping to use a specialty attachment.</p>
<p><strong>Cord Length:</strong> You want to be able to vacuum your entire floor without switching outlets, so cord length is a big priority for larger rooms or even just getting down the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>Length of hose:</strong> If you want to get the most out of your specialty attachments, it&#8217;s nice to be able to roam a bit. This is especially important for high ceilings.</p>

<p><strong>Total reach:</strong> This spec is usually a combination of cord length and hose length, plus the longest extension attachment. We think it makes more sense to think about your needs for cord length and hose length separately, though.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty and service network:</strong> In the past, vacuum repair worked like car repair: You buy an expensive machine from a dealer and take it back in for repairs. Dyson still has a repair network, while Shark works mostly by shipping things in the mail.</p>
<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs an upright vacuum?</h2>
<p>Upright vacuums are great on carpet. If you&#8217;ve got wall-to-wall medium-pile carpet, an upright vacuum is probably going to be your first choice. If you have more than 500 square feet of carpet to clean, an upright also makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>For bare floors, like hardwood or tile, an upright vacuum usually isn&#8217;t the best choice. Picks from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-steam-mop/">steam mop review</a> will be a much better choice on tile or vinyl, though a good upright vacuum will still pick up dirt.</p>
<p>Being able to turn off the brushroll is an important feature if you&#8217;re going to use an upright on bare floors, since the brush will usually scatter dirt too much and doesn’t really help on a bare floor. Brushroll control is a standard feature for all the vacuums we looked at.</p>
<p>Upright vacuums put the weight of the motor above the brushroll, which helps it work into carpet fibers. That extra weight pushing down helps with getting out tough dirt, and for &#8220;grooming&#8221; longer carpet into that gorgeous freshly vacuumed look.</p>
<p>A good upright vacuum also makes cleaning floors more convenient. An upright keeps all of your vacuum parts rolling on one set of wheels, which means you only have to stop vacuuming when you get to the end of your cord.</p>
<p>The cordless models from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a> are even more convenient to carry around. An upright is wider, though, so it can clean more quickly, and it can also go longer before the dust cup fills up. Most importantly, a plug-in upright won&#8217;t run out of battery power before you finish cleaning.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, an upright vacuum puts the suction motor, roller brush and dust receptacle in one piece riding on wheels with a long handle. A canister vacuum separates the motor and dust receptacle from the tools with a long hose, so you typically have most of the weight of the vacuum in a piece that follows you around on the floor while you hold the attachments and pickup tools.</p>
<p>Upright vacuums are similar to the oldest designs, basically adding suction and a bag to 19th-century carpet sweeper designs like the Bissel. Early upright designs were called &#8220;suction sweepers,&#8221; while early canister designs were called &#8220;suction dusters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those names highlight the strengths of each design: Upright vacuums are very efficient for &#8220;sweeping&#8221; over large surfaces, while the maneuverability and flexibility of a canister&#8217;s detached hose make it perfect for vacuuming things that aren&#8217;t your floor.</p>
<p>That said, most upright vacuums sold to consumers deliberately allow you to use a flexible hose and attachments, so you can still clean your drapes and upholstery.</p>
<p>Likewise, canister vacuums typically come with long-handled floor-sweeping attachments, and some even come with very nice electric-powered brushroll systems for plush carpet.</p>
<p>An upright vacuum really shines if you need to clean up and down a carpeted hall. The cord is long enough that you can finish the job without unplugging, and you won&#8217;t have to drag a canister along behind you. It&#8217;s also easier to store in a closet because of the small footprint.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re cleaning smaller rooms with lots of furniture, the lighter weight and low-profile head of a canister vacuum&#8217;s pickup tool make it much easier to work under and around obstacles. The drawbacks start when you have to move the canister body while you&#8217;re vacuuming.</p>
<p>Canister vacuums often come with air-powered tools, which means that only the flow of air is powering the brushroll that&#8217;s picking up hair and dirt from your carpet. Air-powered tools are better than nothing in a pinch, but they&#8217;re not nearly as effective as a motor-driven brush. We found out when testing the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">best pet hair vacuums</a> that just because a canister vacuum is expensive doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s always the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>Shark&#8217;s popular &#8220;lift-away&#8221; vacuum design tries to split the difference between a canister and an upright. If you want to separate the bulky motor housing from the floor tools you can just push a button and detach it. The hose is very short compared to a purpose-built canister system, but it has many of the same strengths when you need to vacuum under a bed or on carpeted stairs.</p>
<p>Note that among Shark models, only the powered lift-away models can run the brushroll motor when the base is detached. The un-powered Navigator, however, can still do bare-floor cleaning just as capably in this mode.</p>
<h2 id="why-bagless">Why a bagless vacuum cleaner?</h2>

<p>It might seem like distant history, but for most of the hundred or so years of vacuum cleaning we&#8217;ve relied on a bag to capture dirt that&#8217;s picked up. Once the bag was full, you had to throw it away and replace it with a new one. Bags could be made from paper for cheaper designs, but more expensive bags used other materials for better reliability and filtration.</p>
<p>Various bagless vacuum designs have been tried, but it was James Dyson who really popularized the bagless concept. Dyson pioneered the use of &#8220;cyclonic&#8221; airflow to separate dirt inside the dust receptacle through centrifugal force. Twenty years later, nearly all consumer-grade vacuums are bagless.</p>
<p>Without cyclonic dust removal, filters are the weak point of any vacuum system. If the filter is too fine, not enough air will get through and they will plug up quickly. If the filter lets a lot of air through, dust particles will also escape. Bag systems slowly lose suction efficiency as the filter pores fill with dust.</p>
<p>Modern bagless vacuums all use cyclonic action to separate dust, which means they can all use HEPA filters and filter-exhaust air down to sub-micron particles without instantly plugging up. Bagless systems generally use filters that are designed to be washed, so you should never have to buy replacement parts.</p>
<p>One more perk of bagless designs is that you can more easily find a piece of jewelry or a micro SD card that you accidentally pick up.</p>
<p>The savings are a relief, and not having to hunt for replacement bags when your vacuum is discontinued is nothing to sneeze at, either. But there is at least one downside to bagless designs.</p>
<p>When your vacuum collects dirt in a bag, you can simply throw it away and move on if you pick up something sticky, smelly or otherwise nasty. With a bagless vacuum, you&#8217;ve got to clean out the plastic receptacle and wash the filter.</p>
<p>In the marketplace, bagless has been a clear winner. You can still find a few of the old standby brands that maintain marketshare among commercial users, but even Panasonic has left the US vacuum cleaner market altogether after making Kenmore&#8217;s vacuums for decades.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We tested each of these vacuums in real-world conditions over the course of two months in three different apartments. We also spent a week testing for specific performance criteria in side-by-side dirt pickup tests on different types of carpet, and we measured noise and dust output.</p>
<p>After all that testing, we sat down and analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each vacuum to decide which buyers they could be best for.<br />
[table id=241 /]
<h3>Maneuverability and weight</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/maneuverability.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We tested maneuverability around everyday living-room furniture. Weight played a big role in improving the scores of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a>, which also swivels well for quick turns. The Shark &#8211; Apex kept up, though, despite weighing about four pounds more than the budget-priced uprights.</p>
<p>The other surprising results for maneuverability were the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAGRRRU/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; PowerSpeed</a> models. The Dyson ball design just seems stiff and clunky compared to the new swivel-head designs from other makers. And remember, this is a lighter, smaller sibling in the Dyson family.</p>
<p>The Eureka was definitely the most frustrating, though. Without any consideration for swiveling, even the low weight made just turning it around at the end of a hallway far more difficult than it was with the other models.</p>
<p>The dust cups in this roundup were surprisingly similar. Dyson has a slight edge with a one-button release and dump system that makes emptying easier, though figuring out how hard to press the button takes some getting used to. Putting the Dyson&#8217;s pieces back in place is sometimes tricky, too. The other systems also have a drop-away bottom that makes emptying dirt easy, but fiddling with their latches isn&#8217;t quite as elegant.</p>
<p>Dyson&#8217;s outer canister separates completely from the cyclonic separator piece, so it&#8217;s easier to do a deep-clean if something gets lodged in there. None of the other dust receptacles were especially bad at trapping debris, but the Dyson system is (as one might expect) very elegant.</p>
<h3>Under-furniture height</h3>
<p>Measuring the height of each vacuum&#8217;s head gives an idea of how low the base of your furniture can be before the vacuum won&#8217;t fit at all. A model like the Dyson may fit under your couch part-way, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it will actually vacuum underneath. Most upright vacuums are too bulky, so you need to use an accessory tool on the hose to get all the dust bunnies.</p>
<p>Shark&#8217;s powered lift-away system on the Apex has a definite edge here. With the motor body removed, the brush head is free and clear to vacuum in tighter quarters.</p>
<h3>Edge cleaning</h3>
<p>We also tested the ability of these vacuums to pick up along the edge of a room or large furniture that goes to the floor. The Apex was a clear winner on this test, with good pickup right to a half-inch from a baseboard. The other finalists all left a track of dirt more than an inch wide.</p>
<h3>Attachments and Hose Length</h3>
<p>Our testers rated the usefulness of attachments for tricky situations like stairs, couches and drapes. Shark is almost cheating on this score, since the lift-away design means you can attach the handle directly to the motorized brush head to easily vacuum stairs, but the Shark vacuums include useful tools in other respects, too.</p>
<p>Of note is the motorized hand-sized upholstery brush included with the Apex. This kind of tool only works with vacuums that send power through the hose, so it&#8217;s pretty unique on a vacuum that doesn&#8217;t cost $600.</p>
<p>Hose length was a tricky feature to analyze: If you need to vacuum over and under a big sectional couch, for example, it might make all the difference. But the stand-out winner in this category, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAGRRRU/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2</a>, had the hose storage system that was most annoying to work with. Dyson stores a rigid extension tube inside the hose, and it all nestles into the handle shaft, but getting the parts to click into place after use was difficult.</p>
<p>The Shark’s short hose length lost the most points with our testers. The hose on the Apex is only half the length of Dyson&#8217;s incredible ten-foot reach. It&#8217;s easy to lift the Apex&#8217;s body with one hand if you&#8217;re standing on a stepladder to reach a ceiling, but if you&#8217;re going to use the hose frequently you might start looking at the after-market hose extensions offered by other companies.</p>
<h3>Pick-up performance</h3>

[table id=243 /]
<p>We ran ten different tests to determine performance on various kinds of carpet and with different types of dirt. We weighed samples of icing sugar, sand and circle-shaped cereal and tested how much each vacuum left behind in a single pass on short-, medium- and long-pile carpet.</p>
<p>The stand-out performance in the pickup tests came from Dyson. If you&#8217;ve got medium- or low-pile carpet and want a deep clean, Dyson does a great job. In those cases it left behind mere grams of material. That said, in long carpet fibers, Dyson offers no height or power adjustment to keep it from simply getting stuck. If you&#8217;ve got luxurious carpet or area rugs, count Dyson out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark&#8217;s Navigator</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> were nearly tied for how much they picked up on shorter carpet. We were especially impressed with the performance of the Dirt Devil, given how inexpensive and light it is.</p>

<p>The real winner for overall usefulness was the Shark &#8211; Apex. While the Navigator and Dirt Devil performed acceptably well on long carpet in their bare-floor modes, the Apex is the only vacuum in this lineup to offer real suction or brush speed control.</p>

This is the only upright that didn't struggle on area rugs and high-pile carpet.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Dyson and Eureka designs (despite the &#8220;height control&#8221; setting on the Eureka) were impossible to use effectively on long carpet. These vacuums try to gobble up the long fibers with the brushrolls on, and all the suction power pulls the vacuum down into the carpet so you can&#8217;t move.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s even worse if your plush carpet is a small area rug: With a vacuum like the Dyson, you&#8217;ll just get totally stuck or even damage your rug when it gets pulled part-way inside the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Filtration and sealing against dust escape</h3>
[table id=245 /]
<p>For a real test of the filter performance, we used a Dylos air-quality meter to measure particle counts in particles per million by volume, measuring half-micron particles and ten micron particles separately but averaged together here. Readings were taken before and after a vacuuming session, as well as after an additional five minutes running the vacuum to allow its filter to capture particles that had been thrown around.</p>
<p>Sealed-system vacuums performed better than the budget-priced models, though we were impressed at how well the Shark &#8211; Navigator kept up with the more expensive competition, even spreading less dust than its bigger sibling.</p>
<p>The Eureka turned in an impressive result if you only look at the improvement from running the vacuum for five minutes after you finish using it; the amount of dust it spat into the air while it was vacuuming, though, was by far the highest.</p>
<p>These results show that even a well-sealed vacuum that has a good filter will still kick up a lot of dust. <strong>Dust will settle naturally, but it takes a while. You should always vacuum the day before you have asthmatic friends over, not immediately before they arrive.</strong></p>
<p>In our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/">pet vacuum review</a> we saw comparable performance capturing smells. The sealed vacuums also performed well keeping pet dander and even odors inside the receptacle. The Eureka performed surprisingly well here capturing dust, much better than it did capturing smells, but there&#8217;s definitely enough variability in our testing environment and the way dust circulates in a room to account for that.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to keep your air as clean as possible, Shark and Dyson do a good job of keeping dust contained. Check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">review of the best room air purifiers</a> if you want to get dust levels even lower than this after you&#8217;re done vacuuming.</p>
<h3>Noise</h3>
[table id=244 /]
<p>After we collected all of the test data on effective cleaning, we booted up our audio-analysis rig to get some noise readings. We used a calibrated mic and the Room Eq Wizard software, set to measure decibels with A-scale weighting.</p>
<p>We took noise measurements from six feet away in a single-car garage bay with a concrete floor. That&#8217;s about double the distance you&#8217;d be at when using the vacuum. We also included two other test vacuums: The tester&#8217;s old Dyson &#8211; DC25 (purchased in 2013) along with the Shark &#8211; Rocket stick vacuum, which won top place in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a>.</p>
<p>The average noise level is quite loud, 85 dBA for just a vacuum motor or 89 with the brushroll engaged and picking up dirt on a hard surface. These vacuums move a lot of air very quickly, so noise is inevitable. For the louder machines, these levels are actually close to what we got in tests from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">review of electric leaf blowers</a>.</p>
<p>The difference between the quietest and loudest vacuum was a full 10 dBA. Because of how sound works, people will perceive that as only double the loudness, but it&#8217;s the same power increase as running nine more of the quietest vacuums in a room together.</p>
<p>The quietest vacuum was the Shark &#8211; Apex, also the most expensive vacuum we tested. <strong>The cheaper Shark &#8211; Navigator was only 1dBA louder, with both vacuums peaking under 87 dBA with the brushroll turned on.</strong> That&#8217;s still loud enough that <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2016/02/08/noise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to guidelines set by the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety</a>, you shouldn&#8217;t be up-close with these vacuum cleaners for more than an hour every day without hearing protection.</p>
<p>All of the other vacuums we tested (including the stick vacuum) were louder than 85 dBA from six feet away. From close-up, as you&#8217;d be using them, the loudest vacuums measured at 97 dBA. You shouldn&#8217;t use a loud vacuum cleaner for longer than half an hour every day without some ear plugs.</p>
<p>This is still much quieter than the noise exposure from power tools at a jobsite, but it&#8217;s something to keep in mind. If you clean for a living and need some hearing protection, check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-ear-plugs/">review of the best ear plugs.</a> Obviously, any of these vacuums are loud enough to wake most roommates (not to mention a baby).</p>
<p>One notable quirk is that while the Dyson is loud overall, its brushroll motor hardly adds any extra noise. Shark&#8217;s powerful brushrolls are quiet, but you can definitely tell when they&#8217;re turned on and off.</p>

<p>At just over $300 from most retailers, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex AZ1002</a> is a premium product that really works to justify the extra cost. This is Shark&#8217;s largest vacuum, and it includes all of the best toys: powered accessory tools, a wood-floor-friendly brushroll, a hair-proof brush cleaning system, an extra-long cord and some working carpet-height settings.</p>
<p>This is the biggest vacuum we tested, though it actually has a fairly narrow cleaning track at 11.5 inches. Compare that to 12 inches on the budget-friendly Dirt Devil or 13.4 inches on the smaller-sized Dyson we tested. Shark tends to focus on maneuverability and flexibility instead of a wide pickup path, and we&#8217;re pretty happy with that tradeoff.</p>
<p>At 16 pounds and drawing 1350 watts of power, the Apex definitely feels like a full-size vacuum when you first assemble it. Most impressive are the power and floor-surface control switches that are mounted on the handle for easy access. No more bending down just to pause to answer the door or move from carpet to hard flooring.</p>
<p>We also noticed the DuoClean brush rollers pulling the Apex across floors more briskly than other uprights. Thankfully, the quick-swiveling head is easy to steer, so we never felt like this was a runaway vacuum. It&#8217;s power you can feel, but you&#8217;re in control.</p>
<h3>Best for thick carpet</h3>
<p>Thick carpet is where this vacuum really shone. Some of the other machines could get you by if you turn off the brushroll to keep it from jamming up, but the Apex gives you just the right amount of suction and brush speed to move swiftly across the floor and effectively clean your carpet.</p>
<p>In our test picking up icing sugar, the Apex was only 20 percent better than the Dyson on long carpet. With sand, though, that difference jumped to an astounding 43 percent. The Apex was also the only upright to earn a perfect score picking up large objects, though the Dirt Devil was not far behind.</p>
<h3>Powered lift-away design</h3>

<p>Shark&#8217;s trademark design innovation is that they don&#8217;t let upright vacuums just be uprights: most of their line also converts to something more like a canister system, with the motor and dust cup in a &#8220;Lift-Away&#8221; pod that detaches from the handle tube.</p>
<p>The Lift-Away design makes the vacuum more flexible than a simple hand tool plugged into a hose could ever be. As mentioned above, since this is a powered Lift-Away model you can use the full-size brush head under furniture, and if you&#8217;re vacuuming a small area with lots of obstacles you can shed all the motor weight for more agility.</p>
<p>The downside of Shark&#8217;s Lift-Away designs has always been short hoses. You run out of hose very quickly if you try to use the Apex like a canister vacuum with the motor unit on the floor, so if you&#8217;re vacuuming a whole room with lots of furniture to clean under you&#8217;ll probably wind up carrying it in one hand while you vacuum with the other.</p>
<p>You can buy a wheeled cart for the canister, and there are non-powered hose extensions you can try, but most of the time it just makes far more sense to use the Apex in its upright mode.</p>
<p>Having too much extra hose can be annoying, and even Dyson&#8217;s remarkable collapsing hose is a bit unwieldy. Maybe there&#8217;s no perfect two-in-one canister and upright vacuum, but we really would like to see at least another three feet on the Apex to say it&#8217;s worth considering as a canister-mode design. For stairs and upholstery, though, it&#8217;s fantastic.</p>
<h3>Also the best upright vacuum for hardwood floors</h3>

<p>The Apex isn&#8217;t a one-trick fish, though. As well as tackling plush carpet, this is the best upright vacuum for bare floors. The Apex brings a few features to bear that you should consider if you&#8217;re vacuuming a hardwood floor rather than wall-to-wall carpet.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s Shark&#8217;s DuoClean brushroll. Many hardwood experts don&#8217;t like using a brushroll anywhere near hardwood, and you could use a vacuum that just has a simple easy-gliding suction head. (You could also use a dust mop.) <strong>But the DuoClean system is an exceptionally soft brush, and it works well to dust and even slightly polish your hardwood or manufactured flooring.</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got sand on your floor, it&#8217;s better to pick it up without grinding it in at all, but most of the time you encounter grains of sand on your floor you won&#8217;t know until you see a scratch. The Apex is, at least, designed to minimize the damage.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shark-ApexCTA.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top of the Food Chain: Shark - Apex</h3><p>Shark's vacuums are incredibly popular, and this model includes basically every feature they've come up with. Great control means this is actually a good vacuum on all surfaces, and the powered lift-away system makes it very flexible. To top it all off, this is quiet and captures dust effectively.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Another reason this is the best upright vacuum for hardwood floors is that it won&#8217;t choke on your area rugs. None of the other vacuums we looked at in this price range have controls for switching surfaces, so this is the vacuum that does the whole room at once.</p>
<p>We need to stop for a moment here and emphasize that if you&#8217;ve got a new engineered hardwood floor, you should double-check with the manufacturer that use of a soft brushroll won&#8217;t void your warranty. Flooring finishes should all be fine, but care instructions sometimes specifically say not to use a buffing machine or a &#8220;beater bar&#8221; head.</p>
<p>Again, we haven&#8217;t seen any evidence that this vacuum could damage a floor unless you&#8217;re running it through piles of sand and deliberately grinding it into your hardwood.</p>

<p>Shark sells the Apex in a few different versions, but we tested the version that had the best set of accessories, the AZ1002. This model ships with three compact attachments you can plug into the end of the hose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, motorized brush head</li>
<li>12-inch crevice tool</li>
<li>Combination upholstery brush &amp; mattress tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Also remember that the extension tube and the full-size head will plug into the handle, so you can get about 30 inches of extra reach with any of these tools for dusting high-up corners and drapes.</p>
<p>Shark sometimes runs promotions that will include extra accessories, like a flat-surface or under-furniture dusting tool, if you purchase directly from their site.</p>
<p>The motorized pet tool is a good pick if you&#8217;ve got corduroy upholstery or other surfaces that collect hair and need more than just suction to clean. It probably wouldn&#8217;t be worth picking this tool up all by itself if you buy the Apex without it, but it&#8217;s a nice perk and stores neatly on the base of the vacuum.</p>
<p>For stairs and other tricky carpeted surfaces, we think that plugging the handle directly into the regular carpet head and using the Apex like a super-powered handheld vacuum is a fantastic trick. If you&#8217;ve ever skipped cleaning carpeted stairs because you hate how clunky your vacuum is, you&#8217;ll love the Apex.</p>
<h3>Sealed system and HEPA Filter</h3>
<p>The Apex performed very well in our dust collection test. Any powered-brush vacuum will kick dust into the air, so don&#8217;t count on the Apex to make your air dust-free immediately after vacuuming, but the sealed system and HEPA filter will make sure that it&#8217;s not just blowing all the dust you pick up back out into your room.</p>
<h3>A bigger, better vacuum</h3>
<p>To sum up all our time with the Apex: this is a big vacuum that&#8217;s not clunky. Shark has some great tricks that make this a more versatile system than any other vacuum we found. If you have long carpet, area rugs, or any other tasks that utilize Shark&#8217;s special features it&#8217;s an easy vacuum to recommend.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re only vacuuming medium-length carpet, though, both the Shark &#8211; Navigator and the Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet will also do a good job. Those vacuums are lighter, so they&#8217;re easier to use, and they&#8217;re much less expensive, too.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> is a big vacuum, but it’s still easy to handle.</li>
<li>On long carpet, the Apex easily beat all competitors.</li>
<li>This doesn’t quite have as much cleaning power as a Dyson on medium carpets.</li>
<li>Shark&#8217;s powered lift-away design gives flexibility.</li>
<li>Good sealing and filtration keeps dust to a minimum.</li>
<li>The DuoClean brushroll design is also good for hardwood floors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-value">Best Value: Shark &#8211; Navigator</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator NV352</a> earned a second-place ranking based on performance in our tests, but when you consider that it&#8217;s only half the price of the more expensive vacuums we bought, there&#8217;s plenty of reason to consider it best value overall.</p>
<p>The Navigator is a consistent winner in vacuum tests all over the internet. This is a step up from the cheapest vacuums that Shark makes, and a clear step down from their full-featured models. The NV352 doesn&#8217;t have the new hardwood-polishing soft brush, and the version with Shark&#8217;s new maintenance-free &#8220;ZeroM&#8221; brushroll is about $50 more. The lift-away mode won&#8217;t run the brushroll, and there&#8217;s no suction or speed control to make long carpets bearable.</p>
<p>That said, on mid- or short-length carpet this vacuum almost keeps up with a $300 Dyson in our pickup tests for sand and powder.</p>
<p>This is our pick for those whose biggest concern is pet hair pickup, so long as you don&#8217;t have longer carpet. If you do have high-pile carpet, this isn&#8217;t the worst-performing vacuum if you turn the brushroll off, but it&#8217;s not nearly as good as a machine with real multi-surface controls.</p>
<p>Just like the Apex, the Navigator beat the Dyson in both air quality and noise-output tests. It&#8217;s nice to know that for a value-priced vacuum, you don&#8217;t have to make compromises when it comes to your health.</p>

This isn't the very best in any one category, but it's got a strong motor and it's still easy to handle.

<p>If you&#8217;re vacuuming on low-pile carpet or bare floors, the Navigator did spray more sand than the Apex or Dyson. If you spot a pile of sand, you should always turn off the brushroll anyhow, but the Navigator seems to have an extra-aggressive brush.</p>
<h3>Shortcomings</h3>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cerealpickup.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>As you can see in the clip above, the Navigator had trouble in the cereal pickup test, especially on medium carpet. Even on short carpet, where it performed much better, there was a straggler.</p>
<p>In our maneuverability tests the Navigator easily beat the Dyson, but it&#8217;s not as easy to steer as the Dirt Devil. When we asked our tester which vacuum she would most like to keep for her apartment, she passed up the Navigator&#8217;s air filtration and power for the most maneuverable choice.</p>
<p>All in all, there are a few ways the Apex is clearly a better vacuum. The Navigator keeps pace, though, and actually outperformed the Apex in some tests. For most people, this will be a great vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a> is a tried and true value pick.</li>
<li>If your biggest concern is pet hair on mid-length carpet, get this.</li>
<li>Even the less-expensive Shark filters exhaust air even better than Dyson.</li>
<li>The Navigator is almost as quiet as the Apex.</li>
<li>A non-powered lift-away design makes this less flexible than the Apex.</li>

<p>Dirt Devil&#8217;s lineup of vacuums is very much focused on the budget segment of the market, with few models crossing the $100 threshold. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Razor Pet Steerable Upright</a> is the upgraded model with swivel-action steering, and we think it&#8217;s a great vacuum if your budget is tight.</p>
<p>The Dirt Devil kept pace with the Navigator through the low- and mid-pile carpet tests, so it&#8217;s a vacuum that&#8217;s capable of thoroughly cleaning your carpet. But where it really stood out was in handling. The Dirt Devil is actually slightly heavier than the Navigator, but it&#8217;s easier to maneuver and wheel around.</p>
<p>This vacuum also fits under furniture with a clearance height just slightly lower than the Apex&#8217;s. Without the lift-away feature this isn&#8217;t as versatile in some tight spots, but there&#8217;s something great about a vacuum that&#8217;s just good at what it was built for.</p>

The Razor keeps up admirably on most carpet, and it's pretty good at dust control.

<p>For dust control, this vacuum doesn&#8217;t have a HEPA filter or a fully sealed system. It will spread more fine dust around than the Shark or Dyson vacuums. That said, it was surprisingly good at containing the smell and dust from pet hair in one tester&#8217;s apartment. It&#8217;s also slightly quieter than a Dyson.</p>

<p>Dirt Devil includes an air-turbine-powered hand tool with this package, and it&#8217;s the kind of tool that might help in a very few situations, but for the most part you&#8217;ll probably skip it. The Shark&#8217;s motorized brush is wider, and actually has enough torque to get dirt out of carpet or upholstery fibers.</p>
<p>Dirt devil also includes a two-in-one crevice and brush tool for capturing loose objects that fall out of your pockets into your couch. The tools are friction-fit, instead of snapping in place, but they work about as well as most cheap vacuum accessories and store neatly on the side of the vacuum.</p>
<p>One of our testers advocated for a second-place ranking for this vacuum. If you&#8217;ve got a small apartment or a limited area of carpet to clean, this is a vacuum that will get the job done without any pretentious extra features.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; Razor Pet</a> is an easy-to-steer upright vacuum.</li>
<li>If you need competitive cleaning power on a tight budget, here it is.</li>
<li>A low-profile head makes this easier to get under furniture.</li>
<li>The Razor&#8217;s filter and noise reduction won&#8217;t beat Shark, but it keeps up with Dyson.</li>

<p>The Dyson &#8211; Ball Multi Floor 2 is a powerful vacuum with some great design details, but after spending time with all of the vacuums in this lineup, none of our testers really liked using it.</p>
<p>Dyson products are often tricky to review. When Dyson does something well, they usually do it very well. James Dyson revolutionized vacuum cleaners and has been a dominant force since the DC07 was released in 2001. That said, Dyson has never been very competitive with price, and there are some things about this vacuum that are nearly unforgivable.</p>
<p>At about $300, the Ball Multi Floor 2 is a solid performer. We don&#8217;t want to misrepresent the performance numbers: this is clearly the best vacuum for low-pile carpet if all you care about is deep-cleaning. The track is wide, and the suction and agitation get more dirt out —  on average, the Dyson picked up 95 percent of our test samples on carpets where it will actually move effectively.</p>
<p>Dyson also makes an even more expensive vacuum, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the Multi Floor 2&#8217;s biggest problem. The Ball Animal 2 is supposed to have even more power, but if you have high-pile carpet or area rugs that&#8217;s just like throwing gasoline on a fire. Dyson does not design these vacuums for people with multiple floor surfaces.</p>
<p>The Dyson is a few pounds lighter than the Shark &#8211; Apex, but despite all the ingenuity of the rolling-ball design, this is a difficult vacuum to push around and maneuver. Compared to clunky old commercial vacuums from forty years ago the ball is a great idea, but the new swivel-head competitors are much easier to use. Again, the upgrade model from Dyson would just make the problem worse with a bigger and heavier body.</p>
<p>This might be the best upright vacuum for tile floors, since the hard brushroll doesn&#8217;t matter the way it does on hardwood, and the most important feature is suction power in that case. But it&#8217;s clear that any of the choices from our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-steam-mop/">steam mop review</a> would be a better tool for cleaning tile floors.</p>

<p>One strange quirk of the new Ball 2 design that you won&#8217;t see in promotional pictures or even most video reviews is the pressure relief vent at the top of the handle.</p>
<p>When you finish vacuuming and push the Dyson up into its standing mode, the suction switches from the brush head to the handle-mounted extension hose automatically. Air starts rushing in through the cap at the top of the handle.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a bit scary if your hand is on top of the handle when you push it into the standing mode, and it&#8217;s not something we&#8217;d seen on the other Dyson vacuums we&#8217;ve used.</strong> You&#8217;re not going to lose a finger or anything, but it was a turn-off for our testers.</p>
<p>In 2018, Dyson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/06/dyson-announces-cordless-future-with-end-of-plug-in-vacuums" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that they&#8217;re no longer developing</a> new plug-in vacuum designs. We chose their V8 cordless stick vacuum as a top pick in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">stick vacuum review</a>, so we know they&#8217;re on to something, but there are good reasons for many of us to own a conventional upright.</p>
<p>It seems like Dyson never got further than designing around great suction and long hoses. If that&#8217;s your primary concern, then this model or the even more powerful Animal 2 will beat most other vacuums. If you want a vacuum that&#8217;s easy to push and works on other surfaces than low-pile carpet, we suggest looking elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; PowerSpeed NEU180B Upright</a> isn&#8217;t a terrible vacuum. It has good reviews on the retail websites we looked at, with a 4.4 average on Amazon and a good Fakespot grade, as well, so we don&#8217;t suspect those are disingenuous reviews. Many of them seem to be cat owners, so it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re just easy to please.</p>
<p>But about the best thing we can say about the Eureka, in comparison to the other models we tested, is that it&#8217;s very light. Compared to the Dirt Devil at the same price, or the Shark &#8211; Navigator for about $60 more, it&#8217;s just not at all competitive. Not in pickup, not in maneuverability, not in ease of use, not in noise. It doesn&#8217;t even fit under furniture well.</p>
<p>The Eureka is worthless on long carpet. No, a Dyson isn&#8217;t much better, but that&#8217;s not a good excuse when you advertise &#8220;five height-adjustment settings.&#8221; It turns out that the setting just opens or closes the suction opening at the floor very slightly and directs it away from the brushroll. This vacuum did not work on area rugs or carpet with any kind of long pile.</p>

<p>Upright vacuums are tricky beasts. Just about any upright will do a decent job of getting everyday dirt out of low-pile carpet, and so picking the very best means testing for the most extreme cases. It also means we had to be a little bit more picky about likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>After testing vacuums in a variety of real-world settings and comparing them side-by-side in controlled tests, it&#8217;s clear that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FX5PCMN/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Apex</a> is the vacuum to beat. Good performance on every surface was definitely a winning trait, and creature comforts like handle-mounted switches didn&#8217;t hurt. The powered lift-away design isn&#8217;t everything that a canister vacuum would be, but it&#8217;s pretty darn close for a two-in-one design.</p>
<p>Even with a runner-up pick, it&#8217;s hard not to feel like we&#8217;re short-changing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdupvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; Navigator</a>. It&#8217;s small and light, but it packs a lot of power into that compact frame. This value-friendly model is still dust-sealed and quiet, but it doesn&#8217;t have multi-surface power settings or run the brush head in lift-away mode.</p>

<h2 id="standards">Pet food standards</h2>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) works hand-in-hand with the <a href="https://www.aafco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association of American Feed Control Officials</a> (AAFCO) in regulating pet food standards. The AAFCO is a voluntary membership organization of local, state and federal agencies who regulate the sale and distribution of animal feed and pet food.</p>
<p>The AAFCO’s panel of scientists, veterinarians and experts on animal nutrition devised industry-wide standards for the ingredients used in manufacturing pet foods. For any pet food to be deemed certified by the AAFCO, ingredients must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Species appropriate</li>
<li>Proven safe</li>
<li>Nutritionally adequate</li>
</ul>
<p>Together with the AAFCO, the FDA enforces the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/Products/AnimalFoodFeeds/IngredientsAdditives/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required labeling of pet foods</a>. All pet foods must be labeled with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingredients</li>
<li>Manufacturer’s name and address</li>
<li>Guaranteed analysis (such as protein, fiber, fat, etc.)</li>
<li>Nutritional adequacy statement</li>
<li>Feeding directions</li>
<li>Calorie statement</li>
</ul>
<p>A manufacturer of dog food must comply with the FDA’s regulations to sell their product. As long as the manufacturer follows the rules for labeling, they are free to add virtually any ingredient to their dog food.</p>
<h2 id="dogs-need">What do dogs need in their diet?</h2>
<p>As with humans, a dog’s diet is the foundation of good health. There are foods that can heal a dog, foods that harm a dog, and foods that do both. A frequent term used by veterinarians is “species appropriate,” which means the type of food the animal consumes in the wild. Since dogs and wolves share 99.9% of DNA, a species appropriate diet for a dog would be similar to a wolf’s diet: high protein, high moisture and low carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Although it’s popular to think a dog is omnivorous — and it certainly does seem like they eat anything — they have not evolved from their carnivorous origins. Dogs require meat in their diet, despite the fad of feeding them just vegetables and whole grains. Their digestive system breaks down raw meat, bone, offal and fur into nutrients and then passes waste material quickly.</p>
<p>We’re not advocating feeding bones, internal organs and fur to your dog, but the nutrients these body parts supply should be integrated in your dog’s diet. Reputable dog food manufacturers strive to make foods that meet your dog’s nutritional needs. There are, however, many dog food manufacturers — household names, no less — that plump up their product with unnamed meats, bulky grains and additives to save costs.</p>
<h3>Changing your dog’s food</h3>
<p>Conventional wisdom is that you should never change a dog’s food. According to veterinarian <a href="https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/dr-karen-becker.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Karen Becker</a>, that’s like being told as a child that the only thing you can eat for the rest of your life is oatmeal.</p>
<p>In the wild, canines have a smorgasbord of foods at their disposal, so if you’ve been feeding your dog the same canned and/or dry food for years, there’s a good chance that he/she is bored with it. A quick change, however, may cause digestive distress. There’s <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/how-often-should-i-change-foods.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a definite procedure</a> for changing your dog’s diet, but it will be nutritionally beneficial for him/her to switch foods periodically.</p>
<h3>Grain-free diet</h3>
<p>No doubt you see a lot of savvy marketing for “grain-free” dog foods. It’s true that grains add unnecessary carbohydrates, but as dogs evolved, their digestive systems adapted to processing grains. (The exception is whole ground corn, which is difficult for dogs to digest and process.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thisdogslife.co/10-breeds-prone-allergies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some breeds</a>, however, have a genetic predilection for gluten and other food allergies, so a grain-free diet is necessary for them to thrive.</p>
<p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/newsevents/cvmupdates/ucm613305.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FDA launched a study</a> into possible links between grain-free diets and canine heart disease. Removing grains from pet foods eliminates taurine, an important amino acid for both cats and dogs. The Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association reports that the FDA’s study is not just focused on grain-free diets, however, but also on the possible detrimental effects of replacing grains with legumes.</p>
<p>Jme Thomas is the Executive Director of <a href="https://www.motleyzooanimalrescue.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motley Zoo Animal Rescue</a>, and she advises that since the FDA’s study has caused some concern in the pet industry, you might consider feeding your dog a food that has small amounts of grain. However, If your dog is allergic to grain, then it’s best to simply add a taurine supplement to his/her food.</p>
<h2 id="how-made">How dog food is made</h2>
<h3>Canned</h3>
<p>The primary ingredients of canned dog food are fresh meat and meat by-products, which include the cleaned carcass and internal organs of the slaughtered animal. The meat is frozen and either cut into chunks or ground. It is then steamed in water or broth, and the cooked meat is then combined with other ingredients, such as vegetables, grains, vitamins and minerals. A starch or thickener is added to gel the mixture together. The mixture is packed into individual cans, vacuum-sealed and sterilized in a heating chamber.</p>
<h3>Dry food</h3>
<p>Fresh or frozen meat and meat by-products are combined with ground grains, fats, vitamins, minerals and meals derived from ground bone or ground dehydrated meat or meat by-products. This mixture, resembling bread dough, is forced through an extruder, which cooks and cuts it into shapes. The pieces are then oven-dried, cooled and sprayed with flavor enhancers and preservatives.</p>
<h3>Freeze-dried</h3>
<p>Cut raw meat is placed inside a vacuum chamber, which freezes the meat solid. The chamber’s temperature is gradually increased and pressurized. The meat’s frozen internal liquid converts to vapor and is extracted. Freeze-dried food may be fed as is or rehydrated.</p>
<h3>Dehydrated</h3>
<p>Conversely, dehydration involves a heat process of removing moisture from meat. Low heat is slowly applied to the raw product until it is completely dried. Dehydrated foods must be rehydrated before feeding.</p>
<h2 id="package">Packaging and labeling</h2>
<p>Since dog food is marketed to owners and not their dogs, most of the manufacturer’s deception and specious claims are found on the product’s packaging.</p>
<p>The majority of dog food packaging — if not all of it —is plastered with bright and bold colors and mouth-watering photographs of roasted or raw meats and vegetables, sometimes ladled with gravy or cross-hatched with barbecue grill marks. These enticing images are obviously intended to draw your eyes to the packaging.</p>
<p>Next, the manufacturer will grab you with marketing catch phrases on the bag or can, such as “increases vitality,” “vibrant maturity,” or “proactive health.” Also you’ll see “premium,” “super-premium” and “ultra-premium.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no set standards for using these phrases, and a company will label their product to appeal to the consumer’s emotions and conscience. Although there are dog food manufacturers who are indeed using higher-quality ingredients, others are simply marking up the price of their product for the inclusion of ingredients that have no proven higher nutritional value.</p>
<h3>AAFCO labeling rules</h3>
<p>The FDA and AAFCO cannot enforce truth in advertising. However, dog food manufacturers are required to use specific wording for the percentages of meat in their products. Below are the standardized phrases and their definitions as dictated by the AAFCO.</p>
<p><b>95-percent rule: </b>Ninety-five percent — not including the water added for processing —  of the product must be the named ingredient, for example, beef or chicken. If the water is counted in the total percentage, then the named ingredient must comprise 70-percent of the total. If the name includes two ingredients —  for example, “Beef ‘n Liver Dog Food” — they must comprise 95% of the total weight with the first ingredient listed having predominance.</p>
<p><b>25-percent or “dinner” rule: </b>If the named ingredients comprise at least 25% of the product (not including water for processing), it must be labeled as “dinner. For example, ‘Beef Dinner for Dogs” must only contain at least 25% of beef in the total weight of the product. If two ingredients are listed, like “Beef ‘n Liver Dinner,” the second named ingredient must weigh only 3% of the total.</p>
<p><b>3-percent or “with” rule: </b>This rule was originally created for advertising the inclusion of a minor ingredient, such as cheese, in the food. The AAFCO has modified the rule so that the word <b>“with”</b> indicates that 3% of the ingredient comprises the total weight. So for example, “Dog Food With Beef” means there is only 3% beef total in the food.</p>
<p><b>Flavor: </b>No percentage is required for this word to be used, but it must contain an amount that is detectable. “Beef Flavor Dog Food” may have beef as an ingredient, but more than likely it is beef meal, beef by-products or a “digest,” a concentrated flavor enhancer derived from the liquid of boiled-down meats.</p>
<p><b>Natural: </b>The AAFCO defines “natural” as meaning ingredients that are derived solely from animal, plant or mineral that have not been processed using chemicals or chemical additives. A product may be labeled as “100-percent natural” or “all-natural” only if it does not contain synthetic ingredients.</p>
<p><b>Organic: </b>The same requirements established by the <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/programs-offices/national-organic-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Agriculture </a>(USDA) for foods consumed by humans apply to dog foods. Ingredients must be produced by approved methods without synthetic fertilizers, irradiation or genetic engineering. The USDA does not consider organic foods to be necessarily healthier or more nutritious than conventionally produced foods.</p>
<h3>How to read the label</h3>
<p>Reading the label of the canned or dry food is the only way to really know whether it is the best food for your dog. The FDA enforces federal regulations for information that must be printed on every pet food label. Individual states may elect to follow the guidelines established by the AAFCO, which are more specific.</p>
<p>Each label should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper identification of the product</li>
<li>Proper listing of ingredients</li>
<li>Manufacturer’s name and address</li>
<li>Guaranteed analysis.</li>
<li>Feeding directions</li>
<li>Calorie statements</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>As we discussed in <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-dog-treats/">our best dog treat review</a>, the ingredients in pet foods are not always easily identifiable. However, the AAFCO’s standards and definitions will help you understand exactly what’s in the dog food you buy.</p>
<p>All ingredients are required to be listed in order by weight, and the primary ingredients (those with the most weight) will be the first four or five that are listed. Since dog food manufacturers know that you want to feed meat to your dog, in most cases meat will be the first ingredient listed.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, however, that the water needed to cook the meat in canned food is included in the weight. In canned food, water or broth for processing is often the second — hence, the second weightiest —  ingredient.</p>
<p>The same rule applies to dry food before processing. You might see chicken listed as the first ingredient, but once that chicken’s been cooked and its moisture (nearly 75% of the meat’s weight) has been removed, the chicken’s weight has been reduced to approximately 20%.</p>
<p>There are three types of meat that are used in canned and dry dog food.</p>
<p><b>Meat:</b> Defined as “the clean flesh of slaughtered mammals and is limited to muscle tissue attached to the skeleton by tendons with or without the accompanying and overlying fat and the portions of the skin, sinew, nerve and blood vessels which normally accompany the flesh.”</p>
<p>The species of animal from which the meat was harvested must also be identified. “Slaughtered mammals” is very broad and could include meat you would never consider feeding to your beloved pet.</p>
<p>A major controversy in the pet food industry is known as “4-D meat.” The FDA has strict laws for the use of raw 4-D meat — diseased, dying, down, dead — in pet foods. A significant number of veterinarians and pet food nutritionists don’t believe the FDA is able to fully enforce these laws with all suppliers of meat. They warn that pet food labeled “meat” or “animal” could be harmful to your pet’s health.</p>
<p>As a general rule, never purchase a pet food that does not identify the species of animal meat or meat by-products used.</p>
<p><b>Meat by-products:</b> Rendered animal parts deemed not suitable for human consumption. They include carcasses, internal organs, heads, feet, hair and unhatched eggs. Although by-products are not considered esthetically pleasing by many people, they are oftentimes safe and nutritious for dogs.</p>
<p><b>Meat meal and by-product meal: </b>Meat and meat by-products, including bone, from which fat and moisture have been removed. Bone meal is similar to meat and by-product meals, but it can include entire carcasses. Unlike meat and meat by-products, animals other than cattle, sheep and goats may be used without identification on the label.</p>
<h3>Ingredients to beware</h3>
<p>The following list are ingredients that are frequently added to canned and dry dog foods. Veterinarians and pet nutritionists warn that these ingredients should not be fed to your dog. Some of the ingredients can cause your dog immediate harm, while others could affect your dog&#8217;s health over the long term.</p>
<p><b>Generic animal fat: </b>If the animal fat isn’t identified on the label, you’ll have no idea from what species of animal the fat has been trimmed.</p>
<p><b>BHA and BHT:</b> Banned in most countries for potential links to cancer, these chemical preservatives are still added to certain dog foods in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p><b>Artificial coloring:</b> Red, blue and yellow dyes have been added to appeal visually to you; your dog won’t care.</p>
<p><b>Corn syrup, fructose and sucrose:  </b>These sugars and other sweeteners are added to make lower-grade ingredients taste better.</p>
<p><b>Xylitol: </b>A sugar substitute used in products like chewing gum, this is toxic to dogs.</p>
<p><b>Propylene glycol: </b>This is a chemical food additive notable for its use in &#8220;safe&#8221; antifreeze. It’s often used in semi-moist dry dog food as a humectant. Although <a href="https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/red-flag-ingredients/propylene-glycol-dog-food-aid-or-automotive-anti-freeze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">propylene glycol has been banned from cat food</a>, it’s still allowed in dog food (and for human consumption at low levels).</p>
<p><b>Ethoxyquin:</b> First created by Monsanto as a pesticide and a food preservative, ethoxyquin has been linked to cancer. Its use in human food is heavily restricted, but it’s used in dog foods as a preservative for fish and fish meal. A manufacturer of dog food is not required to list ethoxyquin on the label if fish or fish meal was purchased from a supplier outside of the U.S.</p>
<h3>Guaranteed analysis</h3>
<p>Manufacturers are required to list the minimum amount of crude protein and crude fat and maximum amount of crude fiber and moisture on all dog food labels. “Crude” does not refer to the quality of the nutrient but to the method of estimating the quantity of the nutrient.</p>
<p>These percentages, however, vastly differ between canned dog food and dry dog food. For example, canned dog food might have 12% minimum crude protein and dry dog food might have 36%. You would assume the dry food is higher in protein than the canned food. In actuality, that’s not accurate.</p>
<p>Canned food has quadruple the amount of moisture of dry food, and so to make a meaningful calculation of nutrients, the FDA advises using the <a href="https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/choosing-dog-food/dry-matter-basis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“dry matter basis.”</a> This may seem overly complex, but it’s easy to do and the only way of determining how nutritious a canned or dry food is.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Step 1: </b>Subtract the percentage of moisture listed on the canned food’s label from 100. As an example, the label on the canned food lists moisture as 72%. Subtract 72 from 100, leaving you with 28. This is now the percentage of dry matter in the canned food.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b>Divide the percentage of protein listed on the label — in our example, 12% — by the dry matter. So 12 divided by 28 equals (rounded off) .43.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b>Multiply that result by 100, and this will now give you the actual percentage of protein in the canned food.</p></blockquote>
<p>Repeat the calculation with the dry food, and compare them side by side. You now have an accurate representation of how much protein each contains.</p>
<h3>Nutritional adequacy statement</h3>
<p>Any dog food manufacturer that claims its product is “complete and balanced” must be labeled with the AAFCO nutritional adequacy statement. The food has been tested using AAFCO Feeding Trial Protocols under strict guidelines.</p>
<p>On the label, look for the following wording:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“&#8230;formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrition Profiles for All Life Stages.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>If you don’t see the AAFCO’s nutritional adequacy statement, the product has not met the AAFCO’s stringent standards.</p>
<h3>“Made in the USA”</h3>
<p>By the Federal Trade Commission’s definition, “made in the USA” means that all or virtually all of a product has been made in the U.S. The FTC is less strict, however, about pet foods. A manufacturer of dog food may indeed process its product in the U.S., but it may source ingredients outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>In 2007, melamine in wheat gluten imported from China and used in canned dog food resulted in thousands of canine deaths. The FDA issued a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/safetyhealth/recallswithdrawals/ucm129932.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recall of all the pet foods</a> made in the U.S. that used the imported wheat gluten. Currently the FDA is still investigating and studying what happened but has yet to issue regulations for importation of ingredients used in the manufacture of pet food.</p>
<p>The best you can do to ensure that the dog food you buy is made with U.S.-sourced ingredients is check whether the company has taken the <a href="https://associationfortruthinpetfood.com/the-pledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association for Truth in Pet Food’s Pledge to Quality and Origin of Ingredients</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-best">What makes the best dog food?</h2>
<h3>Canned</h3>
<p><b>The primary ingredients are an identified whole meat:</b> The first ingredient should be an identified whole meat. The second ingredient is usually water or broth for processing. (Some of the canned foods we researched actually had water as the first ingredient.) The third ingredient should also be another identified whole meat or meat meal.  If you see brown rice, white rice, corn or barley as the third ingredient, that&#8217;s too much filler that will add carbohydrates.</p>
<p><b>Whole unprocessed vegetables and limited grains: </b>The nutrients, vitamins and antioxidants of whole foods will survive processing better than ground grains and vegetables. For example, “peas” are more nutritious than “pea flour.”</p>
<p><b>High protein, high moisture, low carbohydrates:</b> The AAFCO recommends a minimum of 22.5% protein and a minimum of 8.5% fat for puppies, and a minimum of 18% protein and 5.5% fat for adult dogs. The AAFCO does not measure carbohydrates, but estimates them by calculating other components, including crude fiber.</p>
<p><b>AAFCO nutritional statement: </b>Look for a statement on the can’s label that the food “provides complete and balanced nutrition for all life stages.”</p>
<h3>Dry dog food</h3>
<p><b>The first three ingredients are an identified whole meat: </b>Manufacturers know that you want to feed meat to your dog, so it will be listed first. If you see “chicken,” that’s great. Remember that the chicken loses up to 75% of its weight during processing. So the second ingredient should be another identified whole meat, and the third ingredient should be meat or a meat meal.</p>
<p><b>Whole vegetables and limited whole grains: </b>Whole vegetables and grains will retain more nutritional value than vegetable or grain flours during processing. Grains add carbohydrates, so look for dry foods that have grains lower on the list of ingredients.</p>
<p><b>Appropriate protein-to-fat ratio: </b>The percentages of protein to fat are dependent on your dog’s age and weight. The AAFCO recommends a daily consumption for a healthy adult dog as a minimum of 18% protein and 5.5% fat. The best dry dog foods we researched overall had a 2.5-to-1 protein-to-fat ratio.</p>
<p><b>AAFCO nutritional statement: </b>“Provides complete and balanced nutrition for all life stages” should be on the food’s label.</p>

<p>Our recommendations for best canned dog food are based on research and the analysis of twenty-three products that can be purchased at grocery stores, pet supply stores and online. We’ve consulted veterinarians and pet food nutrition experts for their opinions about what criteria canned dog food should meet to be considered exceptional.</p>
<p>Castor &amp; Pollux has several blends of their excellent canned dog foods. The Butcher &amp; Bushel blends are predominantly organic meats with whole vegetables and use less water and broth for processing than their other Organix recipes.</p>
<p>Castor &amp; Pollux’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Organix-Butcher-Organic-Carrots-Potatoes/dp/B00DQR8TXO/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chopped Turkey and Chicken Dinner</a> is high in protein and moisture and low in carbohydrates, which is exactly what you want in a canine food. Primary ingredients are meat: organic turkey, organic chicken and organic chicken liver. Peas, potatoes and blueberries are the vegetables and fruit. There’s also some flaxseed, which is a rich source of healthy fat and antioxidants.</p>

<p>The Castor &amp; Pollux Organix brand is USDA-certified 100% organic and verified by The Non-GMO Project as produced in accordance with best practices for GM avoidance. It also bears the AAFCO nutritional statement on the label.</p>
<p>There are three more grain-free Organix Butcher &amp; Bushel recipes: Chicken Wing and Thigh (which actually has chicken bone attached to the meat), Carved Turkey Dinner and Shredded Chicken Dinner. All of the Butcher &amp; Bushel recipes have an abundance of meat in the first four ingredients. The regular Organix recipes and other grain-free recipe have more brown rice or starchy vegetables as primary ingredients.</p>
<p>Using the dry basis method, the Organix Chopped Turkey and Chicken dinner has 42% protein and 22% fat, which is an acceptable protein-to-fat ratio per the AAFCO’s guidelines for an adult-maintenance diet.</p>

<p>Our recommendations for best dry dog food are based on the analysis and comparison of 27 products that can be purchased at big-box stores, supermarkets, pet supply stores and online.</p>
<p>We’ve selected <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NatureS-Logic-Canine-Salmon-26-4Lb/dp/B000FAK3RU/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature’s Logic</a> as the best dry dog food. Nature’s Logic has nine formulas of dry dog food. All the recipes have non-GMO millet in their first five ingredients, so they’re not grain-free. Millet, however, is an excellent source of phosphorus, B vitamins and iron, and it’s a carbohydrate that’s easier for dogs to digest.</p>
<p>There is no corn, soy, wheat, rice, peas or lentils in any of Nature’s Logic’s dry foods. Peas and lentils are often added to dog foods as a grain replacement. Peas, lentils and other legumes are currently being studied by the FDA as possible links to canine heart disease, so we applaud Nature’s Logic excluding them from their recipes.</p>
<p>The Duck &amp; Salmon Meal Feast has three meat meals — duck, turkey and salmon — rather than whole meat, which do not diminish in moisture and weight when processed. So you’re actually getting more meat in Nature’s Logic that you would in other dry dog foods that list meat as the first ingredient</p>

<p>Also added to the ingredients are 19 different dried fruits and vegetables with antioxidant properties and menhaden fish meal, which is high in Omega-3 fat content.</p>
<p>Nature’s Logic has eight other varieties of dry dog food, but the majority have chicken (or other identified animal) fat as the third ingredient and pumpkin seed as the fourth ingredient. We prefer the Duck &amp; Salmon recipe to the others because it has three meat meals. Only the Venison and the Rabbit recipes have more than one meat meal as a primary ingredient.</p>
<p>Using the dry method calculation, Nature&#8217;s Logic duck and salmon recipe has 40% protein and 19% fat, which is an appropriate protein-to-fat ratio by AAFCO standards. The Nature’s Logic label states that its food provides complete and balanced nutrition for all life stages and complies with AAFCO nutritional adequacy standards.</p>

<p>Orijen is a Canadian company that takes great pride in not using meat meals in their foods. Based on our analysis, we would agree with Orijen’s marketing that their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Orijen-Original-Formula-Wild-Caught-NEST-Laid/dp/B07MN2LV1F/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Original Dry Dog Food</a> is indeed biologically appropriate. Not only does Orijen dehydrate their fresh meats, but they’re also up-front about the fact that poultry bones and cartilage are ground up in the mix.</p>
<p>Eighty-five percent of the Orijen &#8211; Original is composed of meat, and the remaining 15% includes vegetables, fruits and herbs. The only additive is a zinc chelate, which helps promote a healthy immune system.</p>
<p>The Orijen &#8211; Original is grain free, and like other grain-free dog foods, a variety of legumes — lentils, pinto beans, green peas, navy beans and chickpeas — are added instead. As we noted earlier, the FDA is currently studying the links between grain-free and legume-heavy diets and canine heart disease.</p>

This superior Canadian-made dog food is one of the few we analyzed that is species appropriate.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Orijen-Original-Formula-Wild-Caught-NEST-Laid/dp/B07MN2LV1F/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Orijen has eight recipes in total, two of which are designed for puppies. Orijen states that all of their foods are 85% whole or dried meats, and we don’t doubt that. For the Original recipe, three and three-quarters pounds of fresh, raw and dehydrated meats, fish and whole eggs are used to make a 4.5-pound bag of food. However, during processing, the actual weight of the raw meats and fish is greatly diminished.</p>
<p>That said, the rest of Orijen’s dehydrated meat and fish ingredients make up for the loss, and it’s why their dog foods are so protein-packed. With its abundance of meat, Orijen &#8211; Original has 43% protein and 20% fat, which is an above-average amount of protein to fat.</p>
<p>Orijen &#8211; Original (and all Orijen dog foods) is formulated to meet the nutritional standards established by the AAFCO for all stages of canine life. It’s an excellent dry dog food, but it’s about one-third more expensive than other high-quality grain-free brands. In our estimation, it’s the best grain-free dry dog food and worth the price.</p>

<p>Canidae has four formulas in their All Life Stages dry dog food, and of the four, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CANIDAE-Life-Stages-Multi-Protein-Formula/dp/B0009XQWDM/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Multi-Protein Formula</a> recipe is the best.  Canidae doesn’t use corn, wheat or soy, but there is a significant amount of brown rice, white rice and rice bran in all of their formulas, usually as the second, third and fourth ingredients.</p>
<p>The Multi-Protein Formula, however, is the exception in this brand and lists chicken meal, turkey meal and lamb meal as its first three ingredients. Ocean fish meal and salmon oil are far down the list but are most likely in the same proportions as the preceding millet, barley, oatmeal and flaxseed.</p>
<p>Protein is calculated at 26%, which is below the average of other dry dog food, and fat is 16%, which is about average.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whole-Earth-Farms-Recipe-12-7-Ounce/dp/B00LP9DDE0/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whole Earth Farms &#8211; Grain-Free Adult Recipe</a> is a canned food and has meat in its first five ingredients: chicken, chicken broth, turkey, chicken liver and whitefish. Peas, potatoes, carrots and apples round out this well-balanced dog food. Its dry matter protein is 43% and fat is 27%. This recipe blend has about the same acceptable protein-to-fat ratio as the Castor &amp; Pollux &#8211; Organix Butcher &amp; Bushel.</p>
<p>Whole Earth Farms has three other blends that also have meats and fish as primary ingredients. The company also makes a variety of high-quality meat stews. These, however, have broths as their second and third ingredients and consequently don’t meet all the criteria of what makes the best canned dog food.</p>

<p>Wellness has a large variety of canned dog foods, which they call “paté.” Their CORE blends are packed with meat or fish as primary ingredients.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wellness-Natural-Canned-Venison-12-5-Ounce/dp/B007M0JEHQ/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beef, Venison &amp; Lamb Formula</a> lists beef, beef broth, beef liver, pork liver, venison and lamb as the first six ingredients, followed by chicken meal (another source of meat) and antioxidant fruits and vegetables. This recipe is packed with protein (calculated by the dry method basis) at 54%, but its fat is 36%, which is higher than the AAFCO average.</p>

<p>Castor &amp; Pollux has several Ultramix dry dog food formulas, and they all have meat and meat meal as their primary ingredients. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Ultramix-Grain-Recipe-Bites/dp/B0123HC0V4/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Red Meat Recipe</a> is grain-free and has beef, pork meal and lamb meal as its first three ingredients. Some of the beef’s weight is lost in the processing, but this is compensated with the addition of freeze-dried raw beef nuggets.</p>
<p>The Red Meat Recipe is packed with additional meats and fish meal, vegetables and antioxidant fruits. The only ingredient that’s not identified is “natural flavor.” The AAFCO defines natural flavoring as &#8220;materials treated with heat, enzymes and/or acids to form concentrated natural flavors.&#8221; This is such a high quality dog food, we would prefer that Castor &amp; Pollux stated what’s in their natural flavor.</p>
<p>As might be expected, the Red Meat Recipe has lots of protein, 42%, and surprisingly low fat, 17%. Similar to Orijen &#8211; Original, this is an above average protein-to-fat ratio.</p>
<h2 id="others-no-recommend">Other products we do not recommend</h2>
<p>As Dr. Karen Beckers says “a dog needs to thrive not just survive.” The following canned and dry dog foods are popular and have been around for years. They meet the minimum AAFCO standards. Their ingredients are unidentified meat and meat by-products, starch and other fillers or unnecessary additives.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/3-5OZ-SteakEgg-Dog-Food-Cesar/dp/B00QN6NWKA/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cesar Sunrise: Grilled Steak &amp; Eggs Flavor</a>: The primary ingredients in this particular recipe are water, beef by-products, animal (unidentified) liver, meat (unidentified) by-products, beef and chicken by-products. You certainly do not want to feed your dog unidentified meat. The AAFCO is very specific about how meat should be identified on the label.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Purina-Prime-Gravy-Dog-Food/dp/B00AQT8B8I/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alpo Prime Cuts</a>: This popular and cheap canned food’s first listed ingredient is water, which means that it is the heaviest ingredient by weight. The next ingredient is unidentified poultry, which, as defined by the AAFCO, is cleaned meat, skin and bones of any bird considered to be poultry. Unfortunately, the manufacturer is not required to state what type of bird is used.</p>
<p>The third most abundant ingredient is unidentified meat by-products. Packed with wheat gluten, soy flour, modified corn starch (as a thickener) and artificial coloring, we advise you to pass this one by.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pedigree-Choice-Gravy-Adult-Canned/dp/B008572JC2/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pedigree Choice Cuts</a>: Again, the first and heaviest ingredient is water, followed by chicken, meaning meat and bone. But then the third primary ingredient is — like Alpo — unidentified meat by-products. This canned food is also full of unnecessary additives, like sodium nitrate, food coloring and gluten.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Purina-Dog-Chow-Complete-Adult/dp/B0789N3KRH/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Purina Dog Chow</a>: This long-time favorite is representative of what dry dog food should <i>not </i>be. On Amazon, a 52-pound bag is less than $27, which indicates how cheap the ingredients must be. Dog Chow’s number one ingredient is corn. The next four ingredients are unidentified poultry by-product meal, corn gluten meal, beef fat, ground rice and soybean meal. Other highly objectionable ingredients are beef, egg and chicken flavors, unidentified poultry and pork digest (concentrated liquid from boiled-down animal parts) and four artificial colorants.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kibbles-Bits-Original-Chicken-31-Pound/dp/B01KA7W3KM/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kibbles ‘n Bits</a>: This popular dry dog food is another example of a cheaply made product with corn as its main ingredient. Throw in corn syrup, fat and unidentified animal digest, and this low-grade dry dog food is about as nutritious as fast food.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Your dog’s age, breed, health and activity level will factor into which dog food is the best for him/her.  There are many dog foods available, but not all of them might be right for your dog, so you should discuss feeding options with your veterinarian.</p>
<p>Our recommendations are based on analyzing the ingredients and nutritional statements of more than 50 canned and dry dog foods. We compared them to the test protocols and standards established by the AAFCO for determining “complete and balanced nutrition at all life stages.”</p>
<p>For the best canned dog food, we recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Organix-Butcher-Organic-Carrots-Potatoes/dp/B00DQR8TXO/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Castor &amp; Pollux &#8211; Organix Butcher &amp; Bushel</a>. The chopped turkey and chicken dinner is grain free and has three organic meats as its primary ingredients combined with vegetables and antioxidant fruits.</p>
<p>Our choice for best dry dog food is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Organix-Butcher-Organic-Carrots-Potatoes/dp/B00DQR8TXO/?tag=ybddogfd-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature’s Logic &#8211; Canine Duck &amp; Salmon Meal Feast</a>. Its three meat-based (duck, turkey and salmon) meals are mixed with concentrates of fruits and vegetables. Nature’s Logic adds no artificial vitamins or minerals and uses no synthetic colors or flavors.</p>

<h2 id="selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>In determining products to test we always seek out expert advice, and as we dug into our research, we discovered that pretty much anyone who owns a dog considers themselves an expert. A plethora of publications, websites and pet-food suppliers offer a wide range of opinions about dog treats that are often unreliable, since they’re actually just selling products.</p>
<p>Missing from all online resources is actual testing. Many dog trainers and veterinarians provide recommendations for dog treats based on years of working with hundreds of dogs. Yet none — at least that we could find — back up their opinions with test results. Surprisingly, we were covering new territory.</p>
<p>We focused our research on the best treats for puppy and dog training that were also healthy. This led us down another rabbit hole: the labeling of ingredients. What one expert calls healthy and natural, another expert calls harmful to your dog’s health, and indeed, many dog treats are loaded with chemicals and preservatives.</p>
<p>Since we would be having dogs sample a variety of treats, we needed to assure their owners that the the ingredients of the treats were safe and wouldn’t cause their dog any intestinal distress. We chose treats that had easily digestible meats (such as rabbit and turkey), vegetables and whole grains and were of a size and texture that a puppy or elderly dog could eat. We also spoke with veterinarians and trainers about which type of treat that was the most effective for puppy and dog training.</p>

<h2 id="types">Types of treats</h2>
<p>If you’re a dog parent, then it’s likely that you reward your fur baby with some kind of treat, such as a biscuit, a jerky stick or simply a piece of chicken or cheese. Treats, of course, are also excellent for training a puppy or dog.</p>
<p>Dog trainer and behaviorist <a href="http://www.bratdog.biz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theresa Botello</a> told us that the most effective way to motivate a dog to perform basic commands is to reward him/her with food. If the treat is meat or contains meat, your dog might leap through hoops. Every dog should know the basic commands, and the potent combination of a treat and encouragement will ensure that your dog learns the basics.</p>
<p>Treats are, of course, not only for rewarding your dog, but are often given as a snack in between meals. Treats should never be used as a meal replacement, because your dog won’t get his/her necessary daily nutrients.</p>
<p>There are four types of dog treats:</p>
<p><strong>Soft and chewy pellets</strong>, which dog trainers recommend because they’re a quick reward that won’t distract the dog from progressing to his/her next task. This type of treat is perfect for giving to puppies and senior dogs with chewing problems.</p>
<p><strong>Baked biscuits</strong> are the most common treat. They&#8217;re not ideal as a training reward, because they can be too large for a pup or smaller dog to chew quickly. Biscuits are better for occasional snacks.</p>
<p><strong>Freeze-dried meat</strong> is another great motivator, but it’s not ideal for puppies, whose teeth haven’t fully developed, or senior dogs with dental issues.</p>
<p><strong>Meat jerky</strong> can be difficult and time-consuming for dogs to chew, so these also fall into the snacking category.</p>

<p>Dogs, like humans, get bored with their food, and as a dog owner, you probably have found yourself walking up and down the aisles of your local pet-food supplier and wondering what treat you should buy. Dog treats aren’t manufactured to appeal to a dog’s sight and sensibilities but to the owner’s. So although the brightly colored packaging that claims the product is “wild” or “heritage” might leap off the shelf and into your cart, you should read its ingredient label first.</p>
<h3>Labeling</h3>
<p>The Association of American Feed Officials (AAFCO) works with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that the labeling of all pet food follows industry-wide rules. Before offering our “test subjects”  any treats, we believed it would be responsible to research what’s actually in them first.</p>
<p>Ingredients for dog treats (<a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-dog-food/">and all dog food</a>) are listed by weight. Proportions and ratios, however, are not notated, so although the first ingredient may be beef, you won’t actually know how much of the treat is actually composed of beef. If there are two or more ingredients of the same weight, the manufacturer can list them in any order.</p>
<h3>Primary ingredients</h3>
<p>Ingredients are listed by weight before processing. For example, you might see chicken listed as the first ingredient. But 70% of any meat is water, and once it’s been dehydrated for dry food, the meat loses substantial weight and could account for less than 20% of total ingredients.</p>
<p>However, you still want an identifiable whole meat as the first ingredient.</p>
<p><b>De-boned beef:</b> The first ingredient in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Buffalo-Tender-Soft-Moist-Training/dp/B07D9YCQMW/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue Buffalo &#8211; BLUE Bits</a> means that the beef’s bones have been removed before processing. Beef bones are generally not processed, but chicken and turkey bones often make their way into the mixture.</p>
<p><b>By-products:</b> As defined by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (<a href="https://www.aafco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AAFCO</a>), by-products contain carcasses of the slaughtered animal and can include heads, neck, feet and cleaned intestines.</p>
<p><b>Meal</b> or <b>by-product meal:</b> Used for kibble and treats, meal is the dry, hard material from dehydrated meat or by-products.</p>
<p>As a general rule, fewer processed ingredients listed as primary ingredients correlates to a higher-quality treat.</p>
<h3>Organic vs natural</h3>
<p>As with food for human consumption, the organic versus natural debate is confusing with dog treats. Manufacturers don’t make it any easier for us to understand the difference when they advertise their dog treat is made with “all-natural ingredients.” So what exactly differentiates an organic dog treat from a natural dog treat?</p>
<p><b>Organic: </b>Restrictions are identical to organic food for human consumption. The ingredients in organic dog treats (and all organic dog food) must not have been genetically engineered or irradiated and produced without antibiotics, pesticides, hormones or conventional fertilizers.</p>
<p><b>Natural: </b> Ingredients for natural dog treats must be made of identified animal meat without by-products, chemical preservatives or artificial coloring or flavors.</p>
<p>Most treats are made with “natural” ingredients, so of the nine treats we tested, only one was labeled “organic&#8221;: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wet-Noses-Natural-Treats-Bananas/dp/B006M3Y5WS/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wet Noses &#8211; Organic Dog Treats</a> is made of five organic ingredients. To our surprise, it was our dog testers’ least-favorite treat.</p>
<h3>Calories</h3>
<p>Calories are listed on the labeling for pet food as kilocalories or kcals. They&#8217;re actually the same calories for humans and are interchangeable.</p>
<p>Many manufacturers of dog treats add sugar or other sweeteners to their product as a flavor enhancer. Just like us, dogs can get pudgy around the middle, so if you really want to dote on your dog, you need to watch how many treats you give him/her every day.</p>
<p>Veterinarians advise that as a general rule treats should not make up more than 10 percent of a dog’s daily caloric intake. It’s actually very easy to calculate what that is.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Step 1: </b>Divide your dog’s weight in pounds by 2.2.<br />
<b>Step 2:</b> Multiply that number by 30.<br />
<b>Step 3:</b> Add 70, and this will give you your dog’s daily calorie requirement.<br />
<b>Step 4: </b>Multiply the total by 10%.</p></blockquote>
<p>For example, from the above calculation, a 30-pound dog’s daily calorie requirement is 479, and 10% of that would be 48. So the 30-pound dog should only be fed 48 calories’ worth of treats per day.</p>
<p>Fortunately most manufacturers list calories per treat. Once you’ve calculated your dog’s 10 percent calorie allowance for treats, it’s easy to figure out how many your dog can eat per day. Our dog testers loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B018LH5CHY/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue Buffalo &#8211; BLUE Wilderness Trail Treats</a>, but at 41 calories each, a 30-pound dog could only eat one per day without putting on the pounds.</p>
<h3>Mystery ingredients</h3>
<p>There are a number of ingredients on dog treat labels that are not immediately recognizable. In most cases, these “mystery ingredients” are not harmful to dogs.</p>
<p><strong>Mixed tocopherols:</strong> Almost all of the dog treats we tested had this additive. It’s another name for Vitamin E and is used as a natural preservative.</p>
<p><strong>Potassium chloride</strong>: A chemical compound similar to table salt. In combination with potassium, it helps regulate blood flow through the dog’s heart and cells</p>
<p><strong>Zinc proteinate</strong>: An antioxidant that promotes healing.</p>
<p><strong>Calcium carbonate</strong>: An essential mineral for a dog’s bone and teeth development and strength.</p>
<p><strong>Soy or sunflower lecithin</strong>: A naturally occurring emulsifier and an antioxidant. Lecithin is safe for dogs, unless it’s artificially derived. It’s required to state the type of lecithin that was added.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet lupin meal</strong>: Lupin is a legume that’s used as an alternative to soy.</p>
<p><strong>Maltodexterin</strong>: A sugar derived from starch, it’s commonly added as a sweetener.</p>
<p><strong>Sorbic acid</strong>: A chemically produced preservative.</p>
<p><strong>Dextrose</strong>: A sweetener derived from corn.</p>
<h3>Ingredients to avoid</h3>
<p><b>Xylitol:</b> Used as a sugar substitute in many foods, including chewing gum and some brands of peanut butter (a favorite dog snack), xylitol is highly toxic for dogs. Even a tiny amount can cause seizures, liver failure and even death.</p>
<p><b>Sugar and corn syrup: </b>Dogs process glucose similarly to humans and can result in the same problems we have from eating too much sugar, such as weight gain, tooth decay and diabetes.</p>
<p><b>BHA and BHT: </b>These commonly used preservatives have been proven to increase the risk of cancer in animals. Unfortunately, many popular dog treats, such as Milk-Bone, contain BHA.</p>
<h3>Jerky treats warning</h3>
<p>Since 2007, more than 6,200 cases of canine illness and 1,100 deaths have been reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a result of dogs eating chicken, duck and sweet potato jerky treats manufactured in China. The FDA continually publishes <a href="https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/ucm360951.htm#challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual updates</a> to its ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>The illnesses and deaths spiked in 2013, and thanks to the FDA’s efforts to inform the public, reported cases of dogs sickened by jerky treats have decreased substantially. However, the FDA advises that pet owners should only feed dogs jerky treats that are made in the U.S. from locally sourced animals and plants.</p>
<h3>How dog treats are made</h3>
<h4>Biscuits</h4>
<p>Today the most common method for mass-producing dog biscuits is a completely automated system of mixing, shaping, baking  and packaging. Water is added to dry ingredients, and the paste-like substance is heated. Animal meal or byproducts are then incorporated, and the mixture is piped into molds of different shapes.</p>
<p>The biscuits are transferred by conveyor belt to ovens and baked at high heat until dehydrated to about 10% moisture. Fats, flavorings and vitamins are sprayed onto the cooled biscuits, which are then packaged.</p>
<h4>Soft-moist treats</h4>
<p>These are made in a similar way to biscuits. However, a softening agent, such as vegetable glycerin, gives the treat its slightly chewy texture. Once the mixture has been extruded into shapes, the treats are baked at a lower temperature than biscuits are to retain moisture of approximately 30%. A good example of a soft-moist treat is our runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Buffalo-Tender-Soft-Moist-Training/dp/B07D9YCQMW/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue Buffalo &#8211; BLUE Bits</a>.</p>
<h4>Freeze-dried meats</h4>
<p>Raw meat is cut into bite-size pieces and flash frozen inside a vacuum chamber. Once the meat is frozen, the vacuum removes virtually all moisture. Since bacteria and other microorganisms require water to survive, the freeze-dried meats are naturally preserved without needing any chemical preservatives.</p>
<h3>DIY dog treats</h3>
<p>If you want to avoid any risk of feeding something that could be harmful to your dog, there are many recipes for making your own treats. Many veterinarians and professional organizations suggest foregoing baked or dried treats altogether and reward your dog with certain vegetables, fruit or cubes of cooked chicken. There is also an abundance of resources online for baking your own dog biscuits and drying out meat in a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-food-dehydrator/">food dehydrator</a> for jerky treats.</p>
<h2 id="dental">Dental chews</h2>
<p>Regularly brushing your dog’s teeth or having his/her teeth professionally cleaned by a vet is the best way for eliminating plaque buildup. However, not all dogs allow owners to brush their teeth, and teeth-cleaning at a vet’s office is expensive. Many pet owners resort to giving a dental chew to their dog.</p>
<p>Some dental chews are meant for occasional use while others &#8212; like the popular Greenies &#8212; are intended for daily use. But what’s in a dental chew, and does it actually clean a dog’s teeth and freshen his/her breath as advertised?</p>
<h3>Ingredients in dental chews</h3>
<p>We examined the labels of several dental chews, and these are a few examples of their primary ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wheat flour</li>
<li>Wheat gluten</li>
<li>Gelatin</li>
<li>Glycerin</li>
<li>Potato starch</li>
<li>Tapioca starch</li>
<li>Rice starch</li>
<li>Natural poultry or chicken liver flavor</li>
</ul>
<p>During the manufacture &#8212; similar to how biscuits are made &#8212; a range of chemicals, minerals, sweeteners and preservatives is added to the mixture or sprayed over the chew. “Natural poultry flavor” just means chicken fat.</p>
<p>Other chews are made of beefhide that are chemically treated to purportedly prevent plaque buildup. One particularly egregious example is <a href="https://us.virbac.com/home/our-products/pagecontent/product-selector/cetenzymatic-oral-hygiene-chews.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virbac’s C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews</a> that lists “poultry digest” &#8212; a flavor enhancer made from boiled-down liquid chicken concentrate &#8212; and dextrose, a corn-derived sugar.</p>
<h3>Do dental chews work?</h3>
<p>Despite the many “veterinarian-recommended” dental chews on the market, the reality is that a dental chew should not replace dental hygiene. Dental chews may help retard the buildup of plaque and tartar. But the <a href="http://www.vohc.org/veterinary_oral_health.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veterinary Oral Health Council</a> states that the key to strong teeth is keeping your dog’s gums healthy with regular brushing.</p>
<h3>The risks of dental chews</h3>
<p>Dogs certainly love to chew, but not all dogs chew everything to bits before swallowing. The most common risk with dental chews is that the dog will chew it only long enough to break it down so it can be swallowed. These larger pieces are often indigestible and can cause vomiting, diarrhea or intestinal blockage.</p>
<p>This risk is most prevalent with rawhide treats. Rawhide softens as the dog continues to gnaw on it. The softened rawhide stops any teeth-cleaning propensity it might have had and breaks down into pieces that many dogs swallow whole.</p>
<p>The popular Greenies has been subject to a couple of lawsuits &#8212; both settled &#8212; for <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/02/14/dangerous.dogtreat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dog deaths</a> and <a href="https://www.petfoodindustry.com/articles/5288-mars-sued-over-greenies-1-vet-recommended-claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">false advertising</a>. Greenies and the one dental chew we tested <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whimzees-Natural-Dental-Treats-Alligator/dp/B01F71E5Z2/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whimzees &#8211; Natural Daily Dental Treats</a> are made of wheat flour and potato starch, respectively, which a dog can easily break down and swallow &#8212; sometimes nearly whole &#8212; in about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>As a result of the lawsuit, most dog chews are now labeled with an advisory that the owner is solely responsible for choosing the size of chew that&#8217;s proportional to their dog’s weight and ability to chew. Veterinarians and dog experts warn that a dog should not be left unattended while he/she consumes a dental chew.</p>
<h3>Whimzees &#8211; Natural Dental Treats</h3>
<p>Taking all of the risks and warnings under consideration, we decided to test only one dental chew, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whimzees-Natural-Dental-Treats-Alligator/dp/B01F71E5Z2/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whimzees &#8211; Natural Daily Dental Treats</a>. Whimzees is highly rated on Amazon, and although they are manufactured in Holland and not the U.S., people seem to trust the company’s claim of all-natural ingredients.</p>
<p>Whimzees primary ingredients are potato starch, glycerin and cellulose. The most popular variety are shaped like alligators and are colored orange, green and yellow-gold by paprika, alfalfa and sweet lupin meal. (The other variety is shaped like a toothbrush.)</p>
<p>The feeding guidelines posted at the top of the bag gave us pause:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Recommended for dogs nine months and a minimum of 15 pounds in weight. As with any edible chew, monitor your dog while chewing. Ensure that your dog adequately chews the product. Swallowing any item without adequately chewing may be harmful or fatal to a dog.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This seems less like a “guideline” and more like a legal disclaimer. Reluctantly, our tester and his friend gave a Whimzee to each of their dogs &#8212; Archie, a 32-pound terrier mix and Max, a 15-pound Pomeranian mix. Both dogs chowed down the Whimzee in less than seven minutes. Max had no reaction, but Archie vomited up undigested pieces later in the night.</p>
<p>Based on that experience, we chose to not test Whimzees on any other dogs.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dog-running2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Nine dogs participated in our study. They were predominantly mixed-breed dogs, between one and seven years old and weighing between 10 and 70 pounds. Each dog participated with no other dogs nearby.</p>
<p>We separated the dog treats into three categories &#8212; biscuits, soft-moist and freeze-dried &#8212; and performed the same test in the same conditions for each category. For example, each of the three biscuits we tested were put into a separate bowl. The owner held the dog as we placed the three bowls on the floor in no particular order. Once we set the bowls down, the owner released the dog.</p>
<p>We recorded how the dog sniffed, tasted and ate each treat and in what order. We then repeated the test two more times, mixing up the bowls, and noting if the dog had a preference. Throughout the tests we instructed the dog’s owner to offer no encouragement, reaction or other vocal or visual response.</p>

<p>Finally, because we wouldn’t give our dogs something we wouldn’t eat ourselves, we sniffed and taste-tested all of the dog treats.</p>

<p>Pretty much across the board, the dogs’ favorite treat was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Treat-Stewart-Freeze-Dried-Treats/dp/B00SX4V7NE/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stewart &#8211; Pro-Treat</a>. It’s a single ingredient &#8212; freeze-dried beef liver &#8212; with no preservatives or flavor enhancers added.</p>
<p>Stewart has been in business for 40 years, and they manufacture their freeze-dried products in a USDA-monitored plant. Their impressive range of products includes freeze-dried livers of chicken, duck, turkey, bison, lamb and pork, powdered liver as flavor enhancers for canine medical diets and freeze-dried cubes of skin-on wild salmon. (If you happen to own a ferret, Stewart also has freeze-dried chicken or turkey liver for your critter.)</p>
<p>Ninety-percent of our dogs charged for the Pro-Treat first and gobbled it down before sampling the other two treats. They would also return to the bowl and lick it several times. We switched out bowls and positioned them differently, and each time, the dogs ate the Pro-Treat first.</p>

<p>The treats are solid cubes, so they won’t crumble in your pocket during a training session. We recommend breaking them into smaller bits for training, especially if you’re training a puppy, because a whole cube &#8212; about ½ inch in diameter &#8212; takes a bit of gnawing for smaller dogs.</p>
<p>You’ll only need a little piece for each training task, because they’re obviously so flavorful and delicious-smelling for a dog that he/she will respond to any command. (If you enjoy the smell and taste of liver, they&#8217;re not too bad for humans as well.)</p>

<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Stewart &#8211; Pro-Treat is 100% freeze-dried meat, which dog trainers recommend as the best treat for training dogs and puppies.</li>
<li>It’s a high-quality one-ingredient treat manufactured in a human-grade USDA-monitored plant.</li>
<li>It has no preservatives or additives, and 90% of our test dogs preferred it over the other treats we tested.</li>

<p>Another winner with our dog taste-testers was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018LH5CHY/?tag=ybddogtrt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue Buffalo &#8211; BLUE Wilderness Trail Treats</a>. Blue Buffalo markets their Wilderness line of products as “inspired by the diet of wolves,” and the meats in their grain-free, high-protein kibble and treats include venison, duck, game birds and, in the “Bayou Blend,” alligator.</p>
<p>In 2013, a class-action suit was filed against Blue Buffalo for willingly advertising chicken and turkey wet dog food as healthy when the food had significant levels of lead, resulting in canine illness and death. However, nothing could be proven, and the lawsuit was thrown out in 2018. The class-action suit was only aimed at Blue Buffalo wet dog food and not the treats. We still believe the Blue Buffalo products are high quality and safe for your dogs.</p>
<p>The salmon biscuits that we tested are loaded with salmon and a few other ingredients as binding agents, like potato, flaxseed and chicken meal. They’re high in protein (33%), low in fat (16%) and contain Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids.</p>
<p>The biscuit is a dense one-inch square, and because of the high protein, they are 41 calories per piece. In fact, the BLUE biscuits are so high in calories they should only be given to your dog sparingly.</p>

<p>They’re not a hard biscuit, but have a crispy texture like a whole-wheat cracker. Their fragrant salmon aroma was apparently intoxicating for our dog panel, most of whom ran straight for the bowl in our tests. A couple of our dogs licked the biscuit a few times before devouring it, and only one dog spat it out altogether.</p>
<p>As to the taste, if truth be told, you could put some cream cheese on these biscuits and serve them as an hors d’oeuvre at a cocktail party. Yes, these dog treats are delicious.</p>
<p>The BLUE biscuits are a bit too crumbly to use for dog training and are really best for a snack or reward. The 10-ounce bag has about 50 biscuits, and at around $5.99 it’s reasonably priced for such a high-quality product.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Blue Buffalo &#8211; BLUE Wilderness Trail Treats salmon biscuits are grain-free, packed with aromatic salmon and little else.</li>
<li>They’re too crumbly for dog training, but they’re great for a snack or reward.</li>
<li>With the highest calories of the biscuits we tested, the BLUE salmon biscuits should be given to your dog sparingly.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Buffalo-Tender-Soft-Moist-Training/dp/B07D9YCQMW/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue Buffalo &#8211; BLUE Bits</a> are heart-shaped soft-moist tidbits that are great for house training a puppy or training for basic commands. If you have a senior dog with teeth and gum issues, the soft texture will be easy for him/her to chew.</p>
<p>The soft-moist treat testing had to be conducted several times, because the dogs literally vacuumed up all the different treats in a single snort. However, with repeated testings, two-thirds of the dogs went to the BLUE Bits before the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ZukeS-Naturals-Rabbit-Recipe-Treats/dp/B005VEWKB2/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zuke’s &#8211; Mini Naturals</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Merrick-Turducken-Recipe-Treats-ounces/dp/B00JAEKA3Y/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Merrick &#8211; Power Bites</a>.</p>
<p>We tested the “tender beef” recipe, and upon opening the bag, the Bits smell strongly of the natural smoke flavor that’s been added. It wasn’t particularly pleasant, but the heady scent didn’t turn off our dog testers. They couldn’t get enough of the BLUE Bits.</p>

<p>The primary ingredients are de-boned beef, brown rice, oatmeal, maple syrup and glycerin (which provides the 30% moisture). Potatoes, gelatin and flaxseed give the Bits their texture, and the remaining ingredients &#8212; salmon oil, mixed tocopherols, rosemary and citric acid serve as natural preservatives.</p>
<p>With only 3.5 kcalories per piece, you can reward your senior, low-activity dog or puppy several times a day without worrying about him/her getting chubby. BLUE Bits come in three flavors &#8212; beef, chicken and turkey &#8212; and in various sizes. We tested with the 16-ounce bag, which had about 300 treats, so the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Buffalo-Tender-Soft-Moist-Training/dp/B07D9YCQMW/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue Buffalo &#8211; BLUE Bits</a> are also a good value.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>

<p>The Old Mother Hubbard Baking Company has been around for 90 years, originally making hardtack for fisherman. When a fisherman tossed his dog a bit of hardtack, the dog gobbled it up, and the company began making dog biscuits.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Old-Mother-Hubbard-Assortment-Biscuits/dp/B004B9HQLW/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Old Mother Hubbard &#8211; Classic Crunchy Treats</a> are made primarily of whole wheat flour, oatmeal, wheat bran, chicken fat and cane molasses. The biscuits come in a variety of tasty flavors like bacon and cheese, liver, peanut butter and in different sizes for petite dogs and large dogs. They’re naturally sweetened with carrot and apple, so the addition of molasses and maltodextrin seem unnecessary.</p>
<p>Of course, it comes down to the taste test, and although two dogs loved Old Mother Hubbard biscuits, the other dogs weren’t as interested and went to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B018LH5CHY/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue Buffalo &#8211; BLUE Wilderness Trail Treats</a> first.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to love about Zuke’s. The company manufactures their wide variety of treats in the U.S. and New Zealand, and they have strict quality control and safety standards that exceed the AAFCO standards for pet food. They always test all ingredients for any toxins and bacteria in both the manufacturing and distribution centers.</p>
<p>It was disappointing that only one of our dogs liked <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ZukeS-Naturals-Rabbit-Recipe-Treats/dp/B005VEWKB2/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zuke’s &#8211; Mini Naturals</a> over the two other soft-moist treats. He was so enthusiastic that his owner asked if they were packed with sugar. We checked the ingredients, and the only sweetener is cherries, which is surprising since cherry pits are poisonous for dogs, and the <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/can-dogs-have-cherries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Kennel Club recommends</a> that cherry fruit should not be fed to them.</p>
<p>Although the Mini Naturals’ main ingredient is meat (rabbit in our test sample), despite the company’s claims that there are no fillers, the other ingredients &#8212; ground rice, malted barley, tapico &#8212; seem bulky. In fact, they have a fruity-vegetal aroma rather than a meaty aroma, which may be why our dogs didn’t care for them as much as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Buffalo-Tender-Soft-Moist-Training/dp/B07D9YCQMW/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue Buffalo &#8211; BLUE Bits</a>.</p>

<p>Merrick is another dog food company that puts heart and soul into its product. Based in Texas, Merrick claims that their foods are prepared in the founder’s home kitchen, which has been converted into a commercial kitchen. All of their ingredients are sourced from local farmers, and they refuse to use preservatives, additives or fillers. Merrick also donates to several charities and animal shelters.</p>
<p>We tried out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Merrick-Turducken-Recipe-Treats-ounces/dp/B00JAEKA3Y/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Merrick &#8211; Power Bites Turducken</a> recipe on our dog test-tasters, and some of our dogs loved it while others chose the BLUE Bits or Zuke’s Mini Naturals instead. The Power Bites have nutritious meats, vegetables and fruit, but also listed as primary ingredients are cane molasses and brown sugar.</p>

<p>With all of the rave reviews online, we expected our dogs would gobble up the peanut butter and banana <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wet-Noses-Natural-Treats-Bananas/dp/B006M3Y5WS/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wet Noses &#8211; Organic Dog Treats</a>. This is the only treat we tested that was completely made of USDA-certified organic ingredients. Wet Noses specializes in vegetable and fruit treats, foods and jerky for dogs and cats.</p>
<p>They’re clearly targeting customers who want their pets to eat vegetarian diets. But perhaps a little meat added to their treats might make them more appealing to dogs. As much as we wanted our taste-testers to enjoy the Wet Noses treats, it was always the last one they sampled, and a couple dogs even spat the half-eaten treat out.</p>

<p>Vita Essentials is a family-owned company, located in Green Bay, Wisconsin that produces raw frozen and freeze-dried food, snacks and treats for dogs and cats. Their employees are trained and certified in food safety programs, which is required for handling raw meats. Although Vita Essentials uses only USDA-certified meats, their products are not certified organic.</p>

<p>Hill’s founder, Dr. Mark Morris, Sr., was a pioneer in managing canine and feline illnesses through diet, and his research serves as the nutritional standards for pet foods used today by the AAFCO. Hill’s has several lines of pet foods, one of which requires a veterinarian’s prescription. Hill’s Science Diet, however, can be bought just about anywhere. This brand relies heavily on appealing to dog owners with photographs of luscious roasted chicken or turkey drumsticks on pet food packaging.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hills-Science-Diet-Chicken-Strips/dp/B008OV92WE/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hill’s Science Diet &#8211; Jerky Strips</a> lists chicken as its primary ingredient, but besides that there’s little difference between these “jerky” strips and a dog biscuit. They have a slightly chemical odor that our dog testers didn’t seem to mind.</p>
<p>We’ve listed this treat as our least favorite, because despite the packaging’s claim that the strips are made with “real chicken,” other ingredients listed are “chicken liver flavor,” “chicken flavor” and the mysterious “natural flavors.”</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Nothing makes a dog owner happier than seeing a beloved pet’s wagging tail and toothy grin. If you’re training your new puppy or dog, you’ll need to reward him/her with more than hugs and belly rubs. Nothing motivates a dog more than food, and according to dog trainers, the best motivator of all is something meaty.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Treat-Stewart-Freeze-Dried-Treats/dp/B00SX4V7NE/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stewart &#8211; Pro-Treats</a> are freeze-dried cubes of raw liver that can be fed whole or broken into small bits. Our panel of nine dogs was unanimous: no matter their age or size, they couldn’t get enough of the Pro-Treats.</p>
<p>For an everyday treat or snack, we recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018LH5CHY/?tag=ybddogtrt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue Buffalo &#8211; BLUE Wilderness Trail Treats</a>. These crunchy biscuits are packed with salmon and wholesome all-natural ingredients that our dog taste-testers went nuts over.</p>
<p>If you have a senior dog with teeth issues or a puppy that’s teething and can’t quite chomp down on a biscuit yet, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Buffalo-Tender-Soft-Moist-Training/dp/B07D9YCQMW/?tag=ybddogtrts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue Buffalo &#8211; BLUE Bits</a> are tender and moist tidbits that any dog young or old can chew.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver a six-week period we tested the top three upright canister vacuums on the market that are specifically designed for pet hair.

<h2 id="selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by checking out websites that are devoted to pet care, such as Rover.com, and other websites that reviewed and made recommendations for the best pet hair vacuum. It soon became obvious that almost none state how they tested the vacuums, and most recommend vacuums for general purposes and not those specifically designed for the challenges posed by pet hair and dander.</p>
<p>We decided to focus on vacuums that either had a special pet hair attachment, such as a mechanized roller brush, or vacuums that were specially designed for vacuuming pet hair. Once we had assembled our list, we narrowed it down to the vacuums reviewed by Amazon consumers as the most effective, durable and easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="six-best">Compare the best vacuums for pet hair</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pet-vac-lineup-b.jpg" alt="lineup of tested pet hair vacuums" width="2000" height="1335" /><br />
[table id=213 /]
<h2 id="who">Who needs a pet hair vacuum?</h2>
<p>Dog and cat owners can probably agree on one thing: their fur baby sheds constantly, and if you allow them on the furniture or in your bed, then you’ve got pet hair everywhere. Pets shed all year round, and many dog breeds have shedding seasons when they lose their top coats and thick undercoats all at once. If you don’t keep up with it, you’ll be suffocating in tumbleweeds of hair.</p>
<p>You could be conscientiously grooming your pet every day, but you’re not just dealing with hair; you’ve got to rid your living space of dander too. For people with allergies, those microscopic flecks of skin will make them miserable if the air is filled with dander. Air purifiers certainly help, but you need a vacuum that can simultaneously suction up pet hair and filter pet dander.</p>
<p>Vacuums, of course, come in many shapes, styles and sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upright bagless canister</li>
<li>Upright bagged canister</li>
<li><a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-stick-vacuum/">Stick vacuum</a></li>
<li>Corded handheld</li>
<li>Cordless handheld</li>
<li>Robot vacuum</li>
</ul>
<p>The vacuum that will be most effective on pet hair will depend on the size of your home and whether you have carpet, hardwood floor or both.</p>
<p>Most vacuum manufacturers advertise that their product is best for pet hair, and some simply stamp a paw print icon on their product’s box to target pet owners. We learned from our research, however, that the differences between a regular vacuum and a vacuum for pet hair are actually pretty minimal.</p>
<p>In fact, when we compared handheld pet hair vacuums with the &#8220;regular&#8221; vacuums in <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/">our handheld vacuums review</a>, we found that they were notably similar. A pet hair handheld vacuum may have an additional feature, such as a motorized beater-brush like our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07</a>, or a rubber comb, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>Manufacturers claim that a bagged canister vacuum is the most powerful for deep cleaning on a regular basis. But if you’re a pet owner who wants to vacuum every day, it doesn’t make sense to lug one of those around to every room and up and down stairs.</p>
<p>An upright bagless canister vacuum is lightweight, has great maneuverability and is easy to clean. It’s really the best and most convenient for vacuuming pet hair up from both carpeting and bare floor.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Cyclone separation technology:</b> You’ve probably read or heard about “cyclonic” vacuums. Dyson is the most famous vacuum that uses cyclone separation. (Check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/dyson-v7-trigger-vacuum/">Dyson review here.</a>) In brief, it’s a method for creating a rotating high-speed air flow, like a mini cyclone, that sucks everything up into the vacuum. The vortex inside the vacuum canister keeps the pet hair elevated and spinning. Dust and dander are then separated from the hair by centrifugal force and are trapped in an air filter.</p>
<p><b>Air filtration:</b> An air filtration system collects dust and dander from pet hair, and in some cases, freshens the air flowing through the vacuum’s exhaust vents. All upright canister vacuums have a filter made of sponge, foam or ridged fabric. The filters are easy to remove and clean by simply running them through water and squeezing them dry.</p>
<p>A HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter — found in many air purifiers — is often a secondary filter in a vacuum cleaner, and it traps virtually all airborne particles. Of the three upright canister vacuums we tested, only our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> had the additional HEPA filter.</p>
<p><b>Beater brush control:</b> The rotating brush — or beater brush — under an upright canister vacuum whisks up embedded dirt and debris from a carpet, which is then sucked into the canister. Beater brushes, however, are not effective on a hardwood floor, since they scatter more hair and dust than they actually brush up. Look for an upright canister vacuum that has a control to turn the beater brush on and off or raises and lowers it.</p>
<p><b>Special pet hair brush attachment:</b> All vacuum cleaners have attachable accessories, such as brushes and extension wands, for vacuuming drapery, upholstery and tight spaces. Upright vacuums for pet hair also have an extension wand, a brush or two and sometimes an upholstery tool, which resembles a lint roller brush.</p>
<p>Two of the upright canister vacuums we tested — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70355B/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</a> — had a special pet hair brush attachment. It’s about one-third the size of the regular beater brush, so you simply attach it to the extension wand and use it to get in between couch pillows or under your bed. Dirt Devil’s attachment has a rubberized claw, which is excellent for raking up hair from pile carpet.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Test conditions</h3>
<p>Our tester lives in a two-bedroom 1200 square-foot condominium that has approximately 90-percent low-pile carpeted floor. Every two weeks for a six-week period, he tested the vacuum cleaners by allowing hair from his mixed-breed terrier to accumulate.</p>
<p>Each vacuum was tested in a specified area of the condo, each area having both carpeted and marble-tile floors and several pieces of upholstered furniture, where his dog was allowed to sit and nap. If the vacuum was portable, our tester also vacuumed sections of the condo’s fifteen carpeted stairs. All of the handheld pet hair vacuums were tested on the stairs.</p>
<p>Our tester owns a Miele bagged canister vacuum and vacuumed an area as a comparison with the three upright bagless canister vacuums we decided to test. He changed the Miele bag at the beginning of the testing period so its suction power would not be diminished.</p>
<p>For the three handheld pet hair vacuums, he also allowed dog hair to accumulate on his car’s upholstered driver and passenger seats, carpeted floor and rear hatchback area.</p>
<h3>Vacuuming</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/vacuuming1.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Our tester vacuumed each designated area three times with each vacuum over the six-week period. After each vacuuming of the carpets and floors, he checked the beater brush to see whether any hair had been trapped in its bristles. If the vacuum had a special attachment for pet hair, he then vacuumed the upholstered furniture. Finally, using the same attachment, he vacuumed a section of the carpeted staircase.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>During the testing our tester noted the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Maneuverability:</b> Two of the uprights we tested &#8212; the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70355B/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</a> &#8212; had swiveled steering, which allowed easy access in corners and beneath the furniture and bed.</li>
<li><b>Weight: </b>Upright canister vacuums are designed to be lightweight. We tested how much effort it took to push the vacuum and also carry up the stairs.</li>
<li><b>Motorized attachment: </b>Several vacuums have a motorized brush attachment and we determined whether motorizing the separate beater brush was actually more efficient in picking up pet hair.</li>
<li><b>Length of power cord:</b> A longer power cord allows convenient access to multiple rooms from one electrical outlet.</li>

<p>After each vacuuming, our tester documented the amount of hair, dust and debris trapped inside the canister and how easy or difficult it was to remove. Unlike a bagged canister vacuum, which does not need its bag changed after each vacuum, a bagless canister vacuum should have its canister emptied and washed every time.</p>
<p>Theoretically the vacuum’s filters should be changed once a year, but presumably that is advisable only if you wash the filters on a regular basis. Our tester noted how much dust each filter collected and washed it to determine its efficacy the next time he vacuumed.</p>
<p>The handheld vacuums were not as easy to clean. It was a challenge removing everything from the compact canister, and the filters were a dusty mess after each use. The Bissell &#8211; 33A1C’s ridged filter was especially troublesome to clean, since pet hair got trapped between the ridges and needed to be extracted by hand.</p>
<h2 id="upright">Best upright for pet hair</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shark-nv350.jpg" alt="Shark NV350" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The most critical thing we can say about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a> is that its power cord could be longer. Besides that, this powerful, quiet and nearly perfect upright canister vacuum will make short work not only of pet hair, but also dirt, dust, debris and and anything else you may vacuum.</p>
<p>(The Shark &#8211; NV350 comes in a number of colors, each of which has a different serial number. We tested the lavender Shark &#8211; NV352.)</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; NV350 is marketed as “liftaway,” which means that the canister can be detached from the main chassis to transform into a portable vacuum. This feature allows you to vacuum anywhere within the power cord’s 25-foot reach and get into tight areas and up and down stairs.</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; NV350’s cyclone separation technology and completely sealed HEPA filtration system suck up every last bit of hair and dust. The HEPA filter also freshens the exhaust air from the side vents.</p>
<p>The canister is removed by unlatching top and bottom latches, which completely prevent any debris from flying up and out when you empty it into the trash. Before the testing period, our tester vacuumed frequently with a Miele bagged canister vacuum, so he was shocked when he saw how much more embedded hair and dust the Shark &#8211; NV350 vacuumed up.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shark-detaching.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>If that wasn’t eye-opening enough, our tester vacuumed over the same areas where he tested the Eureka &#8211; NEU180B and the Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B, and the Shark sucked up a half-full canister of more hair and dust.</p>
<p>The Shark &#8211; NV350 is lightweight — less than 13 pounds — and has superb maneuverability thanks to its swivel steering and motorized power brush. The power brush can be turned on for carpets and off for bare floors. It took slightly more effort to push the Shark on bare floors, but on carpet, it practically whizzed around the room on its own volition.</p>
<p>The Shark has the usual attachments — crevice tools, a couple of brushes — and also includes a pet upholstery tool, which resembles a lint brush. It’s pretty good at picking up pet hair on furniture, but you need to brush in a downward direction.</p>

The sealed filtration system with a HEPA filter removes pet dander and freshens the air as well.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KPPIL6/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Depending on where you purchase the Shark &#8211; NV350, a mini power brush is included (note: the mini power brush is not included with the Shark that is sold by Amazon). It works the same as the large motorized power brush, but it’s about one-third the size, which makes it perfect for stairs and reaching under the bed.</p>
<p>Clean-up is a cinch. The aforementioned liftaway canister makes it easy to empty the vacuumed-up debris into the trash, and it washes clean in seconds. Both foam filters are cleaned by simply rinsing them through with water and squeezing them dry.</p>
<p>Shark offers a five-year limited warranty and a lifetime guarantee for the foam filters and motor belt. The Shark &#8211; NV350 is the most expensive of the three upright canister vacuums we tested, but at $145, it’s still moderately priced for such a high-quality product that outperformed the other vacuums we tested.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight but extremely powerful, the Shark &#8211; NV350 can suction up every last bit of pet hair, dust and debris from both carpeted and non-carpeted floors.</li>
<li>It has excellent maneuverability thanks to its swivel steering and motorized beater brush.</li>
<li>The Shark &#8211; NV350 is one of the few vacuums marketed specifically for cleaning up pet hair that has a sealed filtration system with a HEPA filter.</li>
<li>Its “liftaway” canister turns the vacuum into a portable vacuum for getting into corners, up and down stairs and under furniture.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="handheld">Best handheld for pet hair</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-vac.jpg" alt="Black+Decker - HHVJ325BMP07" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>All three of the handheld vacuums we tested had elements designed specifically for picking up pet hair. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07</a> did the better job of vacuuming dust and dirt as well, thanks to its Smartech auto-sense feature that automatically changes speed and power levels by sensing whether you’re vacuuming carpet, bare floors or upholstery. The auto-sense’s LED indicator also shows battery life and whether it’s time to change the filter.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker is a cordless handheld and is charged by a lithium ion battery for a minimum of six hours. For all of our tests, the charge lasted approximately 18 minutes, which was nearly double the time that the Shark &#8211; SV780 (the other cordless handheld we tested) lasted.</p>
<p>During the period of its charge, the auto-sense did indeed switch speeds when we moved back and forth from carpeting (higher speed), furniture (middle speed) and floor (lowest speed). The charge did dip a bit to about 15 minutes when we kept the vacuum running at its highest speed.</p>
<p>The Black+Decker has very strong suction that lasted during most of its charge, and even when it began to diminish, it was still able to remove stubborn pet hair that clung to car carpeting.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/black-decker-pet-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Crevices and Corners: Black+Decker - HHVJ325BMP07</h3><p>The Black+Decker Pet Dustbuster has a long-lasting battery charge and powerful suction. Its unique sensor automatically shifts power levels from carpets to hardwood floors to upholstery.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The vacuum itself resembles a Dustbuster with an elongated nozzle that can be used for vacuuming tight corners and under cabinets. One of the Black+Decker’s excellent features is its beater-brush attachment that slips on to the nozzle. The brush’s alternating rows of rubber bristles and soft rubber tabs prevent long pet hair from getting wrapped and trapped when you’re vacuuming carpeted areas and upholstery.</p>
<p>We were also impressed by how well the Black+Decker sucked up dust from between couch cushions and pillows, which was revealed when we opened up its canister and examined its dual-filter system.</p>
<p>Everything is sucked into the canister where large debris, such as dog hair or cat litter, is separated. Dirt and dust are forced through the filter cup and trapped in the fabric filter bag that’s locked inside the cup. Once vacuuming is done, the filter cup can be removed and the pet hair in the main container emptied without dust flying everywhere.</p>
<p>Two fabric filters are included with the Black+Decker, one of which is scented and perfumes the exhaust air as you vacuum. The “fresh linen” scent is a bit overpowering, but the second filter bag is unscented. As with all handheld vacuums, they should be cleaned after every use. Cleaning is a simple task since the canister and filters can be quickly rinsed and dried.The Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07 is the most expensive of the three handheld vacuums for pet hair that we tested, but thanks to its brush attachment, we found that it was the only one that “powers through pet hair” as advertised. This is a fantastic all-around handheld vacuum you can use for any small area and upholstery.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07 has unique sensing capability that automatically switches power levels from carpet to bare floors to upholstery.</li>
<li>Its lithium-ion battery charges the Black+Decker for a solid 18 minutes, giving you plenty of time to vacuum a number of small areas.</li>
<li>Its power brush is made of alternating rows of rubber teeth and flaps, which prevent long hair from getting wrapped and trapped.</li>
<li>The Black+Decker’s dual filter system effectively sucks up and traps dust and dirt for easy and quick clean-up.</li>

<h2 id="others">Other products we tested</h2>
<h3>Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dirt-devil-pet-vac.jpg" alt="Dirt Devil - UD70355B" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70355B/dp/B06X978P7W/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil &#8211; UD70355B</a>, also known as the Razor Pet, is another cyclonic upright canister vacuum and appears to be one of the better made vacuums by this company. Dirt Devil markets the Razor Pet for pet owners by stamping a paw print icon on the box and canister, but it’s otherwise similar to the regular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Steerable-Bagless-UD70350B/dp/B06XDK8Q3B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dirt Devil Razor</a>.</p>
<p>The only addition to the Razor Pet is its “turboclaw” attachment. It’s a mini beater brush with nine rubber teeth that presumably are designed to rake up hair from a carpet. However, to work properly, the claw must be held at a 45-degree angle so the beater brush can actually reach the carpet. The vacuum has strong suction, so pet hair is lifted up without the assistance of the useless — but cute — turboclaw.</p>
<p>The Razor Pet did an excellent job of consistently sucking up pet hair into neat whirling balls inside the canister. It has swivel steering like the Shark &#8211; NV350, and you can lower the vacuum head so it’s nearly flat (which lets you get under furniture) but we found the steering to be stiff and not very easy to maneuver. In fact, even though the Razor Pet is lightweight, we needed quite a bit of elbow grease to push the vacuum around.</p>
<p>The cyclonic separation works differently in the Razor Pet than it does in the Shark &#8211; NV350. The vortex keeps the vacuumed hair separated and elevated and dust and dirt is forced upwards through a conical foam-covered filter. A latch on the bottom of the canister releases the hair, but the filter must be removed from the top of the canister by unlatching a needlessly difficult lock.</p>
<p>Once removed, the foam is slipped off the ridged fabric filter, which traps hair between the ridges and must be pulled out by hand. A good amount of dust is trapped in the filter, but since it’s not sealed, like with the Shark &#8211; NV350, the Razor Pet cannot capture pet dander. It’s a good all-around vacuum, but it really isn’t a vacuum for handling the challenges of pet hair.</p>
<h3>Eureka &#8211; NEU180B</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/eureka-neu180b.jpg" alt="Eureka - NEU180B" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-NEU180B-Lightweight-Powerful-Graphite/dp/B07J4R23VJ/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eureka &#8211; NEU180B</a> is an upright canister vacuum that’s marketed specifically as a pet hair vacuum, but again, in reality, it’s just a vacuum with a lint brush tool. It’s very lightweight, because it seems to be made almost entirely of plastic. One Amazon reviewer wrote that it looks like a kid’s toy, and we have to agree. Even though it weighs only ten pounds, we found it difficult to push around carpeted floors, and it has no steering capability at all.</p>
<p>It has an extra large canister, but it’s not a cyclonic vacuum, so everything blows up into and swirls around the lower third of the canister. Other than a thin piece of foam in the canister, the Eureka doesn’t have an air filter system, so clearly it’s not been designed for pet dander and dust — plus, the exhaust air does not smell clean.</p>
<p>The beater brush can purportedly be adjusted to five levels with a lever, two of which are mysteriously not labeled, but we turned the lever to each level, and nothing moved. Since the beater brush should not be used on a hardwood floor, this is a major design flaw.</p>
<p>For such a noisy vacuum, it doesn’t seem to have much suction power. The ultimate test result was that we vacuumed the same area with the other two upright vacuums, which picked up double the amount that the Eureka did.</p>
<h3>Shark &#8211; SV780</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shark-sv780.jpg" alt="Shark - SV780" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>This cordless handheld vacuum has cyclonic technology, like its upright vacuum, with a built-in beater brush. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pet-Perfect-Cordless-Technology-Rechargeable-SV780/dp/B0037HHFMO/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; SV780</a> is powered by a rechargeable 18-volt nickel metal hydride battery, which lasts longer than alkaline batteries in high-drain electronics. Be that as it may, each time we charged the Shark &#8211; SV780, full power lasted slightly less than eight-and-a-half minutes.</p>
<p>For the brief time that the Shark &#8211; SV780 is at full power, it’s got powerful suction and grabbed up everything in its path, including pet hair deeply embedded in car carpeting. Its side vents are positioned beneath the rubberized grip handle, so the exhaust blows backwards and doesn’t scatter the debris you’re vacuuming.</p>
<p>It has a sturdy bag filter that captures dust and dander, and it’s very easy to clean. It’s a terrific handheld vacuum that does indeed seem like it was designed for pet hair. However, because of its short charge, it just doesn’t give you enough time to clean up anything other than quick little messes.</p>
<h3>Bissell &#8211; 33A1C</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20576" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bissell-33A1C.jpg" alt="Bissell - 33A1C" width="2000" height="1335" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bissell-Eraser-Handheld-Vacuum-Corded/dp/B001EYFQ28/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissell &#8211; 33A1C</a> is one of the most highly rated handheld vacuums on Amazon. The majority of reviewers cite the low price, and at $30, it’s absolutely the least expensive of handheld vacuums for pet hair. We found it to be very effective on our dog’s bed; it grabbed up every last hair. However, its rubber-teethed mouth doesn’t really rake up the hair, and we had to go over the bed several times before all the hair was picked up.</p>
<p>It’s corded, so it has limitations as to where you can vacuum. We found the vacuum especially challenging when trying to clean the car, since you need an outlet nearby that can accommodate its cord.</p>
<p>The vent exhaust is close to the head, so for anything other than hair, the exhaust air blows it around. The Bissell’s tapered mouth allows you to vacuum in tight spaces, but the spaces in the rubbered mouth are so small that it really can’t pick up much besides pet hair.</p>
<p>Finally, cleaning the filter is a pain, especially if you have a pet with long hair. The Pet Hair Eraser has a ridged fabric filter, which traps long pet hair and can only be removed by picking it out with your fingers.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>There’s clearly a lot of competition in marketing a vacuum to pet owners, and at first, it can be daunting to decide which type of vacuum you need and then whether it really can do as advertised. You could certainly spend a month’s rent on a very high-end vacuum, but we focused our research and subsequent testing on reasonably priced upright and handheld vacuums that were designed specifically for vacuuming pet hair.</p>
<p>The best upright bagless canister vacuum for pet hair was unquestionably the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Navigator-Lift-Away-Anti-Allergy-NV352-Lavender/dp/B004Q4DRJW/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shark &#8211; NV350</a>. Its swivel steering and motorized beater brush give this lightweight vacuum excellent maneuverability, so you can get under furniture and into tight corners. The Shark &#8211; NV350 has a dual air filtration system with a HEPA filter, which eliminates virtually every speck of dust and dander on your carpets and floors. It also has a canister that can be removed to transform it into a portable vacuum that’s perfect for going up and down stairs.</p>
<p>Our pick for the best handheld vacuum for pet hair is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-Cordless-SMARTECH-Scent/dp/B06XHJGH69/?tag=ybdvac-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; HHVJ325BMP07</a>. It’s a cordless handheld and its charge lasts 18 minutes, giving you plenty of time for rapid clean up of small areas.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to evaluate</h2>
<p>Pet insurance is a mixed breed that straddles human health care and property insurance. As a fairly new industry, it can be a confusing topic. We turned to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association (NAPHIA) for guidance. NAPHIA aims to improve pet insurance standards as well as public awareness. We learned from NAPHIA that there are roughly a dozen pet insurers that cover the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Our research began by looking at consumer ratings on third-party review sites such as Pet Insurance Review and PetInsuranceQuotes.com (recently acquired by Petco). We read pro tips from veterinarians like Dr. Doug Kenney at PetInsuranceGuides.com and Dr. Frances Wilkerson at Pet Insurance University. In-depth reviews on Wirecutter and Reviews.com further rounded out our study.</p>
<p>We next analyzed the types of insurance plans offered by each company. Every insurer takes a different approach. Most include more than one plan type. We picked through websites page by page, gleaned missing info from FAQs and downloaded sample policies to get into the details.</p>
<p>Boned up on fundamentals, we narrowed down our finalists to only include plans that cover both illness and injury, known in the insurance world as a “comprehensive plan.” To further cull the group, we eliminated all plans that capped the dollar amount the insurer would cover; having an “unlimited” payout ensures your pet will be covered for whatever emergency comes up.</p>
<p>This process eliminated common brands like Petfirst and Embrace Pet Insurance. Lastly, we identified companies backed by the same underwriter (essentially same policy, just different branding) and went forward with the ones that had the more favorable customer reviews.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-insurance">Who needs pet insurance?</h2>
<p>Pets have moved from sleeping in the barnyard to the backyard to the foot of the bed — or, for some of us animal lovers, with their heads on the pillows. During our research phase, we came upon one subreddit post that summarizes it well: “If you are the kind of pet owner who would spare no expense for your pet’s health, pet insurance is an absolute must.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://naphia.org/industry/research-and-reports/state-of-the-industry-report/naphia-state-of-the-industry-report-highlights-download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAPHIA’s 2018 State of the Industry Report</a>, pet insurance in the US doubled in size between 2013-2018, growing from a $500M industry to just over a $1B industry. This rapid growth has outpaced the industry’s ability to educate consumers. As noted among the 100 pet insurance facts compiled by PetInsuranceQuotes.com, the number one reason people buy pet insurance is because they “want to make decisions about their pet&#8217;s health care without worrying about whether or not they can afford treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>That last point emphasizes the true value of pet insurance: peace of mind. Though some plans pay exam fees, the main benefit of health insurance is to cover high-cost, unexpected illnesses and injuries. A solid policy means you won’t need to worry about draining your savings account or euthanizing your pet because you can’t pay the vet costs, a dreadful situation known as “economic euthanasia.”</p>
<p>There’s a prevailing mindset, advanced by pet insurance companies like Trupanion and Healthy Paws, that you shouldn’t use pet insurance to pay for routine care. In fact, most pet insurers exclude preventive care from their plans. It’s the unforeseen, expensive care you need to guard against, such as the following high-cost claims (this info is taken from Trupanion&#8217;s testimonials page and Healthy Paws&#8217; home page).</p>
<h3>Sample coverage of high-cost claims</h3>
[table id=180 /]
<p>It’s best to enroll your pets while they are young. Most insurers let you enroll as early as eight weeks. Not only does that get you the lowest rates, it also provides the best chance your pet won’t be diagnosed with a pre-existing condition that won’t be covered (more on that below). Most insurers let you begin enrollment around seven to eight weeks old.</p>
<p>Pet insurance is also a wise investment for people who own purebred dogs or cats. By comparison, mixed breeds have more diverse bloodlines that make them hardier. Purebreds, on the other hand, are more susceptible to certain high-risk conditions. Before enrolling your purebred, talk to your vet about which diseases your breed might be predisposed to, then make sure those conditions are covered by your prospective insurer.</p>
<h3>How much should I expect to pay?</h3>
<p>NAPHIA’s 2018 State of the Industry Report indicates dog owners paid an average annual premium of $536 in 2017 for accident-and-illness plans; cat owners averaged $336. That equates to about $45 for a dog’s monthly premium and $28 per month for a cat. The report shows premiums have increased on average at about 6 percent per year 2013-2017.</p>
<p>We spoke with Kristen Lynch, executive director of NAPHIA, and learned one reason premiums increase is due to advances in vet technology. New devices enable veterinarians to perform more sophisticated procedures; these improvements cost money, which is in turn passed on to policyholders in the form of higher premiums. That’s the trade-off for access to better treatment — and when your pet is on the operating table, what pet parent doesn’t want them to have the best care they can get?</p>
<h3>Is pet insurance worth the investment?</h3>
<p>That’s precisely the question Consumer Reports tried to answer in <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/pet-products/is-pet-insurance-worth-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a>. As pointed out in their review, it’s an incredibly tough question to answer because every pet has potential to suffer different conditions. An indoor, mixed-breed cat is less likely to need vet care than an active purebred dog who’s bloodline is subject to hip ailments. Your vet can advise you on how likely your specific breed is to develop a costly chronic condition, but there’s no guarantee that any breed won’t develop cancer. Per that CR article, it’s about “playing the odds”.</p>
<p>And odds are you may never see a return on the monthly premiums you pay out. However, what you’re really investing in is peace of mind from knowing your pet will receive essential vet care should the need arise. That’s really no different than insurance for people: In the United States, we pay enormous premiums for health coverage, but we never actually hope to suffer a stroke or heart attack so that all those monthly payments will zero out.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re one of the unlucky few whose pet requires ongoing care, such as for cancer or diabetes, then your investment will more than pay for itself. That’s how insurance systems work: Many people pay into the system so that those few who actually need treatment will be covered.</p>

<p><b>Types of insurance policies, rates and covered conditions vary widely between insurers.</b> The three common policy types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comprehensive:</b> These plans cover both illness and injury. Since you can’t predict which conditions will affect your pet over their lifetime, this is the safest, most inclusive coverage you can get. Premiums cost more, but you also get a lot more.</li>
<li><b>Injury-only: </b>Sometimes labeled “Accident-only,” these plans only cover physical injury to your pet. Monthly premiums are much less than for comprehensive plans, but so is your coverage. You might consider an injury-only policy if you’re on a tight budget and have an energetic pet who likes to explore hazardous situations.</li>
<li><b>Wellness-only: </b>These plans cover routine exams as well as preventive care such as vaccinations, flea and tick control, deworming and dental.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some insurers offer only of these plan types, and few insurers offer all three. Here’s a snapshot of how each type can vary in price.</p>
<h3>Sample plans and pricing for 3-year-old mixed-breed dog</h3>
[table id=181 /]
<p>Although the lower-cost accident-only and wellness plans may seem appealing, coverage is substantially less. Consumers appear to grasp the value of going the comprehensive route. NAPHIA reports that in 2017 an overwhelming 98 percent of U.S. pet owners chose to purchase comprehensive policies; only two percent opted for accident-only plans. Of the three bulleted policy types above, only comprehensive plans cover both illness and injury/accident, making it the plan type we recommend.</p>
<p>Many insurers offer supplemental wellness care on top of their base comprehensive plans. These add-ons, called <i>riders</i>, tack on coverage for preventive, behavioral or naturopathic treatments. Monthly premiums increase by about $25. In our opinion, it’s better to forego these riders. You’ll need to pay for routine care, but the money you save in reduced premiums (about $300/year) should easily cover annual vet exams and routine care.</p>
<h3>What pet insurance covers</h3>
<p><i>Benefits</i> are the specific types of vet care for which you are insured and will be reimbursed. Comprehensive insurance policies help pay for the vast majority of ailments and injuries, and may extend to certain types of preventive care such as vaccinations. It all depends on what’s listed in your policy. To gain that essential peace of mind, a good insurance policy covers at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic conditions such as cancer and diabetes</li>
<li>Hereditary and congenital conditions</li>
<li>Surgeries and hospitalization</li>
<li>MRI or CT scans, X-rays, ultrasounds and lab tests</li>
<li>Vet-prescribed medications</li>
</ul>
<p>Most insurers only cover dogs and cats. The one exception is Nationwide’s Avian &amp; Exotic Pet Plan, which covers animals such as birds, rabbits, turtles and snakes. Yes, they even cover iguanas and potbellied pigs.</p>
<p>With any policy, the common stipulation is that your pet must receive care from a licensed veterinarian. However, unlike health insurance for people, most plans let you choose your preferred vet.</p>
<h3>What it doesn’t cover</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the big one. No pet insurance company covers “pre-existing conditions.” If your vet records list a previous illness or injury, or if your vet discovers an issue during an enrollment exam, the insurer will not cover that condition should it recur. This is especially relevant to older pets that are more likely to have experienced an issue in the past.</p>
<p>When you analyze a sample policy, you’ll find it’s more about what’s listed as “not covered” than covered. Common exclusions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventive care</li>
<li>Spaying or neutering, pregnancy and birthing</li>
<li>Microchipping (your local Humane Society can do this for about $15)</li>
<li>Special foods, dietary supplements or vitamins</li>
<li>Behavioral training or therapy</li>
</ul>

The <i>quote</i> is the estimated cost you will need to pay each month. Additionally, most insurers let you download a <i>sample policy</i> that details your contractual relationship. Use this research to select an insurance company, referred to as your <i>insurer</i>.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Enroll your pet.</b><br />
Assuming your pet meets age requirements, submit all required paperwork — and be sure to thoroughly review your official policy. Your insurer will obtain medical records (if they exist) from your preferred veterinarian, referred to as your <i>provider</i>. Some companies also require a vet exam to enroll.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Pay your monthly premium.</b><br />
The <i>premium</i> is the dollar amount you owe your insurer each month. Most companies let you set up automatic payment from your bank.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Pay your next vet bill.</b><br />
At your next vet appointment, you need to cover all vet fees out of your own pocket (such as by debit or credit card). This is the case whether or not your insurer covers the specific type of vet care received. For covered treatments, you will be reimbursed later.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Meet your deductible.</b><br />
The <i>deductible</i> is the dollar-amount threshold you must pay before your insurer begins paying any vet fees. It only applies to covered conditions. Once you meet your deductible, the insurer covers the majority of all costs for the rest of that year. This remains in effect until start of following year when the deductible resets to zero and you must again reach the threshold before coverage kicks in.</p>
<p><b>Step 6: Pay your co-pay percentage.</b><br />
After you meet your deductible, you are still responsible for a <i>co-pay</i> portion of the total vet bill. This ranges from 10-30 percent. Your insurer covers the remaining cost, referred to as the <i>reimbursement percentage</i> (usually 70-90 percent). You must submit your co-pay for each covered condition for the rest of the given year.</p>
<p><b>Step 7: Submit a claim to your insurer.</b><br />
Send a copy of your vet receipt to the pet insurance company. Many insurers have mobile apps that let you upload a photo of the receipt. Most also allow you to send by email, regular mail or even by fax.</p>
<p><b>Step 8: Receive reimbursement.</b><br />
The insurer reviews and processes your claim. Once approved, your insurer issues reimbursement (by check or direct deposit) to cover your out-of-pocket expenses. Depending on the company, claims processing can range from a few to over 30 days.</p>
<p>A key takeaway from above is that pet insurance operates as a reimbursement system. Unlike people’s health insurance, the system works similar to auto insurance, another form of property/casualty insurance. At the time of your vet appointment, you pay the full vet bill from your own bank account or credit card, then the insurer pays you back (less the co-pay, of course). If you find yourself facing a very expensive vet bill, don’t despair — try looking into one of these financial aid resources posted by the <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/trouble_affording_veterinary_care.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humane Society</a>.</p>
<h3>Getting your first quote</h3>
<p>All of our finalists’ websites offer online quote calculators that are simple, fast and intuitive to use. This is an invaluable tool for comparing quotes between insurers. Each site requires you to enter an email address. We worried about being deluged with endless pesky emails, but it honestly wasn’t that bad, and you can unsubscribe at any time.</p>
<p><b>First, enter your pet’s information.</b> These factors will set the baseline cost. If you want to insure more than one pet, you’ll have that option later.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pet type:</b> Select dog or cat. Dog premiums cost one-third to twice as much as cats.</li>
<li><b>Gender:</b> Select male or female. When we ran our quotes, we did not see any cost difference for male versus female.</li>
<li><b>Age:</b> Your insurer will use the birth date listed on pet’s medical records. If you don’t have any records, most insurers will use your vet’s best estimate.</li>
<li><b>Breed:</b> Each site has a lengthy drop-down list of purebreds. You can also select “mixed breed,” in which case you might be prompted to specify your pet’s size.</li>
<li><b>Zip code:</b> Your pet must reside with you at this address.</li>
<li><b>Email:</b> You need to enter this info to advance to the quote screen.</li>
</ul>

Next, adjust variables to estimate your monthly premium. This is the crux of the matter — determining how much you will need to pay per month. While options vary by insurer (as is the case with all things in the insurance world), there are three main variables. Most insurers let you customize these settings.</p>
<p><b>(1) Annual limit:</b> This is maximum amount your insurer will pay out each year. It typically starts at $5K and maxes out at $15k or $20K. Or you can go the “Unlimited” route and rest assured you’ll be covered for anything that comes up.</p>
<ul>
<li>A higher annual limit increases your monthly premium, but you’ll be covered for expensive treatments (especially if you go Unlimited).</li>
<li>A lower annual limit reduces your premium, but you’ll be on the hook for any vet fees that exceed your limit.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(2) Annual deductible:</b> This is the amount you must pay before coverage from your insurer kicks in. It typically ranges from $100 to $500, though some go up to $1,000.</p>
<ul>
<li>A lower annual deductible increases your monthly premium, but if your pet needs treatment you&#8217;ll pay less to reach your deductible, at which point your insurer begins covering vet costs.</li>
<li>A higher annual deductible reduces your monthly premium, but you’ll pay more out-of-pocket vet fees each year to reach your threshold.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(3) Reimbursement percent:</b> Think of this as your co-pay. For example, if you choose 80-percent reimbursement, you will be responsible for 20 percent of the vet fee. The common options are 70, 80 or 90 percent.</p>
<ul>
<li>A higher reimbursement percent increases your monthly premium, but you&#8217;ll pay less in out-of-pocket co-pay fees.</li>
<li>A lower reimbursement reduces your monthly premium, but your out-of-pocket co-pay fees will cost you more.</li>
</ul>

We encourage you to visit a few sites and give each one a try. It’s remarkably easy to adjust sliders and buttons to find a premium you can afford; watch your monthly premium go up or down as you toggle different options. But there’s more to consider than just the numbers, which we’ll get into next.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Plan eligibility and variables</h3>
[table id=182 /]
<p>Comparing quotes is important, but here are the other critical factors that should shape your decision.</p>
<p><b>Pet’s age: </b>The sooner you start, the lower your premiums (start at age one if possible). If you first enroll your pet when they are age seven to eight, when dogs and cats start to enter their geriatric years, you may find the monthly premiums beyond what you can afford. Many insurers will not enroll pets after they turn 14-years-old.</p>
<p><b>Monthly premium: </b>Take a hard look at your monthly budget and figure how much you can afford to pay. This is really a matter of personal income. Be aware that your monthly premium will likely increase a bit each year. This is due to (1) rising costs of vet care, and (2) some companies raise premiums as pets grow older and more susceptible to illness.</p>
<p><b>Policy document:</b> The official policy specifies the legal terms and conditions of your contract. Fortunately, most insurers avoid too much legalese and instead use language that’s easy to understand. Be sure to dissect every paragraph. If there’s anything you don’t understand, don’t hesitate to contact customer support.</p>
<p><b>“Exclusions” and “limitations”: </b>These two policy sections require very close scrutiny.. Exclusions are conditions that aren’t covered at all. Limitations impose restrictions. Since the primary value of pet insurance is to cover high-cost treatments, be sure you are fully covered for these big-ticket issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Chronic conditions: </b>This type of care is ongoing from year to year, including cancer and diabetes. That means costs can really add up. Never accept restrictions on chronic disorders.</li>
<li><b>Hereditary conditions: </b>These genetic disorders are passed down bloodlines. This coverage is most important for purebreds. Hip dysplasia, epilepsy and intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) are common examples.</li>
<li><b>Congenital conditions: </b>These are issues that your pet developed in utero (i.e., pre-birth). Examples include heart disease, nervous system issues, cataracts and liver disease.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Maximum payout:</b> This is a type of limitation you need watch out for. We strongly recommend you avoid plans that include any of the following payment cutoffs.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lifetime limit:</b> This is the maximum amount the insurer will pay out over the lifetime of your pet. Once you hit the dollar amount threshold, the insurer stops reimbursing costs and your policy will be terminated.</li>
<li><b>Per Incident limit:</b> This is the max amount your insurer will pay out for a specific illness or injury. Once you reach the limit, they will no longer issue reimbursement for that specific condition, though you will still be covered for other issues. We eliminated AKC’s “Companion Plus” plan due to this provision (a rep told us they may soon be getting rid of this limit).</li>
<li><b>Benefits schedule:</b> This is a line-item list of covered conditions along with the max amount the insurer will pay for each one. These price limits are supposed to be based on typical medical costs, but there’s no way to guarantee how much your vet will actually charge. Avoid this claims structure. For example, Nationwide’s “Whole Pet with Wellness” is a good comprehensive plan, but their “Major Medical” plan uses a benefits schedule that we recommend you steer clear of.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Waiting period</h3>
[table id=183 /]
<p><b>Wait periods: </b>Think of this as a probation period. The clock begins ticking down starting from the day of your enrollment. If your pet acquires an illness or injury during this time, it will be considered pre-existing and that specific condition will not be covered. There are two types of wait periods, and each varies per insurer: illness (1-30 days) and injury/accident (1-15 days). Many insurers impose longer wait periods for hip and knee conditions. Look for the terms “hip dysplasia” and “cruciate ligament” or “patella” in your policy. These special wait periods can extend from six up to 12 months.</p>
<p><b>Location: </b>Urban areas cost more than rural areas, which reflects the cost of vet care in different regions. Also, plans vary by state because insurers need to have their policies legally approved by each state’s regulatory boards. When you review a sample policy, make sure it applies to the state where you live.</p>
<p><b>Discounts: </b>Most every insurer offers some form of discount. A multipet discount for two or more animals is most common and usually set at 5 percent. Some offer a savings if you pay your premium annually rather than monthly. Others apply a discount if your pet is spayed/neutered or if you have military status.</p>
<p><b>Claims process: </b>Once you pay your vet bill, you want to receive reimbursement quickly and painlessly. Most insurers offer a mobile app that lets you upload a photo of your vet bill. Under 10 days is a good timeframe for reimbursement, but some insurers take up to 30 days. To help speed things up, take advantage of direct deposit, now offered by many companies.</p>
<p><b>Customer Support:</b> During our research phase, we found all our finalists’ support staff to be friendly and knowledgeable. Wait times were short. Some insurer websites even feature live chat to field quick questions. Once you narrow down your insurers, it’s worth taking the time to read consumer reviews on <a href="https://www.petinsurancereview.com/insurers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet Insurance Review</a> to hear what others are saying.</p>
<h3>Can I change insurers?</h3>
<p>You are free to switch to another company — but it’s not recommended. First, any issues recorded in your pet’s medical records will be deemed “pre-existing conditions” by your new insurer and therefore will not be covered. Second, you will essentially be starting new; if your pet is older (especially if beyond age 7), expect your monthly premium to increase significantly. A waiting period also applies anew.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-evaluated">How we evaluated</h2>
<h3>Consumer review scores</h3>
[table id=184 /]
<p>Since it’s not realistic to acquire pet insurance from each company and then test for many years, we looked at consumer reviews on five popular websites: Pet Insurance Review, Trustpilot, ConsumersAdvocate.org, Canine Journal and PetInsuranceQuotes.com. In addition to the scores, we scanned to learn what people find most important.</p>
<p>As we combed through customer reviews, the number one complaint was being denied coverage by claim departments. Many gripes seem legit, but it also appears a lot of people don’t understand their policy. It’s critical to know your annual limit, how preventive care applies and which treatments aren’t covered due to any specific exclusions or limitations.</p>
<p>Healthy Paws consistently received the highest customer reviews across all four sites. Trupanion is also highly reviewed on two of the four sites. Coming in with fewer positive reviews, Figo has some catching up to do, but that’s likely because they’re a fairly new company and still building up a customer base.</p>
<h3>Quote comparisons</h3>
<p>To compare apples to apples, we first established our baseline criteria. We used male pets for simplicity (same rate for both genders), set size at medium (for dogs only), located ourselves in San Diego and acquired quotes for four different age groups based on subdividing from the age-13 upper limit. We set our three important variables as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Annual limit: </b>As discussed above, an “unlimited” payout is the only way to ensure you’re covered for those break-the-bank situations.</li>
<li><b>Deductible: </b>We reasoned that our main goal is to be covered for those rare high-cost conditions. So we chose to go with $500 to keep our monthly premiums lower (some deviations noted below).</li>
<li><b>Reimbursement percentage: </b>We saw only a small cost bump ($5-$10/month) to go from 80 to 90 percent. We went with 90 percent to minimize our co-pay.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the charts below, it’s important to point out that these costs are for newly enrolled pets — so if you enroll your pet at age one when your rate will be lowest, expect annual premiums to creep up due to inflation and rising vet costs, but you shouldn’t pay anywhere near the rates for a nine- or 13-year-old dog as shown in these charts. Still, we think these age/rate comparisons are a good reflection of each insurer’s overall pricing.</p>
<p>We should further point out that Nationwide’s &#8211; Whole Pet with Wellness plan has a set $100 deductible (that’s the only option). Also, Healthy Paws uses fixed rates for pet age eight and older. You’ll see these noted throughout the charts below.</p>
<h3>Table A: $500 deductible for mixed-breed dog (medium size) in San Diego</h3>
[table id=185 /]
<p>Mixed-breed dogs and cats are less prone to genetic ailments, which translates to lower premiums. The mixed-breed category serves as our benchmark for comparing others.</p>
<p>Right away, you can see how much less expensive rates are if you enroll your pet when it’s young. Again, rates increase over time, but if you enroll your dog at age one, your premium shouldn’t jump up to the cost shown for a five-year-old in the above chart.</p>
<p>Pets Best &#8211; BestBenefit Plus Plan and Healthy Paws offer the lowest rates. On the high end, Figo leads off with priciest rates but is surpassed by Petplan as dogs enroll at more senior ages. ASPCA &#8211; Complete Coverage is the midrange low and Trupanion is the midrange high.</p>
<p>To get a fuller perspective, we also ran quotes for a $250 deductible with all other criteria set the same. See chart below.</p>
<h3>Table B: $250 deductible for mixed-breed dog (medium size) in San Diego</h3>
[table id=192 /]
<p>Again, you need to pay vet costs out of pocket until you meet your deductible, at which point the insurer covers all costs except your co-pay. You’ll reach the threshold faster with a lower deductible, but monthly premiums are higher. Comparing rates for a $250 versus $500 deductible, costs range $10-$15 higher at age one; after that, they escalate considerably. We think a $500 deductible is more affordable for the average consumer.</p>
<h3>Table C: $500 deductible for mixed-breed cat in San Diego</h3>
[table id=193 /]
<p>Compared to dogs, pet insurance for cats is much less expensive. Premiums range from two-thirds the cost to lower than half as much. As with mixed-breed dogs, <a href="http://pets-best-pet-insurance.evyy.net/c/1341923/185910/2424" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pets Best</a> and <a href="http://www.healthypawspetinsurance.com/?affid=RH05745" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Healthy Paws</a> come in on the low end. Petplan, Trupanion and Figo make up the high end.</p>
<h3>Table D: $500 deductible for purebred American bulldog in San Diego</h3>
[table id=194 /]
<p>Purebred dogs and cats are <a href="https://naphia.org/news/breeds-with-the-best-pet-insurance-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more predisposed to hereditary disorders</a>, and that’s reflected in each company’s higher rates. We selected five popular breeds known to have health issues: Cocker Spaniel, German Shepherd, American Bulldog, Rottweiler and Basset Hound. Our bulldog quote fell midrange, so that’s the one we’ve shared here.</p>
<p>For our five purebred categories, ASPCA just barely edged out Pets Best for lowest monthly premiums. Petplan and Figo were both substantially more for all five breeds, and in some cases were over three times as much as the lowest rates.</p>
<h3>Table E: $500 deductible for purebred British shorthair in San Diego</h3>
[table id=195 /]
<p>We ran quotes for five feline purebreds: Persian, Maine Coon, British Shorthair (shown here), Abyssinian and Manx. Pets Best delivered notably lower rates across the board. Healthy Paws and ASPCA jockeyed for second place. Similar to purebred dogs, Petplan and Figo were significantly more expensive.</p>
<h3>Table F: $1,000 deductible for mixed-breed Dog (medium) in San Diego</h3>
[table id=196 /]
<p>Termed “catastrophic” coverage by some insurers, this approach sets your deductible at the upper limit. The idea is to greatly reduce your monthly premiums, but still have unlimited coverage for major illnesses or injuries. If you’re on a tight budget, you may find this an affordable option.</p>
<p>Of our finalists, only Trupanion, Pets Best and Petplan let you set a $1,000 deductible. Pets Best again offers lowest monthly rates. Trupanion follows not far behind. Petplan starts at twice the cost of Pets Best and only goes up from there.<b></b></p>
<h3>Table G: Comprehensive+wellness, $500 deductible for mixed-breed dog</h3>
[table id=197 /]
<p>If you’re the type of pet owner who really wants to optimize their pet’s well-being by sticking to annual exams and pushing preventive care, consider a wellness add-on. But be advised that tacking on a wellness rider will bump up your rates by roughly $25 per month. Over the course of year, that adds up to around $300; by contrast, a vet exam plus routine vaccines should cost under $100 (at time of this publication, it’s about $90 in San Diego). That’s why many pet owners elect to go with basic comprehensive coverage and pay for annual vet visits out of pocket.</p>
<p>Only Pets Best, Nationwide and ASPCA offer a comprehensive/wellness combo. Riding toward the middle of the pack thus far, Nationwide’s &#8211; Whole Pet with Wellness surges to the front in this category. This is the only plan they offer that has an unlimited annual payout, and it happens to come packaged with a full suite of wellness care. Take a look at their <a href="https://www.petinsurance.com/enroll/Files/Whole_Pet_with_wellness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">covered care summary</a>. Considering it comes with a low $100 deductible that applies to other non-wellness treatments, this combo plan delivers incredible value.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.healthypawspetinsurance.com/?affid=RH05745" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Healthy Paws</a> uses one simple plan structure. Their single policy type is set at unlimited annual payout, so there’s no dollar cap to confuse new customers. All you need to do is pick your annual deductible ($100, $250 or $500) and co-pay (70, 80 or 90 percent). While they don’t offer a multipet discount, you can get reduced rates if you are a member of AAA, AARP or Costco.</p>
<p>When we spoke with Healthy Paws co-founder and CEO Rob Jackson, he emphasized the company’s goal is to provide a comprehensive plan that’s easy for consumers to understand. Rob shared their motto is “One plan. Four paws. All covered.” That straightforward approach is reflected in their policy, which uses plain language and isn’t bogged down with jargon and legalese.</p>
<p>In terms of cost, Healthy Paws offers some of the lowest monthly premiums on the market. As with most plans, the sooner you enroll, the lower your rate will be. Pets must be at least eight weeks old to enroll. Be aware that Healthy Paws does not cover hip dysplasia for pets that begin coverage after they turn six years old.</p>

Four paws. All covered.” They offer a comprehensive plan that’s easy for new customers to understand. Their low rates, hassle-free claims process and near-perfect customer feedback make Healthy Paws our top dog.</p><a href="http://www.healthypawspetinsurance.com/?affid=RH05745" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Healthy Paws</button></a></div></div>
<p>Like our other finalists, Healthy Paws covers all major illnesses and injuries; hereditary and congenital conditions; chronic conditions like cancer; plus diagnostic treatment, surgery and hospitalization. They also pay for prescription medications and cover “alternative care” for acupuncture, chiropractic and hydrotherapy at no extra cost, where some insurers require a wellness add-on.</p>
<p>To keep rates low, Healthy Paws doesn’t cover preventive care, which applies to vaccinations, flea control, heartworm medication, deworming, nail trimming, dental cleaning, spaying or neutering. Nor do they cover exam fees, even for covered conditions; that’s unfortunate, but tolerable if it keeps premiums affordable.</p>
<p>Healthy Paws earned the highest customer scores on all five review sites that we researched. We really can’t undervalue the hefty number of glowingly positive customer reviews. With over 4,200 reviews on <a href="https://www.petinsurancereview.com/insurers/healthy-paws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pet Insurance Review</a>, a 9.8 score is fairly astounding. Customers praise the staff’s communication, hassle-free claims process and speedy payment.</p>
<p>There are a few specific limitations you should be aware of. First, newly enrolled pets must have a one-time pet exam, which helps identify any pre-existing conditions. Second, Healthy Paws applies a lengthy 12-month wait period for hip dysplasia, a common ailment for dog breeds such as Labrador retrievers. This type of hip disease can be common in dogs under age one, so talk to your vet about the risks before enrolling.</p>
<p>Healthy Paws also limits plan options for older pets. If you enroll your pet after their eighth birthday, you still get unlimited coverage, but you’re forced to go with a $750 annual deductible and your co-pay is set at 40 percent. That can be a big cost hit if your vet bill climbs into five digits. Still, if you compare other insurers’ rates for newly enrolling older pets, Healthy Paws’ premiums are the only ones most people can afford.</p>
<p>According to the Healthy Paws home page, they process 99 percent of claims in just two days. You can easily submit a claim by uploading a photo of your vet bill through their mobile app. Reimbursement typically takes three to 10 days. Their support department let us know they once paid out $60,000 to cover a single claim.</p>
<p>Aside from the wait period hurdles you need to navigate, the Healthy Paws plan is all positives. It’s not hard to see why they score so high in both consumer and professional reviews.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Healthy Paws&#8217; single plan option is straightforward and policy language is easy to understand.</li>
<li>Premiums are lower than most other insurers, especially if you enroll while your pet is young.</li>
<li>Healthy Paws has the highest customer scores on all major pet insurance review websites, reporting stellar service and quick claim payments.</li>
<li>For new enrollees, there is a lengthy 12-month wait period for hip dysplasia.</li>
<li>Pets that enroll at age 8 or older must use a fixed plan with only 60 percent reimbursement (40-percent co-pay).</li>

<p>In our quote research, the <a href="http://pets-best-pet-insurance.evyy.net/c/1341923/185910/2424" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pets Best &#8211; BestBenefit Plus Plan</a> repeatedly delivered the lowest monthly premiums of all seven contenders. A good plan is not all about price, but it’s certainly an important factor. With all the different categories we ran quotes for, we put our finalists to the test and were surprised by Pets Best’s consistently low rates.</p>
<p>Pets Best was founded by Dr. Jack Stephens, who back in 1981 helped launch the first pet insurance company in North America. As a practicing veterinarian, Dr. Stephens recognized how tragic it is for pet parents to have to put their animals down simply because they couldn’t afford treatment. As a result, the Pets Best mission is to end economic euthanasia. That helps explain why their rates are so affordable.</p>
<p>Regarding plan structure, Pets Best offers three different plans, but they are very similar. The mid-tier “Plus” plan adds coverage for exam fees associated with an eligible illness or injury (not included with their basic “Essential” plan). And the top-tier “Elite” plan further adds on rehab for special care like acupuncture or chiropractic. We went with the “Plus” plan for solid coverage at reasonable rates.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://pets-best-pet-insurance.evyy.net/c/1341923/185910/2424" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pets-best-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pets-best-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pets-best-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pets-best-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pets-best-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pets-best-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pets-best-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pets-best-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pets-best-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Lowest Rates: Pets Best - BestBenefit Plus Plan</h3><p>Across the board, Pets Best offers the lowest rates we could find for both mixed breeds and purebreds. Plans are highly customizable, and this mid-tier plan also reimburses for exam fees associated with a covered condition, a bonus not offered by all insurers.</p><a href="http://pets-best-pet-insurance.evyy.net/c/1341923/185910/2424" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Pets Best</button></a></div></div>
<p>Pets Best offers lots of flexibility to set your annual deductible and reimbursement percentage — just be sure to select the “Unlimited” annual limit. Though we prefer to pay for annual exams out of pocket, Pets Best does offer two different wellness add-ons, priced around $15-$25, that cover annual exams and preventive care. As an additional option, they provide a 5-percent multipet discount if you have more than one pet.</p>
<p>Wait periods are reasonable at 14 days for illness coverage and just three days for injury. The exception is cruciate ligament conditions, which have an extended six-month waiting period that cannot be waived by exam.</p>
<p>Pets Best touts that they process most claims in just three to five days. They also offer direct deposit, plus a “Vet Direct Pay” option. Once you submit paperwork for payment directly to your vet, that provider will remain on file for the next time you need to pay vet fees.</p>
<p>With all the (good features/positives), we might have considered Pets Best for our top pick were it not for some mixed customer reviews. Comments on Pet Insurance Review and Trustpilot are largely on the positive side. But Pets Best didn’t score nearly the same rave reviews as Healthy Paws, which led us to rank them a runner-up, still a very solid showing.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Pets Best &#8211; BestBenefit Plus Plan consistently yielded the lowest monthly premiums when we ran our quote comparisons.</li>
<li>Highly customizable plans, including a midrange “Plus” plan that covers exam fees for covered conditions, which some other insurers exclude.</li>
<li>Most quotes are processed in a quick three- to five-day turnaround time.</li>
<li>Wait period is extended to six months for cruciate ligament conditions.</li>
<li>Pets Best receives mostly positive reviews, though some customers complain about arguing with their claims department over whether their pet’s condition is covered.</li>

<p>Among our finalists, <a href="https://www.petinsurance.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nationwide’s &#8211; Whole Pet with Wellness</a> plan is unique in that it combines comprehensive with wellness care. It’s also Nationwide’s only plan that uses an unlimited payout. The extra benefit means you’re not going to get the lowest rates, but you do get a lot of bang for your buck.</p>
<p>Be sure not to confuse this “Whole Pet” plan with Nationwide’s “Major Medical” — that plan uses a benefits schedule that limits payouts based on line-item pricing (think of it as a menu for each type of treatment). Also, be aware their “Pet Wellness” plan only covers routine exams and preventive care, and not the injuries and illnesses covered by a comprehensive plan.</p>
<p>Once you clear those two hurdles, there is very little that’s confusing about the Whole Pet with Wellness plan. And that simplicity is one of its merits. Rather than choose between deductible and co-pay options, the Whole Pet plan is fixed at an unlimited annual payout, a $100 deductible and a 10-percent co-pay. For a fixed plan, those are very favorable settings.</p>
<p>To hammer that point home, not only do you get to use a low $100 deductible for any illness or injury, you also get a highly inclusive wellness package — routine exams, vaccinations, flea and tick control, dental cleaning, behavioral care, dietary supplements — if you can think of it, it’s probably on <a href="https://www.petinsurance.com/enroll/Files/Whole_Pet_with_wellness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the list</a>.</p>

Whole Pet with Wellness covers the full range of vet fees. And the best part: You get all these benefits at a low $100 deductible.</p><a href="https://www.petinsurance.com" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Nationwide</button></a></div></div>
<p>Considering overall value, Whole Pet monthly premiums are very reasonable. Compared to our other plans at a $500 deductible (and without wellness), Whole Pet falls right in the middle. At a $250 deductible, Whole Pet is as low or less than the competition.</p>
<p>In terms of restrictions, dogs must be at least age 1 and under age 10 to enroll (no such restriction on cats). The wait period is 14 days for both illness and injury. Unlike some other insurers, there are no special wait periods for hip or knee conditions.</p>
<p>Consumer comments on Pet Insurance Review are for the most part complimentary. You need to look closely because the major complaints we saw were all regarding Nationwide’s Major Medical; we agree, that’s not a good option. Other, minor comments suggest that their claim processing should be faster.</p>
<p>As a company, Nationwide has been in business since 1925. Their pet insurance division was originally Veterinary Pet Insurance (VPI) — who, by the way, issued the very first pet policy to Lassie — founded in 1982 and acquired by Nationwide in 2014. With such established history, you can depend on Nationwide to be around for the long run.</p>
<p>When we started this review, we didn’t set out to consider wellness care. Yet, we sure came to appreciate this plan’s value. Nationwide’s Whole Pet with Wellness was another strong contender for our top pick. But we think pet insurance should be affordable by as many pet parents as possible, and that means going with a lower-priced plan that doesn’t attach the extra cost of wellness coverage.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Nationwide &#8211; Whole Pet with Wellness covers the entire range of vet services by combining comprehensive illness and injury with extensive wellness care.</li>
<li>This is the least confusing plan available because all variables are fixed — favorably so: $100 deductible, 10-percent co-pay and unlimited annual payout.</li>
<li>Unlike many other insurers, there are no special wait periods.</li>
<li>As a highly respected company with over 90 years in business, you can count on Nationwide being there for the long run.</li>
<li>This all-encompassing plan can’t compete against the low rates of plans that forego wellness, yet it still delivers incredible value at a reasonable price.</li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly, our research suggests that all of our seven finalists provide great coverage that we would not hesitate to recommend. Put another way, each of these pet insurance companies can provide that essential “peace of mind” from knowing your favorite companion will receive whatever emergency vet care is required, regardless of expense. It really comes down to the fine details and the fact that some insurers’ rates are higher than others.</p>
<h3>Trupanion</h3>
<p><a href="http://trupanion.sjv.io/c/1341923/503468/8654" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Trupanion</a> led the way in offering a streamlined plan that helps prevent customers getting overwhelmed. Their one policy comes with unlimited annual payout and 10-percent co-pay. You just need to choose your deductible, which can be set at one-dollar increments from $0-$1,000.</p>
<p>Trupanion is the only company that uses a “per incident” deductible: For each condition your pet develops, you pay vet fees up to your deductible; once you meet the threshold, that condition is covered for the life of your pet, though you’re still responsible for the co-pay. The risk is that you may have to pay multiple deductibles if you have an unlucky or accident-prone pet who requires more than one vet visit.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://trupanion.sjv.io/c/1341923/503468/8654" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/trupanion-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/trupanion-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/trupanion-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/trupanion-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/trupanion-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/trupanion-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/trupanion-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/trupanion-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/trupanion-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Most Innovative Claim Structure: Trupanion</h3><p>If your pet first comes down with an ailment while covered by Trupanion, the company’s unique “per incident” deductible covers treatment for that specific condition for the life of your pet. Customers also report that Trupanion is quick to issue reimbursement.</p><a href="http://trupanion.sjv.io/c/1341923/503468/8654" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Trupanion</button></a></div></div>
<p>Another unique feature is Trupanion’s “Vet Direct Pay” system. Trupanion pioneered the way for paying vets directly. This minimizes your out out-of-pocket expenses. Most other companies now also offer direct pay, but they make you do the legwork to process a “veterinarian release form.” Trupanion runs a dedicated software system connected to vet offices. Vets need to opt into the system, but once they do Trupanion can issue payment within minutes of your checkout.</p>
<p>According to Trupanion’s website, they settle 65 percent of claims on same day received, and 80 percent within seven days. Another plus is that they don’t require any special extended wait periods. In reviewing Trupanion’s policy doc, we noted your pet needs to receive required vaccinations or they won’t be covered for those specific conditions.</p>
<p>Trupanion’s reviews are nearly as high as Healthy Paws on Pet Insurance Review and slightly less favorable on Trustpilot. Founded in 2000, Trupanion has built a strong reputation. With all their innovative features, we were inclined to push them into the winner’s circle. But when we compared quotes, Trupanion frequently came in third most expensive. If rates were lower, they’d surely be a contender.</p>
<h3>ASPCA &#8211; Complete Coverage</h3>
<p>Formerly the Hartville Pet Insurance Group, this Crum &amp; Forster company formed a strategic partnership in 2006 with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). Similar to Pets Best, their plan is highly customizable. The <a href="https://www.aspcapetinsurance.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ASPCA &#8211; Complete Coverage</a> plan also offers very reasonable rates, coming in third place just behind Pets Best and Healthy Paws.</p>
<p>ASPCA is one of our few finalists to pay for vet exams that are part of diagnosing a covered condition. Wait periods are short and there are no special extensions for hip or knee conditions. They also cover vet-prescribed medications and foods needed to treat an ailment.</p>
<p>Other insurers offer a multipet discount at 5 percent (if they offer it at all), but ASPCA provides customers a 10-percent discount for enrolling more than one pet. That’s a nice perk if you’re wrangling a small herd of beagles.</p>
<p>ASPCA has a good ranking on Pet Insurance Review and an even better score on Trustpilot where it’s second only to our top pick, Healhy Paws. We honestly have nothing bad to report about ASPCA. The only reason they’re not one of our top picks is that they didn’t stand out in certain categories like others.</p>
<h3>Figo</h3>
<p>Started in 2015, Figo is a newcomer to the scene. They offer three comprehensive plans, but only the <a href="https://figopetinsurance.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Figo &#8211; Ultimate</b></a> plan offers unlimited annual payout. Unlike other companies, Figo’s deductible options vary by age: $100-$750 for pets eight weeks to five years; $250-$1,000 for pets aged six to nine years; and $500-$1,500 for pets 10 years and older.</p>
<p>Figo imposes short wait periods of five days for accidents/injuries and 14 days for illnesses. The exception is cruciate and patella (knee) injuries, which have a six-month wait period; however, that requirement can be waived if a vet examines your pet within the first 30 days and confirms no pre-existing condition.</p>
<p>On the downside, Figo yielded the second highest premiums for most of our quote categories. Only Petplan came in higher. Figo also offers an add-on to cover exam fees — but this only applies to covered illnesses and injuries, and not to routine exams or preventive care. We think there are better options out there.</p>
<h3>Petplan</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGRUxKR0JGTUpHR0xCRkhLR05K" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Petplan</a> offers a high degree of customization. However, when we ran our quotes, we found Petplan consistently had the highest monthly premiums. Some rates were two-to-three times as much as lower-cost competitors, especially for older pets.</p>
<p>Another drawback, Petplan is our only finalist to require an annual vet checkup and dental exam (plus any specific periodic treatment “suggested” by vet to prevent illness or injury). Failure to have an annual checkup means that any new conditions discovered at next vet exam will be used as a basis for pre-existing conditions, for which you will not be covered.</p>
<p>Petplan has decent customer reviews and over 40 years in business, but the above issues led us to steer clear of picking them as a winner.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Pet insurance is one of those rare, pricey things in life that you hope you never need to use. No one wants their pet to get sick or hurt, but it sure is comforting to know you’ll be covered if it happens.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthypawspetinsurance.com/?affid=RH05745" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Healthy Paws</a> gives pet parents peace of mind. Customers applaud their excellent customer service and smooth claims process, which has earned them the highest consumer review scores on both Pet Insurance Review and Trustpilot, Unlike our other finalists, we couldn’t find a single complaint about being denied coverage for a claim.</p>
<p>In terms of rates, Healthy Paws offers some of the lowest monthly premiums available. Just be sure to enroll early, as limitations start to apply after your pet turns six-years-old. We also appreciate their simple plan structure that’s easy to understand and doesn’t overwhelm with numerous decisions to be made.</p>
<p>If lowest rates are your top priority, run a quote for <a href="http://pets-best-pet-insurance.evyy.net/c/1341923/185910/2424" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pets Best &#8211; BestBenefit Plus Plan</a>. You’ll be challenged to find a better monthly premium. Not only does their plan allow a high degree of personalization, but they are our only finalist who that offers both high-deductible plans and wellness add-ons.</p>
<p>If you’re willing to spend a bit more to get more, you can reap the benefits with <a href="https://www.petinsurance.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nationwide’s Whole Pet with Wellness</a>. This plan covers about every vet service you can think of, including all routine exams and all sorts of preventive care. And if you’re looking to insure a feathered friend, <a href="https://www.petinsurance.com/birds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nationwide’s Avian &amp; Exotic Pet Plan</a> is the only policy that covers pets other than dogs and cats.</p>

<h2 id="why-you-need">Why do you need a home security camera system?</h2>
<p>One of the main benefits of having an outdoor camera is safety and peace of mind. Capturing images and videos of an intrusion or disaster can save time and money, especially in the unfortunate case that something happens to your home. Having such footage can provide real evidence to the police, insurance companies or even the wrongfully accused neighbor of not cleaning up after their dog (true story).</p>
<p>During our testing we discovered a more heartwarming and entertaining reason for outdoor cameras: to capture and relive life&#8217;s little moments. We especially appreciated being able to check up on our kids and pets as often as we’d like.</p>
<p>The internet is full of moments captured on outdoor security cameras, some encouraging and others that tell a cautionary tale. We also had our fair share of these moments. The most shocking moment was being able to catch an intoxicated person trying to enter the wrong house, our house! In only a few short minutes, we realized that even in no real danger it is worth every penny to have a camera rolling for peace of mind.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a sped up clip we caught of an inebriated stranger mistakenly trying to access our residence:</p>

<h2 id="how-different">How are self-monitoring systems different?</h2>
<p>There are three major differences between a self-monitoring system and a monitored security system, and it’s important to consider what is best for you and your family.</p>
<p>The first difference is that a traditional monitored system has alarms and signals that will alert the authorities if something happens. On a self-monitored system, no one else is watching your cameras, and the police or fire department are not alerted if something happens when you’re not paying attention to notifications.</p>
<p>The second difference between the two will be the hardware included. Self-monitored systems all watch for motion, but monitored systems typically come with special smoke detectors, open-door alarms, window-opening alerts and a siren. You can assemble similar functionality with a DIY self-monitored system, but making sure it all works together is on you.</p>
<p>Finally, a monitored system will almost always use a telephone hard line or cell phone tower to communicate with a security company, while self-monitored systems rely on your home internet connection and Wi-Fi to update you if something happens. If your Wi-Fi is on the fritz, a self-monitoring wireless camera won’t work. Here’s a quick summary.</p>
<p><b>Monitored security system:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Connected to a police station and fire department</li>
<li>Special hardware for smoke and carbon dioxide detectors</li>
<li>Open window alarms</li>
<li>Hub station with an alarm</li>
<li>Professional installation</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Self-monitored system:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Connects to your smartphone and computer</li>
<li>Alerts you only to motion per your custom settings</li>
<li>Adding other alert hardware can be tricky</li>
<li>Relies on your home internet connection</li>
<li>Subscription fees still a thing, but with different features for your money</li>
</ul>
<p>A great option for renters or an alternative for homeowners is self-monitored systems. Self-monitored cameras still come with motion alerts, link normally to your phone and send messages based on your preferences. As you will find out below, not all cameras are created equal, and some offer options that add to the protection of your home.</p>
<h3>How do self-monitoring home security cameras work?</h3>
<p>Self-monitoring security cameras are connected to your home&#8217;s WiFi router and allow you to monitor a selected space via your smartphone or computer. Installation can be done in less than 30 minutes, including installing the camera in its place and installing the corresponding app on your phone. Once up, it will take a few minutes to get the cameras set just right to include a level of customization that fits your needs.</p>
<p>The next step is to set up notifications that will be sent based on your preferences. Alerts or notifications are sent three ways: via email, text message or push notification. During our testing, we discovered that all three notifications went out at the same time for all cameras. We also found that push notifications were most convenient, as emails and text messages can go unnoticed.</p>

<h2 id="important-hardware-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3><strong>Hardware</strong></h3>
<p><b>Weatherproof: </b>If the goal is to keep a camera outdoors at all times, it needs to be able to do so in all weather and all seasons. For this test, we chose cameras that are waterproof and can function in severe conditions from -4 °F to 130 °F.</p>
<p><b>Motion detection</b><strong>:</strong> It is unlikely that the average person has the time to rewatch videos daily to look for activity. Self-monitoring systems send alarms based on ranges of motion and alert you right away of any activity.</p>
<p><b>Field of view:</b> You will want a camera to be able to capture it all in one frame. You should consider the camera’s degree of view before starting your search. Installing a camera higher to get a wider viewpoint might decrease the clarity of the picture. All cameras we tested have at least a 100-degree field of view.</p>
<p><b>Resolution and zoom</b><strong>:</strong> Resolution is the measurement of pixels of a picture or basically how clear your image will be. Typical resolutions for self-monitored cameras are between 702p and 1080p. It is important to note that when you zoom, you will always lose some quality, but starting with a higher resolution will result in a clearer zoomed shot.</p>
<p><b>Night vision</b><strong>:</strong> Cameras should work for you 24/7 and not just when the sun is out. You will want to make sure your self-monitored camera has a high-resolution <i>night vision</i> camera in addition to the day time camera. For this article, we tested only high-resolution day and night cameras.</p>
<p><b>Audio:</b> Ideally your self-monitored system will have the ability for you to see <i>and </i>listen to what is happening. Some cameras even allow you to talk through the app on your smartphone and be broadcast through the camera.</p>
<p><b>Look and feel</b><strong>:</strong> No one wants their camera to be an eyesore or blatantly obvious. Some are designed with aesthetics in mind. Some people will hide their cameras to capture any unwanted activity around the home, but occasionally just the sight of a camera will deter vandals.</p>
<p><b>Cost: </b>In our testing, we found more expensive doesn’t necessarily mean better. It is important to consider the features you need vs. purchasing based on price.</p>
<h3 id="important-software-features">Software</h3>
<p><b>Mobile app</b><strong>:</strong> Smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives; it’s part of the reason why self-monitored outdoor cameras work so well. Each camera we tested had its own secure app for easy customization, notifications and to view the live video feed. Not to discount the web access, but we found the app was more user-friendly, customizable and accessible.</p>
<p><b>Power and Wi-Fi:</b> Most home Wi-Fi routers can send a signal through the average 2000-square-foot home while being strong enough to connect a handful of devices. For the camera to run 24/7, it needs to stay charged and have a steady Wi-Fi signal.</p>
<p>When looking at a power source, consider what works better for you: A battery-powered camera that can easily be removed and charged, or a plug-in system to set and forget? Is it easy to find a plug where you want to install the camera? What would happen to the camera if you should ever lose power or a Wi-Fi signal?</p>
<p><b>Cloud or app storage</b><strong>:</strong> Cloud storage will keep all of your data online and let you safely access it a few different ways. App storage will keep data directly on your phone. Storage options will vary depending on the camera and app you choose. The preferred method is cloud storage so you can store as much as necessary.</p>
<p><b>Monthly fee</b><strong>:</strong> Most cameras come with limited storage for free, ranging from a few hours to a few days. Some self-monitoring systems allow you to upgrade your storage or monitoring plan for an additional cost.</p>
<h2 id="how-secure">How secure are outdoor cameras?</h2>
<p>In today’s world, cybersecurity is a hot topic. Most home Wi-Fi networks are password protected with additional firewalls for safety. For most homeowners, maintaining a secure Wi-Fi password that is not kid/petname123 is the best way to keep your cameras secured. It is always good to remember to use <a href="https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/home-wireless-network-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best practices</a> for Wi-Fi; it will ensure your self-monitored systems are safe and secure.</p>
<p>Security concerns don’t stop with your Wi-Fi, though. Internet-connected cameras are always on and always transmitting, so in the past, they’ve been prime targets for botnet attacks that hijack common devices and use them to overload web servers. Even Wi-Fi itself was shaken to the core last year when security researchers demonstrated the <a href="https://www.krackattacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“KRACK” vulnerability</a> that gave access to encrypted data sent over Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>We don’t want our cameras to fall into the wrong hands, but there’s really nothing we can do ourselves to check for vulnerabilities in the camera, website or app programming. Buying a web-connected device, we have to trust that the engineers at the manufacturer or service provider are doing what they can to track down and fix vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Each camera we tested came with additional paperwork informing us of safety and security features that the camera, app or software provided. Software updates were sent out at least once for each camera that we tested. It was important to see that security was one of the top things on each companies lists, as it was for us when testing.</p>
<p>Beyond the security of the website and camera, you also need to think about the security of devices you allow to access your footage and notifications.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075P84FH2/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Arlo &#8211; Pro 2</b></a> allows for only one user to be on the app at once, and further protects it by requiring a fingerprint authentication before continuing. This means that users must have the latest version of smartphones. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I01QLTE/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Amcrest &#8211; ProHD</b></a> only allowed for one device to have access to the live feed at a time, and the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077FXPJJG/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vimtag &#8211; B3-S Outdoor Camera</a></strong> stores all footage on an included SD card, not on your phone or in the cloud, so you must have access to the camera to view previous footage.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Camera location</h3>
<p>First, we scoped out the best location for our outdoor cameras. Where was all the action happening, what do we want to monitor, where could we get the best view, and where is the best location aesthetically?</p>
<p>For the front of the house, we picked the corner of the porch to be able to see the front door, the driveway, the sidewalk and street in front of the house. We chose this area because it was the best position to see the direction someone was able to enter and exit the property.</p>
<p>For the backyard, we picked both central and corner areas over the patio/balcony that would best see where and how people would enter the property. It was also set with the intention to monitor our kids and pets activities as well as any potential wildlife that cruised through the backyard. The easiest setup spot was for the garage, set to view who came in and out.</p>

<h3>Software setup</h3>
<p>It is important to note that you <strong>must</strong> set up the phone app before installing<b>.</b> Another pro-tip: have your smartphone already connected to your home Wi-Fi router. We discovered that this small task will make your life a lot easier during the install phase.</p>
<p>All smartphone applications were the same name brand as the camera itself. We headed over to the Google Play store and iTunes to download the apps. Once fully installed, the app will walk you through the remaining setup steps.</p>

Standard Blink batteries boast a two-year battery life, making this the best option for a wire- and worry-free system.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XZWHBJ4/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>All cameras had a printed QR code and serial number on the device. Using your smartphone camera, you slowly roll over the code to pick up the device’s unique signal. This was the longest step in the setup process; it took us two or three attempts for most cameras to successfully connect to the app and start syncing. Once connected, our live feed began. Our top performing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3I9L8M/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nest &#8211; Cam Outdoor</a>, Ring &#8211; Spotlight Cam and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XZWHBJ4/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blink &#8211; XT Home Security Camera</a> all connected in under 20 seconds once scanned, unlike the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077FXPJJG/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vimtag &#8211; B3-S Outdoor Camera</a> (we actually tested the BS-1 model, per note in &#8220;Other finalists&#8221; section below) which sent out a signal and took nearly five minutes before we could move onto the next step.</p>
<p>Now that our self-monitored camera system has started running, it is time to install the cameras. We finished the software setup after the physical cameras are installed, which includes the customization of the feed and best picture angle.</p>

<p>Every camera came with all essential supplies: wall mounts, screws and drywall screws to make installation easy. The only at home supplies used to install the cameras were a power drill, ladder and extension cord. While some bases such as the Vimtag and Amcrest needed more than two hands to help hold the base in place so the camera doesn’t hang and bang around during install, we loved the Nest and the Arlo’s magnetic base that made it easy to install prior to camera setup and then adjust with only one person.</p>
<p>It is important to note the length of the power cord for plug-in cameras for your self-monitoring system, if any, when considering a location. Knowing the distance helped us find the best place to plug the cameras in and then buy any additional supplies needed to hide the cords of the camera. We used a plastic wire hider or command hooks. If you don’t like the idea or look of camera or extension cords we recommend going with the wireless Arlo or Blink cameras.</p>
<h3>Motion activity and sensitivity</h3>
<p>Once the camera and notifications were set, it was time to set off the alarms. We walked, skipped and ran past each camera, timing with a stopwatch how long it took notifications to be sent to our phones. Most notifications were sent within seconds with the Nest, Arlo, Ring and Blink coming nearly instantaneously.</p>
<p>The true test was when the cameras sensed motion at a point when we were not ready and waiting for them. Whether it was a postal delivery, a neighbor walking by or an animal wandering through, we jumped on the live feed once a notification was received to see what it was for and how delayed it was in sending. The best night view came from the Ring; as soon as motion was detected, two powerful lights came on to enhance the video and scare off any unwanted guest.</p>
<p>Each camera performed well, but some a bit too well. We had to adjust our notifications so we didn’t see every bird fly by or leaf fall from the tree. One of our favorite features was the “Anti-Dither” featured on the Amcrest; this allows you to specify how long you want something to move before sending out alerts.</p>
<p>Most apps had these custom settings to allow us to do so. Another benefit of some self-monitored systems is that they allow for the user to set “motion zones,” or specific areas in the field of view for which to receive notifications. We set these for the top of a door or sidewalk to avoid smaller movement.</p>
<h3>Wi-Fi and self-monitored systems</h3>
<p>A live feed and notification is only as good as how accurately and quickly they are received. All cameras we tested had a live feed delay of 5 seconds or less and notifications came within 10 seconds, but there are a few factors that could delay or change the delay time.</p>

<p>If you have a large home or are running cameras far away from your Wi-Fi router, that creates a laggy feed, so a simple addition to your home may be installing a plugin Wi-Fi extender. This will boost the signal another few hundred to thousand feet depending on the brand and device you choose. A good rule of thumb is that if your phone can pick up Wi-Fi, so can your camera. Both the Blink and Arlo came with their own base extender to allow you to install your cameras in even the outermost reaches of your home.</p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>We had two vastly different personalities testing the self-monitored camera systems, one who was very tech savvy and another who “just needs it to work the first time.” Our results showed that if you can follow the instructions provided, and have a little patience, a self-monitoring system can easily be set up in your home by any level of a tech expert.</p>
<p>Just in case, we went to each company’s FAQ page to see how accessible help would be if needed. These camera companies have plenty of resources on their websites and help pages so you can become your own home security expert without having to pay a professional. We used the “tips and tricks” to help us further customize our feed and app, and we found it especially helpful for setting motion zones.</p>
<p>If it’s just not working out for you, you can pay a professional installer. Nest has a <a href="https://nest.com/nest-pro-installation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">professional installer locator</a>, and there’s a service on Amazon you can order for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N6ZOREJ/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ring-specific installation</a>. If a brand you go with doesn’t have a resource for a pro install, you may be able to get by with <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/geek-squad/pcmcat138100050018.c?id=pcmcat138100050018" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Geek Squad</a> or an equivalent since these installs require relatively basic handyman skills for hardware install and basic networking and app setup.</p>

<p>The Nest system is probably the most recognized name in both indoor and outdoor home security cameras, and in our testing of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3I9L8M/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nest &#8211; Cam Outdoor</a> we found out why they are such a powerhouse. Continuous 24/7 recording with a great app interface that highlights “footage activity points” proved its worth. Instant motion alerts via phone or email put our minds at ease too.</p>
<p>The Nest walks you through each step from unboxing to install. The camera comes with a powerful magnetic base that secures with concealed screws. Once set, the camera snaps into the base. We loved that it can be moved with a 360-degree swivel and no hindrance on angles of view. Its cord is 25-feet-long, the longest of all we tested, allowing more flexibility in reaching the furthest corners of your home..</p>
<p>The Nest app offers the most options for notifications, whereas other systems tended to be push notification only<strong>.</strong> Alerts for the push notification were instant, with the text and email following up shortly. A family-friendly feature of the Nest is that access can be shared so more than one person is notified.</p>

Nest lives up to its reputation as the best option for easy-to-use outdoor security cameras with simple setup, 24/7 live feed and an intuitive phone application.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3I9L8M/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our favorite option that set the Nest self-monitoring system above the others was the free live-feed scroll feature. The Nest was the only camera that provided this along with 24/7 recording. With just the touch of your finger, you are able to scroll through recordings to create time-lapse videos of your day, extract clips, and grab screenshot images. Segments with activity are highlighted using dots to help you find the action.</p>
<p>At first, having the 24-hour feed to scroll through seemed like overkill. Other apps organize “areas of motion” better by simply filing those videos in order of timestamps. But the Nest is the only camera that lets you easily scroll through a full day’s worth of video. We found that ability frequently comes in handy.</p>
<p>When viewing the feed, the Nest had the clearest picture of any camera during both day and night. The app’s 8x zoom lets you inspect detail the Nest already captures that you don’t see on your phone at the standard image size. The image enhancement feature helps with otherwise grainy images. As shown in the image below, the cat is a zoomed-in detail from the original feed in the upper right corner.</p>

<p>The Nest camera is fully customizable on the phone app. You are able to set times to record or pair it with your smartphone GPS. You can set it to not record or notify when you are at home, a feature that might be more useful for an indoor camera. When creating motion zones, you can set more than one zone per camera.</p>
<p>A great safety feature of most self-monitored systems is the ability to talk back through the cameras. The Nest two-way talk was the loudest of any camera we tested.</p>
<p>If the power goes out at your house, your Wi-Fi disconnects or the cord is cut, you will immediately get a push notification on your phone. It will let you know the camera has lost connection and attach the “last image recorded”. This is a great built-in security feature that no other self-monitoring system offered.</p>

<p>The Nest system has the most diverse product lineup if you’re looking to set up a connected smart home. They also make video doorbells, keyless entryways, thermostats, security alarm system, smoke and carbon monoxide sensors and temperature sensors.</p>
<p>Overall, we found that the Nest &#8211; Cam Outdoor is an industry leader for a reason This user-friendly system records 24/7, alerts you when and how you want it to and records extra detail so you can zoom in when reviewing. The Nest has basically perfected the self-monitoring setup to ensure that you see the moments you need to see at the right moment.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>24/7 recording and the ability to easily scroll through footage set the Nest &#8211; Cam Outdoor apart from the competitors.</li>
<li>You can share notifications with others makes this a family friendly security option.</li>

<p>Coming in a very close second to the Nest camera, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075P84FH2/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arlo &#8211; Pro 2</a> is a great choice for your self-monitored security system. This battery-powered self-monitored camera definitely packs a punch with its fully customizable setup. With options for motion zones, picture quality, times to record and alerts, you can set up the Arlo to best fit your needs.</p>
<p>To start the setup, we connected the hub to our home router via an ethernet cable. You then need to sync the cameras with the hub by pushing a sync button on both units. Setup was the easiest out of any cameras tested and did not require any scanning.</p>
<p>Like the Nest cams, the Arlo has a magnetic base so the cameras can be easily removed and repositioned. While repositioning was easy, the design of the base limits the range of positioning angles compared to the Nest, but it was not a dealbreaker. Both cameras allow the feed to be flipped if it is a better placement for the cameras to sit upside down.</p>

<p><strong>One unique feature that the Arlo &#8211; Pro 2 has is complete wireless freedom.</strong> The camera batteries come fully charged from the factory, and last up to three months at the lowest picture quality. Batteries on best video quality ran down much quicker, only lasting a few weeks, but fully charged back up within an hour. To charge the batteries simply remove the camera and open the back, no screwdrivers or tools needed.</p>
<p>To save storage space, the Arlo does not constantly record unless you have an upgraded CVR (continuous video recording) plan. The camera only records when it senses movement and puts the video into files on the phone app organized by day. CVR prices start at $99 per year for CVR of 14 days, or $199 per year for 30 days of saved feed. Since CVR is an additional cost to the 30-60 days of storage for the standard plan, we qualified it as a “hidden fee.”</p>
<p>If you’re not inclined to pay extra for the CVR upgrade, there is a free plan that records only motion, then stores it on the cloud for seven days. For most people, this free plan is more than sufficient and makes the Arlo a more attractive choice if you just download any motion you want to save within a few days.</p>

The Arlo was no different from other cameras we tested when it came to motion alerts as push notifications came within seconds of testing. The Arlo can be fully customized to fit your needs, though the options were overwhelming at times. With the factory settings, this can be a set-up-and-go system but plan to spend some time getting used to all the settings.</p>
<p>Like other cameras, you can set up motion zones and times to record. From the home screen, you can see the battery life, adjust the picture and view recent videos. But again, Arlo’s interface felt a bit too busy to quickly find the desired setting.</p>
<p>The 100-decibel siren, which broadcasts from the base hub, is a nice perk to the Arlo. It’s loud enough to draw attention from neighbors and was sharp enough to make our testers jump — even when they knew it was coming.</p>

The Arlo's 100-decibel siren is a convenient way to scare off intruders.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075P84FH2/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The siren can be set off a few different ways. You can manually trigger it from the app after receiving a motion notification. Or you can program an alarm to be triggered by certain levels of motion, based on rules that you set in the app. There are also different options for the siren duration and noise levels.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, if the siren isn’t for your household it can easily be switched off with the touch of a button or disabled completely. Since the siren broadcasts from the hub, you will want to ensure the hub is near a window to draw attention from neighbors.</p>
<p>You can easily customize your home-security setup by connecting other Arlo products to your hub, such as extra security cameras, baby monitors and even camera-controlled security lights.</p>
<p>Overall, the Arlo &#8211; Pro 2 is a respectable camera and nice addition to your self-monitored security system. It may come down to personal preference, but the free 24/7 recording and simple set up and scroll feature on the Nest just barely edged the Arlo out of the top spot.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Arlo &#8211; Pro 2 cameras are battery operated and provide a cleaner install for those who don’t want to manage wires.</li>
<li>Only recording when motion is detected, this model helps save storage space.</li>
<li>The 100-decibel siren offers another way to scare off potential intruders when motion is detected in your preset zones.</li>
<li>As a wireless system, battery life is our only concern, and for the best battery life, you will sacrifice some image quality.</li>

<p>This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I01QLTE/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amcrest &#8211; ProHD IP3M-943</a> plug-in-and-go camera won major points for its customization and night vision capabilities. Due to its ability to adjust every detail, we found this to be the best camera for commercial use and those familiar with sophisticated camera setups.</p>
<p>The feed starts by connecting through your phone’s Wi-Fi, then it sends an audio tone to the camera that tells it how to connect securely to the network. This tone is like receiving a text message “ping.”</p>
<p>Once the live feed started, we were instructed to set up alerts and notifications. The system is set up to record and alert when motion is detected, and notifications were instant when we tested it. Like the Arlo, the Amcrest ProHD only records when it senses motion in the field of view.</p>
<p>The Amcrest has a feature that no other camera had: the “Anti-Dither” option, which adjusts the amount of time an object has to move before the video starts recording. This is a major feature that scored big points for us and that we hope other cameras will adopt.</p>
<p>The Anti-Dither helps save storage space (and your patience) by avoiding a lot of pictures of birds flying by your cameras. It can be set to allow anywhere from 5-60 seconds of movement before the recording starts. Like most other self-monitoring systems, you have the ability to set zones on the camera to alert you and start recording.</p>
<p>The Amcrest provided the best night vision of any camera tested. It was detailed and clear. A word of caution: this camera can be easily spotted at night with its red infrared lights that stay on to provide clarity on the night image.</p>
<p>Both day and night zoom features work well. The Amcrest adjusts its picture quality based on the device you’re viewing it on; this helps keep the image in proper aspect ratio. Overall, looking on a smartphone, tablet or computer, this camera provided one of the clearest pictures of any camera tested.<b></b></p>

<p>Another unique feature is adjustable brightness and contrast. This can be useful if there are major obstacles within the camera’s view that you can’t avoid, but you want to avoid it being the main points of camera exposure.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to capture activity in your backyard, but the placement of the camera means it will record the inside of your house too. At night, the camera will expose an average of the scene, meaning the inside of your house will look right, but the scene of your backyard (where you care about watching for activity) will be much too dark. Being able to manually adjust exposure will make the inside of your house be too bright, but the outdoor scene exposed for properly at night.</p>
<p>The long list of customizations options might overwhelm some users. You have to be a little tech savvy to understand everything that can be done, but for our testing, we found the factory settings worked well.</p>
<p>Another downfall is that it does not record 24/7 without installing a micro SD card (not included). The Amcrest comes with free viewing on both your app and your computer and four hours of free storage on their website.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a self-monitored system that can be set to very specific specifications, the Amcrest &#8211; ProHD is worth checking out. We loved the clarity and customization that the software provides and it&#8217;s clear that this is designed for commercial installations.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Amcrest &#8211; ProHD IP3M-943 was the most customizable of any system we tested, which might overwhelm some users.</li>
<li>An “Anti-Dither” feature allows the Amcrest to ignore insignificant motion that would otherwise fill up your recording space.</li>
<li>Amcrest provided the clearest night time picture but had an easily spotted red light when recording.</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XZWHBJ4/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blink &#8211; XT Home Security Camera</a> camera is a simple, no fuss, user-friendly outdoor camera that has no subscription or data storage fees. With two-year battery life, this is a great option for someone who wants to set it and forget it, and quickly became one of the favorites of our testers.</p>
<p>The setup was easy: Video how-tos automatically appeared on the bottom of the phone screen showing us how to open and install from start to finish. Like the other cameras, you can scan in a QR code to pair the hardware with the app, but if you are having trouble you can also enter in the nine-digit serial code. The only setup needed outside of downloading the app is installing the two AA batteries included in the box.</p>
<p>The hardware to set up the camera on the wall is best placed with a straight on shot of what you need to see. Unlike other cameras, the mount is a flat base and only allows you to slightly move the camera up and down. But once up, it stays up — no messing with wires or recharging batteries. The batteries included boasted a two-year life. We didn’t test for two years, but there was no change in the battery indicator during our month-long test.</p>

<p>On the Blink app home screen, you do not have a live feed but rather a picture of the last known motion. There are two buttons on the picture: a video and a camera icon. Click on the video and you go to a live feed; click on the camera and it takes a snapshot of what it sees. There is also a switch to “Arm” the camera. If you are recording in the backyard, and know the kids are playing, you can easily shut off notifications to save time and space on the app. (Just don&#8217;t forget to re-arm the camera!)</p>
<p>Alerts came via push notifications on our device and popped up in under 20 seconds. You can see the video right from the notification, and don’t need to open the app. Videos are stored directly on the app in order of recording. There are no folders for days or months; simply scroll down to see all saved videos.</p>
<p>A favorite feature with the Blink app is that it auto-deletes videos that you do not deem important. If there is a clip that you wish to save, you share it or download it from the app directly. The user can have it set to auto-delete videos after 3, 7, 14 or 30 days, or even after one year. We loved this feature, as we found it cumbersome to delete old videos and images after testing.</p>
<p>Customization on the Blink app was fairly straightforward. Factory settings did not need to be adjusted on our test. The Blink also has a health meter built into its customization tab. You can view the battery life, temperature, Wi-Fi strength and whether any updates are available.</p>
<p>The Blink &#8211; XT Home Security Camera camera might be the most basic of outdoor cameras we tested, but it shouldn’t be underestimated to get the job done. We loved the straightforward, easy-to-use app that was designed with the busy person in mind. Setup was a breeze, alerts are quick, there is nothing to overly customize, and batteries don’t need to be recharged. The Blink camera is a smart choice for those who need to monitor any given area without all the fuss of a fancy system.</p>

<p>Relatively new to the industry, and famous for their video doorbells, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758L64L9/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ring &#8211; Spotlight Cameras</a> focus on providing more than just motion alerts and peace of mind. We loved that this camera has built-in lights, a replacement for the motion-detector floodlights that have been popular for decades: The option to trigger both a siren and flashing lights when motion is detected definitely adds functionality over camera-only options.</p>
<p>Setting up the Ring was a breeze. The phone application was user-friendly and walked you through all steps. If you got stuck or spent more than 60 seconds on a page, a pop-up appeared that linked to their YouTube page for additional instructions. We did not need to click the YouTube links, but we were grateful they were there.</p>
<p>Once up and running, the box includes all the hardware you need, including a drill bit and screwdriver. The camera hangs down from the mount and you can rotate 360 degrees and tilt 45 degrees. The Ring camera has two slots open for battery packs; only one battery is included.</p>

We loved the “neighbors” features that offers a feed where you can post and see suspicious activity around your home.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758L64L9/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Ring has our favorite feature of any camera app that we tested: The Community Page. This allows everyone within a few miles of you to post their videos of suspicious activities. Like a Facebook feed, you can post, like, comment and share videos. While testing, our community page had videos of package thieves, solicitors and concerned neighbors talking about loiterers.</p>
<p>The Ring differs from other cameras we tested with its two high-powered lights attached to the unit. These lights come on after dark when it senses motion adding another level of protection.</p>
<p>A major setback for the Ring was the battery life. We set up the camera with one fully charged battery and selected the option to have the live feed available when we wanted to see it. A pop-up appeared warning us that the live feed and &#8220;best picture&#8221; settings would drain the battery quicker.</p>
<p>We found the battery needed to be recharged twice per month to use the best picture quality. Even with a low battery, alerts were sent and the motion was recorded with no noticeable loss of quality. For an additional cost, you can buy a Ring Solar Panel that connects to the Ring; we think this might be necessary for most users.</p>
<p>The Ring offers an optional siren that is easily turned on or off from your phone. The siren also pairs with a set of lights on the bottom of the device that flash blue and red. Unlike the Arlo, the 110-decibel siren plays directly from the device and echoes from the surrounding walls, really making the testers and neighbors jump. The way that the device clicks into the wall mount makes it hard to pull down or steal; if you have the siren on, no one is going to stick around and try to turn it off.</p>
<p>The Ring provides the ability to easily switch on and off alerts, or snooze for a certain amount of time. When we were working in the backyard, we were able to snooze for 15, 30, 60 or 120 minutes; this silenced our phone notifications, but the camera still recorded the motion. As soon as the snooze time ran out, alerts resumed as normal.</p>
<p>Designed with the user in mind, you have the ability to customize the Ring settings, but they are not overwhelming as other cameras tested. Smart alerts can be set to light, standard or frequent; each adjusts to the motion sensitivity.</p>
<p>Overall, the Ring &#8211; Spotlight Cam rivals the Nest for its simplicity but falls behind the Arlo with its features. The app and features stood out from other cameras that we tested, and it was obvious that this was designed by real people for real scenarios. The community page is something we hope that other camera manufacturers will adopt. No buyer’s remorse with the Ring — we think this is a great addition to your home security system if its simplicity fits your needs.</p>

<p>Note: We initially tested and reviewed the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0198PPD5Y/?tag=ybdoutcam-20&amp;th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vimtag &#8211; B-1 Outdoor Camera</a>. Prior to publication, we learned from the manufacturer that the B-1 model is being phased out and replaced with the newer <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077FXPJJG/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vimtag &#8211; B3-S Outdoor Camera</a>. Therefore, we have replaced all references to the B-1 with the B3-S throughout this article. The main difference appears to be a more streamlined look and slightly smaller size, plus it has better zoom and the image resolution increased from 720p HD to 1080p HD.</p>
<p>The Vimtag &#8211; B3-S Outdoor Camera is a heavy-duty camera that reminds us of a TV prop from the 90s. The camera came ready to use out of the box, with subscriptions that can either be set up from an app or directly from their website. The Vimtag rivaled the Amcrest for functionality, but this system was designed for an IT superstar rather than the average homeowner.</p>
<p>Setup for the Vimtag was not difficult, but it took some patience. The unit does need to be plugged in and only came with a 6.5-foot cord. We were able to install it using an open window and an extension cord. In addition to the power cord, there are two other wires that hang from the camera. One is for an optional Ethernet connection, and another provides a wired video feed. If not properly hidden, they would be a major eyesore. The Vimtag does not detach from the base, which made the install a little harder.</p>
<p>Like most other outdoor cameras, we gave the Vimtag app to our camera&#8217;s unique serial number using a QR code. Rather than using a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection from the phone to tell the camera how to log into a secure network, the app sends a high-pitched audio tone for the camera to listen to. This unpleasant process takes nearly two minutes.</p>
<p>While this method of connecting your camera to Wi-Fi is not susceptible to Bluetooth or Wi-Fi hacking, we debated its benefits after we found out that you have to repeat this setup <i>every time</i> the camera loses power or a Wi-Fi signal.</p>
<p>A favorite feature was that you are able to set your preferences to record based on the size of movement (think people, not animals). The app also features the ability to customize your feed or pictures. You can set the area you want to record, but overall no specific motion zones to be alerted too. You can set the quality based on lighting, and easily turn on and off the camera from your phone.</p>
<p>With the Vimtag app, you are able to access the live feed at any time. Like the Nest, the Vimtag records 24/7 but does not store in one continuous file: It keeps all videos in 30-minute increments. Unfortunately, this quickly ate up storage on our phone; and if we needed to go back to find a specific point in the day, it meant sifting through nearly 50 videos per day.</p>
<p>Since the feed and recordings were not triggered by motion, we were not able to quickly find an image or footage of an event. We either had to go through all previous videos, or we had to take down the camera and pull out the SD card in the camera.</p>

<p>A major design flaw with the Vimtag is the storage system. If the power goes out or the Wi-Fi is disconnected, you will need to set up the camera from step one. In the unfortunate event of the cord being cut or unplugged, the camera instantly loses connection to the app and you lose any previously recorded footage that is not downloaded. If you are able to recover the camera, all the footage is stored in the 32GB SD card located in the back of the unit. For this reason, we recommend installing the camera in a very high place, making it hard for any unauthorized folks to take it.</p>
<p>Overall this was our least-favorite outdoor security camera. We did not find it to be user-friendly, and it&#8217;s not something the average person would use in their house. More suited for a commercial setting where it could be managed by an IT person, we concluded that there are better outdoor security cameras to choose from.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>With a quick, clear feed and instantaneous alerts the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I3I9L8M/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nest &#8211; Cam Outdoor</a> is a great option to add a level of self-monitored security to your house. One of our favorite features was the easy-to-use app and its ability to scroll through days of footage with a simple scroll through the app.</p>
<p>If a wireless camera is more up your alley, we commend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075P84FH2/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arlo &#8211; Pro 2</a>. With features similar to the Nest Cam, The Arlo allows the user a bit more customization to the picture quality, includes an additional siren, and saves space by not continuously recording. An honorable mention for a commercial, tech-savvy product, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I01QLTE/?tag=ybdoutcam-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amcrest &#8211; ProHD IP3M-943</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking to connect multiple devices, or to create a smart house, the Nest brand offers many other self-monitoring devices that tailor to your specific self-monitored security-system needs. You can easily link thermostats, locks and cameras to a single app on your phone. Additionally, Nest offers one of the most inexpensive upgraded plans: for only $5 per month, you can store up to seven days’ worth of footage in the cloud.</p>
<p>Overall the Nest outdoor security camera is a great option for both renters and homeowners, as it can be installed easily and adjusted quickly. The app is user-friendly and can be accessed from either a computer or smartphone and access can be shared with multiple people. The quality of the picture during both day and night, along with its zoom feature, made this the best option to clearly capture all activity. Recording 24/7, this is a great device to add peace of mind and home protection while capturing all of life’s precious moments.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter 10 weeks of research and extensive in-home testing with our top five products, we found the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MA2T9BC/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Pet Zone &#8211; Smart Scoop</a> to be the best automatic litter box. In addition to being automatic, it’s brilliant at the basics: you can use regular litter, it has a familiar open litter box shape and is not disruptive with its quiet cleaning. Our test cats, Kit Kat and Jelly Bean, preferred its familiar, open design and we appreciated its low maintenance and efficient cleaning. Coming in as our runner-up, the highly regarded<a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Litter-Robot III &#8211; Open Air</a> litter box offers impressive design, but at a higher cost.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>The promise of having to scoop even one less clump of litter is enticing to any cat owner. However, these products can feel like an expensive gamble as they can be ten times more expensive than a manual litter box and have less-than-stellar reviews.</p>
<p>Our research brought us to many articles that only ranked the automatic litter boxes by their advertised features and consumer reviews. Unfortunately, we didn’t come across articles with any real in-home testing, so we took this opportunity to do our own discovery.</p>
<p>We also combed through the /r/Pets subreddit, where it seemed like many cat owners resorted to their own hacks for manual litter box clean-up since automatic litter boxes can be tricky. Finally, we read through hundreds of Amazon reviews on various automatic litter boxes to help us identify what users look for in the perfect automatic litter box.</p>
<p>With our hours of research and personal experience in caring for two cats, we honed in on the most important features for a good automatic litter box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Effectiveness in cleaning</li>
<li>Impact on cat’s usage</li>
<li>Setup and programmable features</li>
<li>Environmental presence</li>
<li>Odor control</li>
<li>Frequency of maintenance</li>
</ul>

<p>With over three million Google search results for “how often do I have to clean my cat’s litter?” you can easily surmise it’s an unpleasant chore that is often delayed. While it may stink that you need to clean it, it’s never good for your cat to have a filthy, full litter box. This could lead to a number of issues, ranging from negative association with the litter box (causing accidents around the house) to more serious health issues like urinary tract diseases. An automatic litter box can easily aid in maintaining a clean and approachable bathroom area for your cat by taking care of the cleaning process and removing waste from the litter for you.</p>
<p>The health benefits for your cat mostly depend on a litter box that’s clean, so let’s face it, this is just as much about what <b><i>you</i></b> need. A self-cleaning litter box is valuable to any cat owner wanting to add convenience to their daily routine unless you have one of those magical felines who will participate in toilet-training. The automatic box can make an even bigger difference if you have multiple cats. If you’re tired of scooping out your cat’s litter box daily, then an automatic litter box is probably something you’ve considered more than once already.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Cost:</b> The price tag for an automatic litter box can range from a minimum of $100 to $450. This doesn’t include the cost of litter and the accessories the box may require. Also, a good rule of thumb for the number of litter boxes in your house is one per cat, plus an additional one.</p>
<p><b>Effectiveness in cleaning:</b> The whole purpose of buying a self-cleaning/automatic litter box is in its name. You want a product that fulfills its claims. It’s important to consider what type of mechanism the litter box uses to clean the waste. Does it rake? Does it scoop? Does it sift? We found that sifting did much better than raking, with scoops performing somewhere in between.</p>
<p><b>Impact on cat’s usage:</b> Transitioning any cat to change can be a difficult undertaking. You have to be careful in not disrupting your cat’s habitat too much, regardless of how convenient it is to your lifestyle. If the design is very different than what your cat is used to, consider keeping their regular litter box around to ease the transition (and your ability to return the new box to the manufacturer if the cat won’t touch it.)</p>
<p><b>Setup and programmable features:</b> Nobody likes reading through long pages of manuals to set up a new product. It’s also important to note what features are available with your litter box. Can it be programmed to clean at certain times? Is there an indicator for how many times your cat has used it?</p>
<p><b>Environmental presence:</b> Your cat’s bathroom area shouldn’t be a statement piece in your home. It should be able to coexist with your living space and not be so loud that it frequently annoys you.</p>
<p><strong>Frequency of maintenance and odor control:</strong> Again, automatic litter boxes should turn the litter box maintenance from a daily process to a weekly one, keeping your cat’s litter area tidy enough between maintenance sessions and controlling the smell that comes from a filthy litter box.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>When you’re trying to choose the right product, online searches can lead you down a rabbit hole of reviews and lead to reservations about spending so much on a design you’re not confident in. While the existing reviews we found only rank litter boxes by comparing features, we did the real dirty work for you.</p>
<h3>Comfort for your cats and for you</h3>

<p>If you’ve ever turned a printer on around a cat, you know firsthand how intrigued and surprised a cat can be about an inanimate object moving. <strong>Now imagine how they feel when their litter box comes to life.</strong></p>
<p>It was a careful and calculated process transitioning Kit Kat and Jelly Bean to test out the efficacy of these litter boxes. As cats are creatures of habits, it is recommended that you keep their existing litter boxes next to or near their new ones to help ease the transition. This is a bit of an issue for the CatGenie, which had to be placed next to a toilet. Then, slowly phase their old litter boxes out once they get adjusted to the new one.</p>
<p>With this in mind, and our five self-cleaning litter boxes ready, we set up their new automatic litter boxes in their existing bathroom area. We kept their old litter box nearby, too. With the litter boxes that used regular litter, we stuck with our tried and true, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LPSIO6/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fresh Step &#8211; Ultra Unscented.</a> With the litter boxes that required specialized litter, we used their respective branded products.</p>
<p>We observed how they reacted to the cleaning mechanisms in action and whether that scared them away from using some boxes. We also noted how easy (or difficult) it was for the cats to get in and out of the boxes.</p>
<p>Of course, despite our planning and adhering to litter box transition guidelines, cats aren’t robots: we had two accidents. We know that this was not an easy adjustment for them, either, so we added an <i>additional </i>manual litter box nearby to help them transition. Overall, it’s important when changing anything with your pet’s surroundings to be attentive, and react when you see that they need help.</p>
<p>The litter box room-presence was another important aspect of <i>human</i> comfort we considered. Our cats use the litter box quite often, so it was imperative that the automatic litter box wasn’t loud, as it would be running often. We also noted how each litter box looked in our living space.</p>
<h3>Automatic cleaning mechanism</h3>
<p>We never knew there was so much to learn about litter boxes. However, after testing out five litter boxes with particular cleaning mechanisms, we discovered the pros and cons of each method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scoops did a good job cleaning waste but sometimes left crumbs around the litter box.</li>
<li>Rakes did not leave a mess but were sometimes loud and would often get waste stuck on the teeth, requiring additional maintenance.</li>
<li>The toilet system cleaned very thoroughly but was hot and loud</li>
<li>The sifting system also cleaned well but the turning dome could be intimidating to cats.</li>
</ul>
<p>We rated the effectiveness of each cleaning mechanism by comparing to our usual method of manually cleaning with a scooper by hand.</p>
<p>It was important that the automatic litter boxes sifted through the litter, removed the waste completely and reset the litter so it was smoothed out. We also observed how each mechanism disposed of the waste and whether it controlled the odor. Odor control really depended on how well the litter type covered the smell and how each receptacle kept smells in.</p>
<h3>Setup and additional features</h3>
<p>We determined if the setup was easy or difficult by timing how long each litter box took to set up, whether it required additional tools, and if it required a specific location. Manuals that were simple and easy to follow also made a difference in setup time.</p>
<p>The setup also revealed whether there were additional things to program and what the buttons on the litter box did. It was significant for us that the litter box could sense the cat’s presence, which they all were able to do. All of the litter boxes included a safeguard to stop the litter box from running if a cat is detected in the box. Additional features were a bonus and not necessary in the effectiveness of cleaning and convenience of use.</p>

<h3>Maintenance and cost of ownership</h3>
<p>We noted how frequently we had to monitor the litter box for any clogs or clumps that were stuck. It was imperative the cleaning mechanism worked effectively as this influenced the maintenance of the litter box. We also observed the size of the waste receptacle and how often we had to replace or clean it out.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the litter boxes required additional accessories or specialized brand litter, adding extra costs for the usage of the litter box.</strong> It also was relevant how much the litter box itself costs, as they vary greatly in price. So when you take into consideration wanting multiple automatic litter boxes, it can add up even more quickly.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">The best automatic litter box: SmartScoop</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10370" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop.jpg" alt="the Pet Zone Smartscoop box" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-768x512@2x.jpg 1536w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pet-zone-smartscoop-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>This was a clear win. Even though the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MA2T9BC/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Pet Zone &#8211; SmartScoop</b></a> did not have the flashy features of other models, it simply worked well. It can be difficult to determine what the best automatic litter box is when they all tout special features like the best cleaning mechanism or appealing design. However, the most important aspects were not whether you could flush your cat’s waste through a toilet or a counter that tracks the frequency of your cat’s litter box usage to help monitor their health: the simple and thorough cleaning mechanism wins.</p>

Our cats preferred its open, familiar design and we appreciated its low maintenance.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MA2T9BC/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Pet Zone provided convenience with its ease of handling and simple, functional features. It can sense when a cat enters the litter box and stays for a period of time. It cleans up after the cat leaves, preventing any odor from lingering too long.</p>
<p>There’s enough room for even the twenty-pound Kit Kat, with a considerable litter area and without the closed space that might cause problems for bigger cats. It was not obtrusive in our room; it looks like a regular litter box and is low to the ground. The noise level is minimal, with a low whirring sound as it runs through its cleaning cycle.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is designed to be simple and easy for both cats and humans to use. It is a straightforward, open top litter box. Unlike some competitors, it provides a recognizable rectangular shape and allows for the regular litter your cats are accustomed to using.</p>
<p>The uncovered design allows for an easy entrance for any sized cat. All together, Pet Zone provided a familiar bathroom environment, so both our cats adjusted to using it quickly. It raked and scooped fairly quickly, so the noise didn’t last too long either. This was important since it never bothered or intimidated the cats from using it.</p>

<p>Pet Zone’s raking and scooping deflector has a pretty thorough method of cleaning. The dual system uses regular litter and ensures the clumps of litter gets raked clean to one side, which then gathers it all so it can be swept up in a scooping motion and deposited into the waste drawer. Although some clumps got stuck, it didn’t happen frequently, and only with larger blocks of waste. It came with a tool designed for the very purpose of removing clumps, so it was a painless task to just tap the scooper to unblock it.</p>
<p>There are no bells and whistles with the Pet Zone. It has a simple AC adaptor that you plug into an outlet, and an on/off switch. It doesn’t need to programmed since the cleaning timer was already excellent. We never had issues with either cat being in contact with the rake. The Pet Zone only needs to be plugged in, no extra setup requirements. It did its job well and thoroughly and cut back on a lot of manual cleaning.</p>

<p>High-end and high-tech aren’t words we would use to describe the typical litter box. However, those two qualities are found in our runner up, the <a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Litter-Robot III</a>. From the smooth round design and sturdy build to the impressive rotating dome sifter, this is a remarkable litter box. It even lights up inside and emits a blue glow when it’s dark.</p>
<p>Litter-Robot’s patented rotating and sifting system was one of the most thorough cleaning mechanisms we observed. <strong>It uses regular litter and does the most effective job in completely cleaning clumps of waste, as this method leaves no litter unturned (litter-ally).</strong> The detached globe slowly rotates to sift the clumps through to a waste drawer, then rotates back to settle the litter.</p>
<p>The Litter-Robot includes more settings than many of the other litter boxes, which is helpful for pet owners who want more customization. You can adjust its timer to decide how long after a cat uses the litter box to activate cleaning mode. This box comes with a programmable sleep mode as well.</p>

It enables you to use regular litter, and it boasts one of the more advanced cleaning methods with its unique rotating sifting system.</p><a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Litter-Robot.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The setup and waste removal were the easiest among its competitors. Like our top pick, it only needs to be plugged into an outlet to work. When it came time to remove the collected waste, you simply pulled out the waste tray underneath and dumped it out. Additionally, the waste tray is large, which cuts back on the frequency of maintaining its cleanliness to every two weeks. When it ran through its clean cycle, the noise was never an issue. That being said, it was a bit slower than the other models we tested.</p>
<p>A few areas in which the Litter-Robot fell short were its entrance and imposing size. While the design is remarkable, almost like a mini rocket ship, it doesn’t blend discreetly into your home decor and takes up a lot of space. The entry to the litter box was also a hindrance to our larger and older cat, Kit Kat, and made it difficult for him to use.</p>
<p>While Kit Kat never quite got accustomed to using the steeper vertical entrance, Jelly Bean eventually became less daunted by the entryway and used it quite frequently. However, she is a smaller and more active cat. So keep in mind, it would be less convenient for older cats. Litter-Robot does sell a separate <a href="https://www.litter-robot.com/accessories/lr3-ramp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ramp</a> that you can place in front of the entrance to help out older cats.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Litter-Robot is a premium product with a premium price — more than double the cost of our top pick. It is not a cost-effective solution, especially if you want more than one automatic litter box in your home. We also would need to purchase a ramp to make the entry more accessible, which adds another $50 to the cost. That being said, if you’re able to foot the bill and can make room for it in your home, the Litter-Robot is an exceptional automatic litter box that lives up to expectations.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Litter-Robot’s impressive patented rotating and sifting cleaning system did the most thorough job of cleaning the litter</li>
<li>It also allows you to use the clay litter your cat is used to</li>
<li>The Litter-Robot has a remarkably easy setup, waste removal, and maintenance</li>
<li>Its large size might be too imposing for some homes, and its entryway is difficult for older/less active cats</li>
<li>Its price tag is highest among automatic litter box competitors</li>

<p>The PetSafe was unique in that it used specialized crystal litter. Instead of clumping, the litter absorbs urine. Unfortunately, it doesn’t do nearly as well at covering the smell of feces. Moreover, bits would often get stuck on the rake. This was one of the quietest among its competitors, but that’s because the motor that pushed the rake was not as powerful.</p>
<p>It also comes with a hood that can help with its odor issues but may make the opening too small for larger cats to enter.</p>
<p><strong>That being said, the PetSafe was one of the easiest boxes to clean.</strong> With its disposable litter trays, all you had to do was lift the plastic top off, remove the cardboard litter tray, throw it out and install a new one. Some nice-to-have features that add to the litter box’s value are a health counter (which tracks how many times your cat uses the box) and an adjustable timer.</p>

<p>The LitterMaid was a pretty standard self-cleaning litter box. It uses normal clumping litter and a rake to push clumps into the waste receptacle. Carbon filters included with each of the waste receptacles kept odor under control. Clean up was as easy as throwing away the waste receptacle and replacing it with a new one.</p>
<p>The carpeted ramp was nice since it made it easier for cats to get in the litter box and also helped prevent litter from tracking outside of it. It also has an optional sleep timer to deactivate it at night.</p>
<p>However, a big issue was that feces would get stuck fairly often on the rake, although there was a scooper included that made it easy to remove. <strong>Since the track for the rake is on the inside of the litter box, sometimes litter (or even worse, feces) would get on the track.</strong> When that happened, the rake would grind very loudly as it ran, like someone sharpening a pencil. This means extra maintenance was required, which detracted from how convenient using this litter box was otherwise.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://share.litter-robot.com/lS7vb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CatGenie</a> was the most unique and complex litter box. It uses biodegradable plastic granules instead of regular litter and is connected to your toilet/water line. The system rotates the granules into the scooper and emulsifies the solid waste by adding water to it. It then flushes the granules with water in its “SaniSolution,” and finally blows warm air to heat and dry the granules. The benefit of it being connected to your toilet/water line is that there is no manual disposal of waste required.</p>
<p>The cleaning cycle is very loud. Since it blows warm air during the drying cycle, it heats the area around it as well. <strong>The 30-minute cleaning cycle is quite long and also sounds like an open dishwasher running through a wash cycle.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, the plastic granules are unfamiliar to a cat used to clumping litter.  With all these factors in play, it was one of the most intimidating litter boxes for our cats to use. Due to the way it cleans, we were unable to add clumping litter to at least give it a recognizable scent. Jelly Bean used it to pee once and Kit Kat would not go near it at all.</p>
<p>The lack of familiar design, loud cleaning cycle and foreign litter can be a deterrent for an easy litter box transition. It also took up a substantial amount of space and its required hook-up to a water line made for an inconvenient setup and location.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Sometimes simple is best. <strong>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MA2T9BC/?tag=ybdlttr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pet Zone &#8211; SmartScoop</a> did exactly what it was supposed to do. It cleaned itself without you noticing.</strong> Plus, it’s reasonably priced.

<p>If you have a shredder at home, you can easily make your own cat litter with three ingredients: newspaper and paper scraps, baking soda and water. Simply use your shredder to shred any scrap paper from around the house such as old newspapers, junk mail or documents you plan to recycle. Place the shredded paper in a deep bucket, and pour water over it letting it soak for around 5 minutes. Then, grab the shredded paper by hand and squeeze out all of the water, but avoid doing it over the sink as it could clog your drains. Once you make sure the shredded paper is as dry as possible, mix in baking soda — we prefer to use 1 cup of baking soda per 5 cups of wet paper shreds. Place the mixture in a single layer at the bottom of a container, allowing to to dry, in the sun if possible.</p>
<p>When it comes time to use your homemade cat litter, add more baking soda to the bottom of your litter box prior to using the mixture each time you replace it to keep your litter box smelling fresh.</p>
<h3>Chicken Feed Cat Litter</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14470" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed.jpg" alt="chicken feed" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chicken-feed-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Did you know that chicken feed is a common alternative to store-bought cat litter?</p>
<p>It’s much less expensive and is a great alternative to cat litter due to its texture. It’s recommended to use a chicken feed that doesn’t have any antibiotics or medication in it to ensure your cat’s safety. Note that chicken feed can attract bugs, so make sure you are storing it in an airtight container and change our the litter box regularly.</p>
<p>If the smell becomes too potent, add baking soda to the mixture to help cover up the scent.</p>
<h3>Cedar Shavings</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14471" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings.jpg" alt="cedar shavings" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cedar-shavings-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Although only one ingredient, we couldn’t go without mentioning the use of cedar shavings as cat litter. Not only is the material budget-friendly, but it’s known for covering up odor with a natural wood scent. There are brands that market cedar cat litter, but you can also purchase cedar chips from a local hardware store to save some money. It’s also worth noting that cedar is known to repel insects, but it’s still recommended to change it out regularly.</p>
<h3>Essential Oil Refresher</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14475" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils.jpg" alt="essential oils" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/essential-oils-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Sometimes it’s difficult to avoid the smell of cat litter even if you change it out regularly. Although this deodorizer can’t be used as cat litter itself, it’s a great way to add a refreshing scent to your cat litter. Simply add baking soda to a jar or bag, then drop a couple drops of essential oils to it — our favorite scent to use is lavender. Shake up the mixture and let it sit overnight. Then, sprinkle it over your cat litter whenever you need a refresher.</p>
<p>Cats can be picky when it comes to their cat litter — something we found with our own kitties, Jelly Bean and Kit Kat. If you’re planning to transition your adult cats to a new cat litter, make sure you do so slowly. You may want to consider mixing their accustomed cat litter with your homemade version to make the transition comfortable and familiar to them. Remember that you may need to try a few formulas before you find one that sticks.</p>
<p>Once your homemade cat litter is ready, print out one of our cat litter labels and adhere it to the container!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e took six top competitors over sandy beaches and rocky hills to determine that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Collapsible Wagon</a> is the best folding wagon.

<p>Unlike many of the other products we test at Your Best Digs, there was very little information available online regarding folding wagons. In addition, there are very few established brands that we could use as a reference point.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we dug deep into the Amazon reviews of the most popular folding wagons and read through blog posts and articles that mentioned specific folding wagons as standout options for consumers.</p>
<p>From there, we narrowed our list of products to those that could comfortably carry enough cargo for a day at the beach or for a group of tailgaters.</p>
<p>This left us with a list of five finalists. We ordered the finalists and tested them extensively over the course of one month.</p>
<h2 id="the-five-best">Compare the best folding wagons</h2>
[table id=15 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested the wagons</h2>
<p>We used each of the outdoor utility wagons in a series of everyday situations. These included walking to and from our downtown office to the car, as well as carrying cargo at the beach, along gravel and dirt roads, and up and down hills.</p>
<p>In addition to real-world testing, we looked at several different features and metrics to compare each of the finalists against one another.</p>
<p>Folding wagons are used to carry anything from tailgating gear (some will fit your favorite <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-coolers/">cooler</a>!), to <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-pet-insurance/">pets</a>, and sometimes even your little ones. This means that one of the most important aspects of any wagon is the quality of materials used and sturdy construction.</p>
<p>For each of the five finalists, we looked at how sturdy they were, how easily the material stretched and ripped, and whether there were any early signs of wear and tear that could indicate problems down the line.</p>
<p>We also looked at the general stability of each wagon, including how easy or difficult it was to expand and collapse.</p>

<p>The size and type of wheels used by each folding wagon were considered as well. Our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty</a>, has oversized wheels that made movement over tough terrain significantly easier.</p>
<p>Next, we measured how much weight each wagon could comfortably hold. While each of the wagons had a recommended “maximum weight”, we were more interested in practical weight limits, not “technical maximums”.</p>
<p>Put another way, we wanted to know how much weight each wagon could reliably carry without tipping or otherwise becoming cumbersome to use. We also measured the volume inside each wagon (length x width x height).</p>
<p>We also tested each wagon to see how easy or difficult it was to tip over. We tested this by turning the wheels at a 90-degree angle and pulling sharply. This process was repeated with the wagons empty, with 20 pounds of cargo, and at each of their maximum weights.</p>

<p>If you ever had (or saw) one of the red Radio Flyer wagons as a child, you understand how useful (and fun!) having a wagon can be. Folding wagons incorporate many of the benefits of a wagon like the Radio Flyer while also being lighter, more portable, and capable of reliably carrying more cargo.</p>
<p>If you enjoy tailgating, or simply need a way to transport supplies to and from the beach, lake, etc, a folding wagon can simplify the process significantly.</p>
<p>Wagons are great for running errands as well. Whether you’re bringing groceries into the house or starting a gardening project in your backyard, a folding wagon can help get everything from the car to wherever it needs to be.</p>
<p>A reliable wagon can help ensure that all of your food, drinks and anything else you need get from point A to point B gets there safely, and without anyone needing to carry everything in your arms.</p>
<p>If you have tired children (or pets) that need a break from walking, putting them in a folding wagon is a fun way to bring them along for the ride – just make sure to pay attention to weight maximums.</p>
<h2>Folding wagons vs strollers</h2>
<p>In 2019 we compared the best double strollers with wagons. There are a few advantages wagons have over strollers.</p>
<p>For one, wagons fold flatter, so they&#8217;re easier to store and transport in your car. Folding and unfolding is also easier than on most strollers.</p>
<p>Another perk is room: a collapsible wagon for kids is basically a small playpen on wheels. You can even get oversized four-seat wagons like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMD77BS/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Wonder Fold XXL</a> that carry more kids than any stroller we&#8217;ve seen. Even strollers with lay-flat seats or bassinet attachments don&#8217;t have as much extra room as a wagon.</p>
<p>The sacrifices you&#8217;ll make moving from a stroller to a wagon are fairly serious, though. For one thing, sitting in a wagon with your legs stretched out isn&#8217;t very comfortable, so most kids will prefer riding around for hours in a sit-up stroller seat.</p>
<p>Car seat adapters are also tricky: yes, you can pull a carseat around loose in a wagon, but it&#8217;s not secure. Think very carefully about how you intend to use a wagon with a small infant in it. The best infant carseats like the group we reviewed are all designed to be safe when secured to a stroller, and manufacturers will issue recalls if they find out about ways infants might be in danger. With a wagon, you&#8217;re on your own to make sure that a car seat doesn&#8217;t roll around.</p>
<p>Wagons are also far less maneuverable than strollers. You can still get them most places if you&#8217;re careful, but it&#8217;s like trading a minivan for an 18-wheeler. Since the beginning of 2019, a Walt Disney World and Disneyland wagon ban explicitly prohibits bringing a wagon into the parks to prevent traffic jams; most double strollers are still within the new size limits. Other parks and malls still allow wagons, but it&#8217;s not hard to see how hundreds of them in the same footpath have caused problems.</p>
<p>On the whole, if you have multiple kids but don&#8217;t need a double stroller every day, a wagon is a cost-effective and versatile way to let your older child take a break on your longer mall trips. It&#8217;ll also help you carry your shopping.</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll want to think about is what the wagon will be used for. If you frequently go to the beach, you’ll want to make sure that the wagon you choose can handle sandy (or other rough) terrain. If, on the other hand, you are using the wagon in tight hallways or other areas where there isn’t much room to maneuver, it will be useful to have a wagon with a smaller turn radius, which is where the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Wagon</a> is without question the leader.</p>
<p>It’s also worth considering how much cargo space you’ll need. If you’re just transporting some groceries, a smaller wagon is probably enough. If, on the other hand, you plan on transporting a child (or pet), or if you need to carry a lot of cargo, a larger wagon makes more sense.</p>
<p>The terrain your wagon will traverse is important to think about as well. If your wagon will be rolling over sidewalks and driveways for the most part, smaller and thinner wheels &#8212; like the wheels on the smaller <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> &#8212; can be easier and more efficient.</p>
<p>If you plan on going over gravel, sand or anything else difficult to traverse, a more rugged wheel will get the job done, while still being easy enough to use on flatter terrain as well.</p>
<p>Finally, consider the amount of easy storage space you have available for your wagon. One of the most significant advantages of using a folding wagon is that it takes up less space when it is not in use. Folding wagons also fit more easily into smaller vehicles, so getting them to and from wherever you plan to use this is more practical than a “fixed” wagon.</p>
<p>If you have limited storage space (e.g. you live in an apartment), a folding wagon that folds significantly smaller than its unfolded size is particularly useful as well.</p>

<p>After using all of the wagons extensively over a one-month period, we determined that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Collapsible Wagon</a> was the best among our finalists for use on mud and sand. If you&#8217;re moving it over tougher terrain or carrying bigger loads it&#8217;ll meet your demands without complaints.</p>
<p>While all five of our finalists worked fairly well in our more general tests, The Mac Sports wagon also stood out as an overall winner because it combined durability and weight capacity with a tight turn radius and general ease of use.</p>
<p>Before we even started testing the wagons, the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty stood out as a premium product. Both the metal frame and the fabric are sturdy and capable of handling more than 100 pounds of cargo. In our month of heavy testing, we saw no signs of wear and tear, which indicates that the wagon should last for years without any issues.</p>
<h3>Best beach wagon</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3979 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03.jpg" alt="mac sports heavy duty" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-03-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>While there was plenty to like about the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty, one thing that quickly stood out from the rest of the field was dramatically-better steering, courtesy of the large wheels and sharp turn radius this wagon is capable of.</p>
<p>The more we tested the five finalists, the more we came to appreciate just how much better the steering is on the Mac Sports wagon. While it might seem like having four wheels in each corner would be more efficient, our testing found that having the two front wheels close to each other and, most importantly, directly connected to the steering handle, worked significantly better than the alternatives.</p>
<p>The width of the wheels was noteworthy as well. The wheels are significantly wider than they were on the other wagons, which made them far more capable of traversing sandy beaches and other rough and uneven terrains.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s even more important if you&#8217;re carrying anything heavy. Even if you&#8217;re only weighed down with a couple of big kids, wide wheels won&#8217;t sink as quickly in sand or mud.</p>
<p>The thing we liked most about the wheels, however, was the sharp turn radius they offered. Unlike the other four collapsible wagons we tested, the handle of the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty wagon is directly attached to the wheels themselves, giving the user direct control over the direction without needing to pull the wagon itself.</p>

<p>Finally, the oversized plastic wheels were also easier to clean than the other finalists. While rubber might seem like a more durable choice, the sturdy plastic used by the Mac Sports wagon showed essentially zero damage during our testing, and was also significantly easier to clean – a major plus for those who’d rather not track mud and dirt through their home.</p>
<h3>Handle</h3>
<p>The telescopic handle, while featured to some extent on all of our finalists, was best executed on the Mac Sports wagon. The telescoping handle was flexible enough for both a 5-foot-2-inch individual and a six-foot individual, and the handle itself is easy to pull, turn, and maneuver.</p>

<p>In addition, the handle fits into a “dock” when not in use so that you don’t have to pick it up from the ground, or snap it into place every time (as was the case with other finalists).</p>
<h3>Design and ergonomics</h3>
<p>One of the added benefits of having two of the wheels front and center came when folding the wagon for storage and transportation. The wheels are able to line up with the outer wheels, reducing the folded footprint and making it easier to pull the wagon even when folded.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3980 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded.jpg" alt="mac sports folded" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-folded-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The volume, or capacity, of the Mac Sports wagon cart was solid as well – however all of our finalists were able to carry considerable cargo, so if this is the <em>only</em> factor you&#8217;re considering, the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> might be a better option.</p>
<p>Finally, the two mesh cup holders make the Mac Sports wagon just a bit more useful, both for tailgating and going to the beach – as well as any other situation where you might want a place to put your beverages.</p>
<h3>Weight capacity</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3978 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled.jpg" alt="mac sports heavy duty filled with cargo" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Hero-Filled-360x240@2x.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Mac Sports claims that their wagon can carry up to 150 pounds of cargo. We put that weight to the test, and found that the wagon didn’t start groaning under the pressure until there was about 170 pounds of cargo inside.</p>
<p>That being said, in practice you should be carrying less than the maximum weight in this wagon. We found that up to about 80 pounds was very easy to carry, but there started to be minor maneuverability issues around 130 pounds. While you could technically carry 150 pounds in this wagon (and we did) we don’t recommend it.</p>
<h3>Some minor issues</h3>
<p>There was plenty to like about the Mac Sports wagon. However, there were a couple of issues we noticed during testing.</p>
<p>The first and most significant issue is the tipping risk we noticed when carrying heavy loads, and loads that went more than two feet over the top of the wagon. More specifically, we found that the Mac Sports wagon would tip if we turned the wheels to a 90-degree angle and pulled moderately hard on the handle.</p>
<p>While not ideal, the solution to this is to simply be careful when carrying large loads in the wagon. The tipping risk is essentially non-existent when carrying lighter loads, and was only an issue when turning tight corners quickly. Our final assessment was that this is a minor issue and a fair trade-off for the improved turn radius of the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Folding Wagon is a durable and versatile wagon that is both easy to use and efficient.</li>
<li>Large wheel treads make this the best beach wagon for pulling through sand and mud.</li>
<li>The design of the front wheels gives the wagon an exceptional turn radius while also somewhat reducing stability on sharp turns.</li>
<li>The wagon offers an excellent ratio of cargo capacity to folded size.</li>

<p>When we started researching folding wagons, we weren’t aware of any brand that was synonymous with this particular niche market. While we still wouldn’t say that there is an overwhelming dominant brand for folding wagons, it became clear through our testing that Mac Sports knows what they are doing.</p>
<p>While the Mac Sports Heavy Duty Wagon was our top pick overall, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> was a respectable runner-up for garden wagon use. While it doesn’t have the versatility of the heavy-duty variant, this wagon is a strong option for those who aren’t planning to travel over rougher terrain. That, in conjunction with a considerably lower price point, makes the Mac Sports Utility Wagon a strong contender for second place.</p>
<h3>Things we liked</h3>
<p>Many of the things we liked about the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty are also present in this utility wagon. The durability was the most readily apparent of these, along with the telescoping handle. The cargo capacity for the Mac Sports wagon was impressive as well, with 3.62 cubic feet of cargo space inside the compartment itself (not including anything stacked above).</p>

Great for grocery shopping, tailgating and other light uses.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>This wagon was also very easy to fold and unfold – much like its “big brother”.</p>
<p>The price was a significant factor as well. At the time of publishing this article, this wagon was about half the cost of the Heavy Duty variant (about $60 versus about $120). This is a significant difference, and those who are looking to save some money should absolutely consider this version before going for the heavy-duty variant.</p>
<h3>What we didn’t like</h3>
<p>Overall, this version of the Mac Sports wagon is worthy of serious consideration. However, the wheels are significantly less versatile when compared to our top pick. In addition, while Mac Sports does claim that the maximum weight is 150 pounds, we found that the wagon became fairly difficult to maneuver with about 80 pounds of cargo.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3991" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison.jpg" alt="wheel comparison" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison.jpg 900w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-180x120.jpg 180w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wagons-Wheel-Comparison-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Realistically, we wouldn’t want to transport more than 50 or 60 pounds in this wagon – except for short distances or when absolutely necessary. It will work with 100+ pounds of cargo, but it really shines at lower weights.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon is a less expensive alternative to our top pick, the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Wagon.</li>
<li>The maximum useful weight capacity caps out at around 60 to 70 pounds.</li>
<li>This wagon is best suited for lighter functions, such as transporting groceries or as a garden wagon.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Radio Flyer &#8211; 3-in-1 EZ Fold Wagon with Canopy</a> is the best wagon for big kids and littles spending a day at the park or at the mall. It doesn&#8217;t have all the rugged features of our other top picks, but the canopy and seat belts make it an easy win for parents.</p>
<p>Radio Flyer is an iconic brand in the world of wagons, so a successful new fold up wagon design needed to pass all our major tests in order to be worthy of the name. Fortunately, this is a great folding wagon for kids.</p>
<p>The 3-in-1 EZ Fold version of the folding Radio Flyer wagon comes with and without a canopy, or in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OD3EVDW/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an &#8220;ultimate&#8221; model</a> with elevated seats to make long rides slightly more comfortable for kids older than two. The bigger seats make the bed of the wagon less versatile, though, and there&#8217;s a hefty price premium for a pretty limited improvement in comfort.</p>
<p>The lap belt restraints were just enough to keep our tester&#8217;s nine-month-old baby and three-year-old child seated on walks. It&#8217;s not a five-point harness, and if you&#8217;ve got a car seat around that will fit inside (like our top pick for <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-infant-car-seat/">best infant car seat</a>) that&#8217;s the best way to keep a curious baby from climbing out.</p>
<p>This was the only folding wagon we tested with a canopy, and it makes all the difference on a sunny summer day. When we tested during a 4th of July parade, we quickly found nearby friends scooting their folding chairs closer to take advantage of the shade.</p>

This wagon isn't quite as rugged as our top pick, but it's perfect for moving your kids and their stuff around.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The canopy supports slide into the four corners of the wagon for folding or when you don&#8217;t want the obstruction, and the canopy itself neatly packs into a pocket on the back of the wagon. The folded size is about the same as other models we tested, quite a bit smaller and easier to pack in the car or van than a folded stroller.</p>
<p>Another unique attribute is that one side of the wagon bed unzips, turning your wagon into a bench. You wouldn&#8217;t want to pull it around with legs dangling, but if you&#8217;re parked (as we did at a parade) the bench mode is quite comfortable for three bigger kids who just need a place to sit.</p>

<p>The Radio Flyer isn&#8217;t as easy to roll around when folded as our top pick. And despite the advantages of a built-in canopy on a sunny day, we still prefer the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty if you want to have your kids in the wagon while it&#8217;s going over surfaces that aren&#8217;t paved.</p>
<p>That said, the corner-mounted wheels on the Radio Flyer are more stable if you make a sharp turn while you&#8217;re moving quickly. That&#8217;s a safety benefit most parents will probably want to take.</p>
<p>If you really want to go all-in on a folding wagon for your kids, there are premium options available from companies like Keenz and Veer, but at prices around $400 or $600 these wagons aren&#8217;t offering much more than the Radio Flyer or the Mac Sports wagons. We&#8217;ve also tested the best double strollers, and they&#8217;re more economical and far more comfortable for everyone involved, though it is wider.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Radio Flyer lives up to the legacy of classic kid wagons with the two-seater <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EZ Fold 3-in-1 with Canopy</a>.</li>
<li>A built-in canopy is quick to attach and provides great shade for summertime walks.</li>
<li>Maneuverability under load isn&#8217;t as good as the Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty.</li>
<li>The price is about the same as our beach wagon pick, so you&#8217;re trading big wheels for seatbelts and shade.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-others">Other finalists we tested</h2>
<p>The other three wagons performed the basic functions reasonable well. However, all three were the same price or more when compared to the Mac Sports duo – while also being less effective.</p>
<h3>Seina &#8211; Collapsible Folding Utility Wagon</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VPJLKXQ/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seina</a> wagon is more or less comparable to the Mac Sports Utility Wagon, both in terms of size and wheel type. However, we found the material to feel notably less “premium”, and in fact the material started to fray a bit towards the end of our testing period.</p>
<p>At the time this article was published, the price of the Seina was about the same as the Mac Sports Utility Wagon, so if that’s your budget we think you’re better off with the Mac Sports wagon.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011Q0CN48/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Creative Outdoors Wagon</a> is made from a durable fabric that is comparable to both versions of the Mac Sports Wagon. In addition, the heavy duty wheels were able to traverse sand and other rough terrain easily.</p>
<p>However, the maneuverability of this wagon was challenging, particularly when going up and down hills. At the time this article was published, the Creative Outdoor wagon was slightly more expensive than the Heavy Duty Mac Sports wagon. For the price, you’re much better off going with the Mac Sports version.</p>

<p>Since publishing our post, EasyGoProducts has released the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LR6G9KK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EasyGoWagon 2.0</a> (which we did not test) and completely removed traces of their old wagon we tested from Amazon, but we&#8217;ll leave our notes below so you have an idea of our test results on version 1.0.</p>
<p>The EasyGoWagon 1.0 was the most expensive wagon we tested, and the most disappointing. The wheels on the EasyGoWagon made it difficult to traverse any terrain other than sidewalks and streets, and the material started to wear out about halfway through our testing period.</p>
<p>This wagon is stable, and the metal frame is certainly durable, but the overall experience of using this wagon simply did not justify the price – especially when there are better options for less money.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>

<p>Folding wagons are incredibly useful in a number of situations (they&#8217;re perfect for nearly all outdoor activities — some even like to use them as garden carts!), most will fit in the trunk of your car, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KQH575E/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Heavy Duty Wagon</a> is the best we tested. The durable materials used and the wide range of situations this wagon is capable of taking on makes its price point well-worth it in our opinion.</p>
<p>However, if you only need a lighter-duty wagon, the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUUUIGK/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mac Sports &#8211; Utility Wagon</a> can save you some money for a quick beach trip or picnic.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re a parent, the best wagon for kids (or pets!) is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTUGC5K/?tag=ybdwagn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Radio Flyer – 3-in-1 EZ Fold Wagon with Canopy</a>. The canopy makes all the difference, whether you&#8217;re facing a blazing hot afternoon at the beach or a long walk in the rain.</p>
