				<description><![CDATA[After testing the top-selling brands, we've picked the Rubbermaid - Roughneck as the best storage containers for closet and garage.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter testing seven different types of containers side-by-side and taking a close look at materials, we&#8217;re confident that the classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KBJ46LK/?tag=ybdstorcon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Roughneck</a> bin is still the best storage container. These polyethylene tubs are tough, so they won&#8217;t shatter in cold storage or when dropped like most bins will. If you&#8217;ve got less demanding needs, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MWTJX2S/?tag=ybdstorcon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ziploc &#8211; Weathershield</a> containers let you see what&#8217;s inside, they&#8217;re water-tight and they come in stackable combinations.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>Our test team has been using storage containers to organize nearly every part of their eclectic lives: In homes, on the farm, at warehouses and even for travel. Over the years, our testers have bought numerous brands and styles of storage containers for different applications. Some have served faithfully for decades in storage sheds, while some were only good for a year before cracking.</p>
<p>We carefully examined lids and materials on all the bins we could find at four different retailers, and cross-referenced with online reviews from sites like Wirecutter, Art of Cleanliness, and Reddit.</p>
<h3>The beloved classic</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KBJ46LK/?tag=ybdstorcon-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Roughneck</a> containers are made of flexible, tough polyethylene, and most discussion board posts we read agree that they&#8217;re the gold standard for rugged and reliable storage.</p>
<p>The downside we saw immediately to the Roughneck is that many retailers have stopped keeping them on store shelves and require you to buy sets of six or eight tubs to justify the not-exactly-free shipping.</p>
<p>Sadly, most retailers are now mostly stocking alternatives that only look similar to Rubbermaid&#8217;s styling. In a few cases the polypropylene imitators had cracked while they were still on the store shelf.</p>
<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<p>We found one other affordable polyethylene bin, the Sterilite &#8211; Ultra, with better in-store availability and some design trade-offs. We dismissed other imitators that look more similar to Roughneck&#8217;s construction, but with the same availability issues and poor reviews.</p>
<p>We also sought out the most affordable containers we&#8217;d still trust to keep in storage and found a few options that have compelling features to make up for reduced durability compared to tough polyethylene bins.</p>
<p>We looked into sealed roto-molded containers from brands like Pelican and SKB, but the prices aren&#8217;t justifiable unless you&#8217;re transporting delicate devices to the field or on flights every day. Other large freight-quality shipping containers are a neat idea, but also too expensive for garage or closet storage. We did pick up a Rubbermaid &#8211; Brute commercial-grade container, to see just how much tougher it is to justify the big price jump over Roughneck bins.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Materials: Polyethylene vs. polypropylene &#8211;</b> Low-density polyethylene (stamped on the bottom as LDPE, recycling group number four) is more flexible than stiff, cheap polypropylene (recycling group five), so it won&#8217;t crack as easily if you drop a loaded bin on the garage floor. It also won&#8217;t become brittle at freezing temperatures the way polypropylene does.</p>

<p>Each material has some advantages. <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/lab-plasticware-supplies/plastic-material-selection/polypropylene-pp-labware.html#pp-physical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polypropylene</a> can be made see-through, and it&#8217;s much more heat resistant — all the way up to boiling temperatures. <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/lab-plasticware-supplies/plastic-material-selection/low-density-polyethylene-ldpe-labware.html#ldpe-physical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LDPE</a> is always tougher, but it gets very soft at temperatures above 110 degrees fahrenheit and melts in boiling water. Our testers have seen far more polypropylene bins fail in long-term storage, especially in cold climates, but in a baking-hot attic you&#8217;d want to be very careful about how much weight stack on an LDPE bin.</p>
<p><b>Latching lids &#8211;</b> A flip-up latch will hold your bin closed even if you over-stuff it, which is handy for things like bulky sweaters and puffy blankets. If you put too much strain on latches, though, they&#8217;re prone to pop out of the mounting holes. Those holes also mean an entry point for moisture and insects.</p>
<p><b>A waterproof seal &#8211;</b> If you just need a bin to shed rain, almost any will do: with one exception, the lids we tested cover the edge of the bin, which means water will roll off without getting inside. A totally sealed lid (like our top pick) will also keep out humidity, though damp items can mildew quickly if you&#8217;re not careful about what you put in the bin.</p>
<p><b>Stackable designs &#8211;</b> Nearly any bin can stand on top of another, but some designs are able to neatly mix and match small and large bins while creating a topple-resistant tower.</p>
<p><b>Single-size lids &#8211;</b> If you&#8217;re building a collection of storage containers to fully organize your life, it can be handy to have bins with same-size openings. This usually means you can stack and nest different sizes as well as sharing lids between them. Usually there will be at least two sizes in a series of containers with a common lid and footprint size, with the difference in volume made up by height.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>riginally used by therapists as a tool to soothe patients, weighted blankets have gone mainstream, used at home by the masses to calm anxiety and help insomnia. We bought four highly acclaimed weighted blankets to test, sleeping under each of them for multiple nights to judge their levels of comfort, breathability and soothing effect.</p>
<p>The best weighted blanket overall is the chemical-free <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a>, a luxurious, durable weighted duvet that felt cocoon-like yet breathable. With its cucumber-cool bamboo viscose outer shell, we felt cozy and comfortably cool all night under the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a>, making it our choice for the best cooling weighted blanket.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a weighted blanket?</h2>
<p>One <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b52/514a1b040f0b631168d98cfa9730cfc5a9dd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="&quot;noopener">study</a> that tracked the effects of weighted blankets on 30 participants aged 20 to 66 with chronic insomnia reported that the additional pressure from weighted blankets had a calming effect on the subjects. This, along with the secure “cocooned” feeling of being wrapped in a weighted blanket, decreased their muscle movement during sleep, resulting in better overall sleep quality.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20662681" target="_blank" rel="&quot;noopener">research</a> shows that weighted blankets shortens the time it takes for kids with ADHD to fall asleep, and also reduce middle-of-the-night wakeful periods. Weighted blankets have also been recommended for those on the autism spectrum and to help cope with anxiety, depression, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, sleepwalking and restless sleep in general.</p>
<p>The elderly and those with claustrophobia, breathing or circulation problems should consult with a health professional before using a weighted blanket. They are also not recommended for children under eight years old.</p>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>We first conducted an extensive online search to find which blankets had received high praise from trusted review sites, bloggers, YouTube reviewers and Reddit commenters. Since a weighted blanket can be a hefty investment, we wanted those in our testing lineup to be priced under $175 with good return policies, and also highly rated on Amazon.</p>
<p>Even though our review includes a separate category for the best cooling weighted blanket, we encountered so much online discussion about breathability that we decided to make it a key metric for all the blankets we tested. We also took note of other features that seemed to be especially important to buyers: whether the blanket is machine washable, comes with a duvet cover, etc.</p>
<p>Although the most well-known weighted blanket is arguably the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BNBFY52/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gravity Blanket</a> — the first weighted blanket brought to the mass market, via a 2017 Kickstarter campaign — we chose not to include it in our trials due to its weighty $249 price tag. (Affordability was a recurring theme in discussions online; we even came across Reddit threads discussing DIY weighted blanket projects.)</p>
<p>Instead, we selected the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a> — more reasonably priced (relatively) at about $149 — as a contender for the best weighted blanket overall. Known for its luxurious, long-lasting quality, breathability and excellent customer service, the Baloo brand promised to be worth the investment. For this category we also picked the Quility &#8211; Premium Adult Weighted Blanket, an Amazon customer favorite with a 4.8-star rating and nearly 9,000 reviews that comes with a fleece duvet.</p>
<p>For the best cooling weighted blanket category, the Zonli &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a> stood out as worthy contestants. Both made of breathable bamboo viscose, the blankets  received rave reviews from hot sleepers who were initially wary of feeling stifled under weighted blankets.</p>

<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>For adults, manufacturers generally recommend choosing a weighted blanket that’s about 10 percent of your body weight, give or take a few pounds. For children and those with mobility issues, the 10 percent rule still applies, but err on the side of a lighter blanket rather than a heavier one.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Normally, the size of a blanket should match the size of your bed (i.e. a twin blanket for a twin bed, king for king, etc.). But because weighted blankets are heavy, if any excess material falls over the end or sides of the bed, it will either weigh too heavy on the sleeper, or drag the rest of the blanket onto the floor.</p>
<p>Weighted blankets are usually sized to keep this from happening; for example, if you buy a queen-size blanket, it should only reach the edges of a queen bed’s surface without any overhang. However, it’s a good idea to check the actual measurements of the blanket before ordering one.</p>
<h3>Glass beads vs. plastic pellets</h3>
<p>The weights inside a weighted blanket will come in one of two forms: glass microbeads or small plastic pellets. The only real difference between the two is that the glass beads are tiny and sand-like, whereas plastic pellets are a bit larger and less weighty. This means a glass-bead blanket will be thinner than a plastic-pellet one.</p>
<h3>Washability</h3>
<p>There will come a point when your weighted blanket will need a wash. Although many weighted blankets are advertised as machine washable,  the manufacturer will often recommend spot cleaning instead. In light of this (and because weighted blankets are so cumbersome), we urge you to buy a duvet cover for your blanket, which will allow you to wash the blanket itself as little as possible.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Our testers slept under each of the weighted blankets in our lineup for three nights, then rated them using the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well did you sleep under this blanket?</li>
<li>How comfortable and soothed did you feel?</li>
<li>Did you feel uncomfortably warm during the night?</li>
<li>How would you rate the feeling of the blanket’s exterior shell?</li>
<li>How well is the weight distributed throughout the blanket?</li>
<li>How would you rate the quality of the blanket’s construction?</li>
<li>How would you rate the aesthetic look of the blanket?</li>
<li>How easy is this blanket to wash/dry/care for?</li>
<li>Does the blanket come with a duvet cover?</li>
<li>Is this blanket worth the price?</li>

<p>Our top pick for best weighted blanket overall is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a>. Made with premium, chemical-free cotton and lead-free glass microbeads dispersed amongst polyester fill, the Baloo was luxurious and cozy to sleep under. It was also quite breathable; we didn’t feel too warm once throughout the testing period.</p>
<p>Right down to the ribbon-tied welcome note inside its blanket box, Baloo is all about the details, even offering three free downloadable tracks of soothing meditative music to fall asleep to. While the fill weights in many weighted blankets are contained by a grid of squares alone, the Baloo blanket features unique double-quilted stitching, creating channels of piping that run between the squares as well. This means more support for the heavy glass beads inside, as well as more evenly distributed weight throughout the blanket.</p>
<p>Baloo is a green company, meaning their blankets contain zero harmful chemicals and are certified vegan. The blankets also machine washable in cold water on the gentle cycle, and can be dried in the dryer on low heat. As far as return policies go, Baloo’s is one of the more lenient that we came across, encouraging customers to take some time to get used to the weight of the blanket. You have 30 days to initiate a return, as long as the blanket is sent back in its original condition.</p>

<p>Out of the four blankets we tested, the Baloo offers the least sizing and weight options; only two sizes (twin and queen) and three weights (12, 15 and 20 pounds) are available. The blanket also only comes in one color — Pebble White — and doesn’t include a duvet cover, though the company does sell them separately. Although the blanket itself is well-designed and has the look of a high-end duvet, we recommend protecting it with a cover so you won’t have to go to the trouble of washing it often.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket feels luxe and cocoon-like, without sacrificing breathability.</li>
<li>The blanket is certified vegan and contains no harmful chemicals.</li>
<li>With double-quilted stitching, the Baloo is well-constructed to distribute weight evenly and prevent seam breaks.</li>
<li>This blanket only comes in twin and queen sizes, offers 12, 15 and 20-pound options and doesn’t include a duvet cover.</li>

<p>With a 300-thread-count bamboo viscose shell that’s cool to the touch, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a> gets our vote for the best cooling weighted blanket. Though certainly not light and airy, the blanket didn’t feel too dense, and we remained well-ventilated throughout the night. However, if you’re a hot sleeper, keep in mind that this is the only blanket you’ll need on your bed.</p>
<p>We were impressed with the YnM blanket’s construction, which is designed to prevent seam breaks and tearing. Underneath the bamboo outer layer, there’s an extra layer of cotton fabric to better contain the thin, breathable layer of polyfill and lead-free glass beads inside. The stitching is also clearly strong and high quality. Although the blanket is technically machine washable (on the delicate cycle), YnM recommends spot cleaning the blanket instead.</p>
<p>What really sold us on the YnM blanket was its three-year free mending guarantee. If any unexpected damage should come to your blanket within three years of purchase, YnM will repair it for you (though you will need to pay for shipping). They also offer a 30-day return policy on their blankets, as long as they are sent back with the original packaging.</p>

<p>The blanket itself does not come with a duvet cover, but YnM sells a variety of reasonably priced covers in three fabrics — cotton, bamboo and “minky” fleece — which come in tasteful solid colors and surprisingly chic patterns. If you need more warmth when the seasons change, the fleece duvet would be a great addition to take the cooling blanket from summer to winter use.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket’s high-thread-count bamboo viscose outer layer is silky soft and cool to the touch.</li>
<li>The blanket features high-quality stitching and construction that will stand the test of time.</li>
<li>YnM offers an unbeatable three-year mending guarantee on their weighted blanket (though customers must pay shipping).</li>
<li>No duvet cover is included.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Other weighted blankets we tested</h2>
<p>Although the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLHD2RX/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quility &#8211; Premium Adult Weighted Blanket</a> was cozy to sleep under with well-distributed weight, we grew uncomfortably warm during the night under its minky duvet cover, which seems to only be usable in cold climates during the winter. Without the cover, the blanket’s cotton outer layer felt a bit rough against our skin, and was quite plain compared to its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo</a> competitor.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM</a> blanket, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075W9VSW7/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zonli &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a> remained comfortably cool during the night, but the company’s return policy concerned us — Zonli offers no refunds on used blankets, only those that are returned unopened in their original packaging. Since high prices showed up as a top concern for weighted blanket buyers online, this bumped the Zonli down to second place in our cooling weighted blanket category.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>With weighted blankets now being marketed to the masses to help improve sleep and soothe anxiety and depression, they’re worth a try — as long as they include a good return policy.</p>
<p>Made of breathable, chemical-free cotton and featuring strong double-quilted stitching and a generous 30-day return policy, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N442PLC/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Baloo &#8211; Weighted Blanket</a> is a great choice for anyone in the market for a high-quality, luxurious weighted blanket.</p>
<p>For those who sleep hot, we recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C193MKM/?tag=ybdwdblnkt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YnM &#8211; Cooling Weighted Blanket</a>, made with silky, cooling 300-thread-count bamboo viscose and featuring durable construction and a three-year mending guarantee.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the past several weeks, we researched, snoozed and snored our way through seven finalists to determine that the best pillow for neck pain is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a>. This gel-infused shredded memory foam pillow offers down-like comfort and had our testers waking up the next morning refreshed and pain-free. We also liked our two runners-up: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IWM6056/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature&#8217;s Guest</a> supportive microfiber pillow and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075312Y9Y/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perform Pillow</a>’s contoured memory foam.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began by reading up on causes of neck pain and the importance of sleep in general. Next, we explored pillow recommendations from a variety of blogs and articles written by sleep experts. We took into account our previous experience with pillows in our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/">review of the best pillow for side sleepers</a>. We also investigated pillow ratings and user reviews from major retailers like Amazon, Bed Bath and Beyond, Target and Walmart.</p>
<p>While keeping in mind that choosing the right pillow involves a certain amount of personal preference, we ultimately selected seven pillows noted for their ability to provide strong cervical spine support and therefore prevent and/or resolve neck pain. (The cervical spine refers to the seven vertebrae that form the neck.) Our selections are primarily designed for side and back sleepers —  side and back are usually the best sleeping positions for reducing neck pain — and represent a range of materials and price points.</p>

<h2 id="causes">What causes neck pain?</h2>
<p>Neck pain can be the result of <a href="https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/neck-pain/neck-pain-causes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a variety of causes</a>, but the most common one is injury. Neck strains and sprains can be caused by sports, repetitive motions, poor posture (particularly from time spent at the computer or looking down at a phone), whiplash or sleeping in the wrong position.</p>
<p>Age is another factor that can contribute to neck pain as joints become worn out over time. Certain diseases that we are more prone to in our elder years, like arthritis or cancer, can also be contributing factors.</p>
<p>Other causes include stress and anxiety, being overweight or obese and, unfortunately, lack of sleep.</p>
<p>Your favored sleep position also plays an important role. Of the three common sleep positions — back, side and stomach — back or side sleeping are most recommended to avoid neck pain.</p>
<p>Stomach sleeping is not advised because this position requires the head and neck to twist to the side, which places pressure on delicate nerves. Changing your sleep position to either your back or side, while challenging for habitual stomach sleepers, may help resolve chronic neck pain issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spine-health.com/wellness/sleep/pillows-neck-pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spine Health</a> advises that sleeping with the right type of pillow for your sleeping position can help your neck pain. Sleep experts recommend choosing one that contours to the shape of your head and neck. Pillows that are malleable and/or adjustable can be helpful to achieve the desired contour. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/say-good-night-to-neck-pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard Health</a> advises that you avoid pillows which are too high or too stiff.</p>
<p>Back sleepers are usually better off with thinner pillows and side sleepers with something thicker — but the right pillow thickness also depends on the width of your shoulders, size of your head and firmness of your mattress.</p>
<p>Pillows are made from a wide variety of materials, including feathers, down, down alternatives, memory foam, latex, gel fibers and polyester. Pillows that maintain their loft and don’t collapse under the weight of your head are recommended to help alleviate neck pain.</p>
<p>Be sure to contact your doctor if neck pain is severe, lasts for several days without relief, spreads down arms or legs, or is accompanied by headache, numbness, weakness or tingling.</p>
<h2 id="health">How sleep affects your health</h2>
<p>Sleep, of course, impacts your overall health. Lack of sleep can negatively affect your physical health by causing weakened immunity, increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, weight gain and — we now know — neck pain. Cognitively, poor sleep can result in problems with concentration and memory. Emotionally, not getting enough sleep often leads to irritability, anxiety and even depression.</p>
<p>Tips for better sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adults should aim for at least seven hours each night.</li>
<li>Always go to bed and get up around the same time.</li>
<li>Exercise regularly.</li>
<li>Avoid caffeine, alcohol, sugar, extra water and large meals before bed.</li>
<li>Manage stress.</li>
<li>Be wary of daylight-tinted blue light, especially from electronic screens. Read more about light and sleep in our review of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-night-light/">the best night lights</a>.</li>
<li>Keep your bedroom cool.</li>

<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Support</b> When it comes to addressing neck pain, your pillow’s primary job is to place your neck into a neutral position and hold it there while you sleep. Whether this support comes from contoured memory foam or a customizable water base, be sure that your pillow properly aligns your head, neck, shoulders and spine — in whatever your preferred sleeping position may be.</p>
<p><b>Adjustable loft</b> It is becoming increasingly common for pillow manufacturers to offer customization options that allow the user to add or remove filling at home. In some cases, pillow customization requires sending it back to the manufacturer. Water based pillows use varying amounts of water to adjust the pillow’s overall firmness and height.</p>
<p><b>Firmness/softness:</b> We recommend you choose a pillow that is firm enough to provide enough neck support, but soft enough that you enjoy the feeling of laying down to sleep. After all, you will (hopefully!) spend at least seven hours a night with your pillow. See “Materials” section below for more info.</p>
<p><b>Size:</b> Common sizes are standard, queen and king, which correspond to the size of the similarly named mattresses. Sheet sets often include pillowcases for corresponding pillows. Your preference will likely be affected by your own size, the size of your bed and how much you move around at night.</p>
<h3>Materials:</h3>
<p><b>Filling: </b>Some common pillow fills are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feathers and down &#8211; This fill is, warm, malleable, and breathable— but provides little neck support.</li>
<li>Memory foam &#8211; This man-made material will mold and contour around the head and neck. It offers good support and is durable. Memory foam retains heat and can have an unpleasant scent.</li>
<li>Shredded memory foam &#8211; Like standard memory foam pillows, these pillows are supportive and durable. They are also more moldable to contour around the head and neck.</li>
<li>Polyester gel fibers &#8211; A gel pillow is not actually filled with any liquid-like substance. Instead, the gel is infused into solid polyester fibers. The resulting fibers feel similar to down, but offer more support. This material is often used for its cooling properties.</li>
<li>Microfiber &#8211; This used to be the primary filling for pillows, but memory foam and latex pillows are now more popular since they tend to offer better support. Polyester is one common type of microfiber.</li>
<li>Latex &#8211; This material is breathable, soft to the touch and springs back quickly. It does not hold its loft as well as memory foam products do.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Covers: </b>A range of both natural and synthetic materials are used to cover pillows, including cotton, polyester and blends. Products derived from bamboo are popular recently and offer a soft, silky feel.</p>
<p>Consider whether the pillow cover is removable and machine-washable.</p>
<p><b>Allergies: </b>Many of the products we tested were hypoallergenic. Pillows containing materials like feathers or latex may cause issues for some sensitive individuals. People who are prone to dust allergies might also want to consider removable covers or machine-washable pillows for ease of laundering when making their decision.</p>
<p><b>Trial period: </b>Many pillow manufacturers offer trial periods. Some of these periods are advertised for as long as a year, but be sure to read the fine print. In some cases, the manufacturer only honors the trial period if you buy directly from them. Amazon typically offers a 30-day return policy.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pillow-testing.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Before testing, we unpacked our seven finalists and followed individual product instructions to prepare each pillow. Several came vacuum-compressed and needed time in the dryer to fluff up. The two water pillows required adding a measured amount of water via funnel and removing remaining air pockets. Others were ready to use right out of the box.</p>
<p>Next, we recruited three product testers to sleep with each of the pillows over a three week period On a scale of one to 10, they rated overall comfort levels each morning, and ranked pillow preferences based on how well they supported the neck region. All of our pillow testers identified as alternating between side and back sleeping positions and have experienced intermittent neck pain.</p>
<p>Finally, we closely inspected each pillow to assess its loft, overall support, lumpiness, thickness, softness, contour shape and any other features that caught our attention. We also explored customization options and overall ease of care.</p>

<p>All of our pillow testers agree that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a> is the best pillow for neck pain. This cross-cut, gel-infused memory foam and microfiber pillow is luxuriously comfortable, customizable and — most importantly — cradles your head and neck perfectly so that you remain pain-free and get a good night’s sleep. (Not surprisingly, Coop Home Goods was also picked as <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/">the best pillow for side sleeping</a>!)</p>
<p>The opulent experience begins when the Eden arrives on your doorstep. It comes beautifully packaged in a custom box, with a slogan announcing “A pillow as unique as you are.&#8221; As instructed, we prepared our pillow by placing it in the dryer on low for 10 minutes. Although there was a very slight off-gassing odor from the foam when we first received the product, this dissipated quickly.</p>
<p>The pillow comes complete with an extra bag of filling, which was a nice touch for anyone desiring additional support. Coop Home Goods suggests that side sleepers try the pillow as-is before adding foam. Back sleepers are encouraged to remove about a quarter of the foam from their pillow, and stomach sleepers to remove a third of the foam. Free customization assistance is also offered via a phone support line. Our testers felt that the Eden came with the right amount of filling right out of the box.</p>
<p>The filling is made from a combination of 80-percent visco-elastic foam (memory foam) with infused gel beads and 20-percent polyester fiber, which sounds sort of goopy, but in actuality feels very soft and down-like. The combination of foam and fibers is designed to prevent clumping and promote airflow, which keeps you both cool and comfortable. This particular foam is cross cut into very small pieces, which also helped avoid lumps.</p>

This pillow provides excellent support for sore necks.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The soft outer cover has gusseted edges, which help distribute the filling evenly regardless of your sleeping position. You can opt to sleep directly on this cover or use a traditional pillow case on top. It is made from polyester and viscose (derived from bamboo) and is nicely breathable and soft to the touch. The pillow has a zippered polyester inner cover which holds the filling when washing the outer cover.</p>
<p>The pillow feels heavy and firmer than a traditional poly-fill or down pillow, but it is still soft enough to welcome you to bed. We liked that the Eden was more fluffy than runners-up from Nature’s Guest or Perform Pillow without compromising neck support.</p>
<p>The best thing about the Eden was how well it held its loft under the pressure of one’s head and neck. We were pleasantly surprised by how such a cuddly, cloudlike pillow could also provide such strong support to keep our heads, necks and spines in alignment throughout the night.</p>
<p>To maintain the pillow, instructions state to place it in the dryer on low for 10 minutes every six months. Both the pillow and cover are machine-washable, but the agitation isn&#8217;t good for the foam.</p>
<p>This product is made in the USA. The manufacturer offers a 100-night trial, satisfaction guarantee and a 5-year warranty.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden offers cloudlike comfort while also providing excellent support for the head and neck region.</li>
<li>The pillow’s cross-cut gel-infused memory foam filling is down-like, evenly distributed and lump-free.</li>
<li>The luxuriously soft, bamboo-derived outer cover is huggable, breathable and washable.</li>
<li>A 100-night trial and five-year warranty are provided by the manufacturer.</li>

While not technically customizable, this contoured memory foam pillow can be used in one of four positions to adjust to different sized individuals and/or a variety of sleeping positions.</p>
<p>This pillow offers a very different sleeping experience than Coop Home Goods. Unlike our shredded memory foam winner, Perform Pillow’s single piece of foam can’t be manipulated and shaped around your bumps and curves; instead, you need to rely on its pre-formed shape. We tried the medium profile option though it also comes in thick or thin variations. While we found the contours worked well for us, some people may find that it takes a little getting used to.</p>
<p>The product states that it can take up to 2 weeks for your neck to fully adjust. Our testers were pleased to enjoy comfortable, sound sleep from the first use.</p>

<p>Made from Certi-PUR certified polyurethane foam, Perform Pillow comes ready-to-use right out of the box. Unlike some of the other foam pillows tested, it didn’t put off any unpleasant odor. Both long sides of the pillow have a different shaped contour, so you can choose which way you place it for the best fit. Alternatively, you can turn the pillow upside down and use either edge for two more positioning options. Two of our testers preferred using the contoured side up, with the higher shaped contoured edge supporting the neck; the other preferred the lower contour shape.</p>
<p>Perform’s soft and removable zippered cover is made from Kool-Flow, a bamboo-and-polyester fabric with a &#8220;micro-vented&#8221; texture. The cover is machine-washable in cold water and can be dried with low heat. If you choose to use the pillow in the inverted position, we recommend replacing the outer cover with a standard pillow case, since the zipper runs along the middle of the back side and would be uncomfortable to sleep on.</p>

<p>Like the Perform Pillow, this contoured, microfiber-filled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IWM6056/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature&#8217;s Guest &#8211; Support Pillow</a> takes some getting used to, but is well worth any adjustment period for the excellent cervical support it offers. Unlike the Perform or Eden, the unique shape allows for a specific sweet spot in the middle of the pillow that gives Nature’s Guest a particularly high-level of support.</p>
<p>This unusually shaped pillow — which boasts a patent-pending doctor-recommended design — provides the perfect resting place for your weary neck and helps maintain proper head, neck and spinal alignment while you sleep. Nature’s Guest is notably heavier and firmer than our other finalists and as a result, we weren’t expecting to find it particularly comfortable. We were wrong!</p>
<p>We found this pillow particularly beneficial for sleepers who move around a lot, such as when shifting from a side to back position. We liked that we could rest our head either in the center indented portion of the pillow, or along one of the higher, outer edges. This gave some flexibility through the night as sleeping positions shifted.</p>

<p>The pillow arrives vacuum-packed. You can opt to either fluff it by hand or place in the dryer for five minutes to inflate to normal size. The Nature’s Guest, which uses polyester fill, can then be customized by either removing some filling or putting extra inside. Like Coop Home Goods, Nature&#8217;s Guest ships their pillow with a bag of extra filling so there’s no need to send it back for customization.</p>
<p>The cotton cover is satin-trimmed with gusseted sides, which are particularly helpful for side sleeper support.  Zippered openings on both ends make customization simple.</p>
<p>Perhaps our biggest complaint is that this pillow requires hand washing. A customer satisfaction guarantee allows returns within 30 days for a full refund, no questions asked.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Nature’s Guest &#8211; Support Pillow has a uniquely shaped, contoured design that provides excellent cervical support.</li>
<li>Although heavy and firm, the well-designed shape allows for an extremely comfortable night’s rest.</li>
<li>The pillow can be customized by adding or removing microfiber fill.</li>
<li>Unlike most of our other finalists, this product is not machine washable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chiroflow &#8211; Water Pillow</h3>
<p>We were excited to try out the concept of an adjustable water pillow with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AHDIHSC/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chiroflow</a>. The experience was somewhat different than anticipated. While we found the pillow reasonably supportive of the head and neck, we didn’t have any obvious sensation of sleeping on water — other than a nagging fear that the pillow would leak in the middle of the night and we’d wake up in a puddle. (Don’t worry, that didn’t actually happen!)</p>
<p>The water bladder was located beneath a comfortably soft, thick layer of polyester fill and provided adjustable firmness. The water lent a hefty weight to the pillow, which helped keep it in place through the night.</p>
<p>We did notice a vague shifting sensation of the water redistributing when we moved around, but because it was below the padded layer, this sensation didn’t resemble anything like sleeping on a waterbed. So if you are prone to seasickness, don’t worry, we don’t think using this pillow will be a problem.</p>
<p>Initially customizing Chiroflow was a challenge. The detailed instructions recommended adding varying amounts of water based on your preferred sleeping position. A small plastic funnel is provided to assist this process and pouring in the water was simple. You can add any amount you like — the more water added, the firmer the pillow. Exact measurement recommendations are provided.</p>
<p>The challenging part was removing the remaining air pocket, which involved squeezing air out of the water bladder while simultaneously capping the opening and (hopefully) not getting water everywhere. If you don’t successfully remove the entire air pocket, you can hear (and feel) the water sloshing around, which interferes with a good night’s rest. Preparing the pillow properly required an extra set of hands.</p>
<p>Chiroflow, along with Mediflow — the other water pillow manufacturer whose pillow we tested — were the only finalists that proved their designs in clinical testing. An independent clinical study by Johns Hopkins ranked Mediflow &#8220;best&#8221; for how quickly subjects fell asleep, how few times subjects woke up, their perception of sleep compared to normal, overall quality of sleep and reduction of neck pain.</p>
<p>While Chiroflow wasn’t our top choice pillow for neck pain, the combination of comfortable fill and a responsive, supportive, adjustable water base make it a good option for neck support. Also, the entire pillow can be machine-washed and dried and comes with a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.</p>
<h3>Mediflow &#8211; Waterbase Pillow</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003J372NS/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mediflow &#8211; Waterbase Pillow</a> is almost indistinguishable from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AHDIHSC/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chiroflow &#8211; Water Pillow</a>. The only difference involves the material of the outer cover. Mediflow’s is made from 100-percent cotton as opposed to Chiroflow’s 65-percent polyester and 35-percent cotton.</p>
<p>Overall, we ranked the Chiroflow slightly higher than the Mediflow for its noticeably softer cover. Both pillows are the exact same design, involve the same customization set up and provide equally effective neck support.</p>
<h3>Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Kool-Flow</h3>
<p>We don’t recommend purchasing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PBFP0S6/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Kool-Flow</a> to avoid or alleviate neck pain. This pillow was too tall and stiff for comfortable neck support in any sleeping position. Instead, it placed the neck at an uncomfortable angle that resulted in all three of our testers abandoning it in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>We tried the queen size, though there are also king and standard size options.</p>
<p>Snuggle-Pedic is made from shredded polyurethane foam. Although it held its loft well, there was simply too much of it to sleep on comfortably and there is no zippered access to remove the excess. Beyond that, it felt lumpy and had a strong, unpleasant, chemical-like smell. The smell did not entirely dissipate even after airing out for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The micro-vented cover, made from bamboo viscose, polyester and lycra, was soft and breathable — but not removable. This is a plus for anyone who wants to avoid zippers, but a negative for anyone who wants the ability to wash the cover solo. You can opt to wash the entire pillow in cold water either by hand or via machine with minimum agitation, then squeeze out excess water and dry with high heat.</p>
<p>Although the product states you can gather and reshape the pillow to allow it to contour to your head and neck, we did not find this to be the case. No matter how we tried to reshape it, in the end it simply wasn’t comfortable.</p>
<p>While the company claims free customizations during an 120-day sleep trial (which may have helped by removing some of the excess foam), the fine print states this benefit will only apply if you purchase the product directly from Relief-Mart, Inc. The same goes for the offer of free return shipping and their 20-year warranty.</p>
<p>Even if you did purchase direct, who wants to deal with shipping their entire brand new pillow back to the manufacturer for customization? Not us.</p>
<h3>Brooklyn Bedding &#8211; Talalay Latex</h3>
<p>We were not fans of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ0AHRK/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brooklyn Bedding &#8211; Talalay Latex</a> for proper neck support, either. We tried the plush version, which does not hold its loft at all. It was similar to sleeping on a giant sponge that compresses under the weight of your head and then quickly springs back to its original shape when you get up. This didn’t do our necks any favors.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Bedding is molded from 100-percent latex rubber foam and has a soft, zippered, removable and breathable cover which is machine washable. The cover is very nice.</p>
<p>Perhaps this pillow might be a better option for stomach sleepers who are not concerned with neck pain. It also comes in a firm variety which may offer better cervical support than this one did.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Overall, we believe that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0S6LBD/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a> is the best pillow option on the market for anyone experiencing, or who wants to avoid, neck pain. The cross-cut, gel-infused memory foam and microfiber fill is comfortable, adjustable and — most importantly — provides the perfect cushion to cradle your neck. It is designed to align your head, neck and shoulders into a neutral position for a pain-free, restful night’s sleep.</p>
<p>We also slept well with our two runners-up: the Perform Pillow and the Nature&#8217;s Guest.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075312Y9Y/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perform Pillow &#8211; Memory Foam</a> was soft and welcoming, while supporting the neck in all the right places. The contoured memory foam can be used in one of four positions to adjust to different sizes and preferences. Because the pillow can’t be manipulated like the shredded memory foam of our winner, it might take users some adjustment to get used to it.</p>
<p>The fiber-filled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IWM6056/?tag=ybdneckpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nature&#8217;s Guest</a> also performed well in our product testing. This adjustable, firm and heavy microfiber pillow offered good neck support with its unusual contoured shape. Due to this unique design, we found this pillow especially beneficial for sleepers who frequently change positions during the night.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested the most popular sit-up pillows to find the one that gives you total back support while cushioning you in comfort. Hands down, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> is the best sit-up pillow for reading in bed, watching television, gaming or any other leisure activity.

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected sit-up pillows to test</h2>
<p>A sit-up pillow really has one purpose: give you back support while you’re reading or watching television in bed or on a couch. But after we read through Amazon consumer reviews, we learned that people also buy sit-up pillows to sit upright in bed after surgery or to help relieve chronic back pain.</p>
<p>The sit-up pillows we decided to test were recommended by reviewers for correcting posture while they were lounging to support back and neck muscles. But the pillows had to be comfortable, too; nobody enjoys sitting against a hard piece of foam.</p>
<p>We chose pillows that were stuffed with shredded memory foam, since it can be both firm and plush at the same time. People who buy a sit-up pillow for back pain often buy a bed wedge pillow, so we tested one of the most popular wedge pillows to see how it compared to traditional sit-up bed pillows</p>

<p>Many of the hundreds of models and styles of sit-up pillows look identical. During our testing we discovered that they’re not all alike. The following features of the best sit-up pillow will help you decide which one is right for you.</p>
<p><b>Size: </b>Most sit-up pillows have a similar shape: triangular with two armrests on each side. If you’re looking for a sit-up pillow that gives you both lower and upper back support, you’ll need one that is as tall as your entire back: The top of the pillow should reach your shoulders at the base of your neck. A shorter sit-up pillow will only support your lower back muscles, and you’ll feel the strain on your upper back muscles after a few minutes.</p>
<p>Two of the pillows we tested are available in several sizes. Before purchasing a sit-up pillow, we recommend measuring the length of your back and comparing it to the height of the pillow. We found that the extra-large size (24 inches) gives better back support to a tall person than the standard size (18 inches) does.</p>
<p><b>Long armrests: </b>Many sit-up pillows have short, stubby armrests that only reach as far as your elbows. Depending on the length of your arms, the short armrests may not even touch your elbows, which means you need to keep your arms elevated when you’re reading. Look for a sit-up pillow that has armrests that reach the base of your wrists. The extra length will support your elbows so you can hold a book and also cushion your arms when you’re watching television or just resting.</p>
<p><b>Materials: </b>All of the sit-up pillows we tested had a polyester cover, usually an ultra-suede or velour. Except for one of the pillows we tested, their covers can be removed and washed.</p>
<p>The best sit-up pillow is stuffed with shredded memory foam, which is often encased within its own separate cover. As we discussed in our reviews for the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-cooling-pillow/#important-features">best cooling pillow</a> and the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/#features">best pillow for side sleepers</a>, the memory foam should be CertiPUR-certified. <a href="https://certipur.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CertiPUR</a> tests polyurethane foams used in bedding for hazardous contaminants. Look for a label on the sit-up pillow that it’s been CertiPUR certified; otherwise, you could be breathing in toxic gases emitted from the foam.</p>
<h2 id="prepping">Prepping a sit-up pillow</h2>
<p>Many Amazon consumers are surprised that their sit-up pillow isn’t ready for immediate use when it’s delivered. Manufacturers compress the sit-up pillow, roll it and vacuum-seal it in plastic before shipping. When the pillow arrives, it needs to be released from the plastic, laid out flat and, as suggested by instructions, allowed to expand 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>We found, however, that the pillows fully expanded overnight. Although it’s not stated, we suspect that the 24-to-48-hour time period is to allow for off-gassing. Memory foam is notorious for its pungent chemical odor, which eventually dissipates. Since the majority of sit-up pillows are stuffed with memory foam, it’s best practice to let the pillow air out — we aired the test pillows on an outdoor patio — for two or three days.</p>
<h2 id="best">Best Sit-Up Pillow: Linenspa</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> was, by far, the most comfortable sit-up pillow we tested. Stuffed with shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, the Linenspa feels supportive and plush at the same time. Imagine your most comfy chair or sofa, and you’ll get a sense of what it’s like to settle into the Linenspa.</p>
<p>We tested the generously stuffed extra-large size, which gave full-back support while we sat in bed. The Linenspa has long (15 inches) and extra-wide (10 inches) armrests — the widest of all the pillows we tested — and they accommodated our forearms all the way to the palms of our hands.</p>
<p>The Linenspa is well made with strong stitching and thick fabric that’s been dyed a richly hued deep blue. (It’s also available in stone gray.) Unlike the other pillows we tested, the Linenspa doesn’t have a zipper for removing the cover. After testing, however, we decided that being able to remove the cover isn’t important, because once it’s been washed, the cover will shrink somewhat and be difficult to stuff the pillow back inside, especially into the armrests.</p>
<p>The Linenspa has a strong handle so we could easily drag it from the bedroom to the living room. We tested it on the couch, and it was slightly less comfortable, because its size takes up half the space of the sofa cushion. But once we shifted our position and sat more upright — as we were supposed to do — we never wanted to leave.</p>

Stuffed with CertiPUR-certified memory foam, we detected almost no unpleasant odors while using it.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=sitpil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Finally, we tried the Linenspa while sitting on the floor. Although the pillow does stay upright on its own, you do need to lean up against something if you want to use it for support. We did this same test with the other pillows, and we simply didn’t find any of them comfortable on the floor.</p>
<p>There was almost no off-gassing from this pillow, and although some Amazon reviewers complain about a heavy dye odor, we detected no strong smells from it.</p>
<p>The Linenspa is priced at $50, which is about average for a quality sit-up pillow. For $10 less, It’s also available in a smaller size, which is about one-third the size of the extra-large. For children and teens that size makes sense. The extra-large is quite heavy to lug around, so the standard size might also be better for the elderly who are bed-ridden.</p>
<p>Unlike the other pillows we tested, the Linenspa feels exceptionally durable. It supports upper and lower back and corrects posture while cushioning you in comfort.</p>
<p><b>Key takeways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Linenspa provides full support to upper and lower back and is also the most comfortable of the pillows we tested.</li>
<li>Its filling is made of shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, so it’s safe from hazardous contaminants.</li>
<li>The Linenspa’s armrests are extra-long and extra-wide, so you can rest the entire length of your arm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the standard size <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Milliard reading pillow</a> is too small for a tall person, it gives excellent support to middle- and lower-back muscles. It looks and feels like a floppy stuffed toy, so we were surprised at how firm the Milliard was when we propped it against the bed headboard and couch cushion. Although its dangling arms barely extended past our elbows, we gathered them to our sides and comfortably rested our arms on them.</p>
<p>The Milliard is stuffed with shredded CertiPUR-certified memory foam, and if you want a firmer pillow, Milliard will send additional filling upon request. It has a soft polyester velour cover, which can be removed for washing or spot-cleaning.</p>

<li>The Milliard may seem too soft and floppy, but it gives surprisingly good support to middle- and lower-back muscles.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s stuffed with CertiPUR-certified memory foam, so you can feel confident it won&#8217;t emit toxic gases.</li>
<li>The Milliard extra-large size is $10 more than the Linenspa, but it&#8217;s also an excellent option.</li>
</ul>

<h3>mittaGonG</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GJBW5ZM//tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mittaGonG reading pillow</a> gave good support to the lower back muscles, but because it’s only 20-inches high (the only size available) and not generously stuffed near the top, it can’t reach the upper back or neck. We found the mittaGong comfortable for watching television in bed, because we could lean back against the headboard. However, because of its short armrests, it was tiring to keep our elbows propped up to hold a book up for more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The mittaGonG seemed well made with a nice velour case and strong stitching. It’s stuffed with shredded memory foam, but it’s not CertiPUR-certified. Without the CertiPUR certification, you can’t trust what gasses might be emitted from the mittaGonG’s memory foam.</p>
<h3>Hit Notion &#8211; Husband Pillow</h3>
<p>Most reading pillows are known as “husband pillows,” apparently because they provide security, comfort and support. (Recently they’ve been renamed “boyfriend pillows.”) Hit Notion’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WLBH2T/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Husband Pillow</a> is one of the most popular on Amazon and is available in a rainbow of colors. It’s about the same size as the mittaGonG pillow, so it gives good lower-back support. A detachable neck roll is included, and it bolsters the neck but not the upper back.</p>
<p>The Husband Pillow’s armrests were splayed too far apart, so we could only rest our elbows and no other part of our arms comfortably. It’s a well-constructed pillow, and style-wise, we liked the two large buttons that connect the head roll to the top of the pillow. The Husband Pillow is also stuffed with shredded memory foam, and like the mittaGonG pillow, it’s not CertiPUR certified.</p>
<h3>X-tra Comfort Bed Wedge</h3>
<p>The bed wedge is popular with people who suffer chronic back pain, since its wedge shape promotes a completely upright posture and spine alignment. However, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U6HMK78//tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">X-tra Comfort</a> bed wedge is a misnomer, since it was the most uncomfortable of the pillows we tested. The bed wedge is designed solely for the bed; on the couch it was like leaning against a wood plank.</p>
<p>The X-tra Comfort wedge is made of two extra-stiff pieces of memory foam (not shredded, not CertiPUR), covered in a cheap-feeling velour case. The large wedge is intended for back support; the purpose for the smaller wedge is a mystery. The company’s website shows photos of placing the wedges under the model’s knees. We tried it, but elevating legs and feet as illustrated put strain on the lower back.</p>
<p>It’s also suggested that the wedge can be used as a sleeping pillow. Perhaps, if you enjoy sleeping on a rock. There are a number of bed wedges on the market, so pass this one by.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you love reading in bed, binging on Netflix or just lounging around on a lazy Sunday morning, you might be bolstering yourself up with extra pillows, which can strain your back muscles and neck.</p>
<p>We selected the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJFYB1/?tag=ybdsitpil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa</a> as the best sit-up pillow for providing full-back support and cushy comfort. Its extra-long and extra-wide armrests support your entire arm rather than just the elbow, and it’s the only pillow we tested that was so plush we never wanted to get up. The Linenspa is well made with quality fabric and strong stitching, and at $50 for the extra-large size you’re definitely getting your money’s worth.</p>
<p>We also liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0733ZCSR9/?tag=ybdsitpil" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Milliard</a> reading pillow, which feels soft and floppy but gives excellent support to the middle- and lower-back muscles. The standard size is too small for a tall person, and though its extra-large size is $10 more than the Linenspa, it&#8217;s also a great option for providing full back support in bed or on the couch.</p>

<p>Do you get frustrated when trying to fold a fitted sheet? You’re not alone.</p>
<p>Our team tried multiple methods recommended by professional organizers and through much deliberation, we found the best way to keep your linen closet looking organized, fitted sheets included, is to follow the folding technique we’ve outlined below.</p>
<p>All you need is your fitted sheet and a flat surface, such as your bed or a large table, to master the fold. To avoid wrinkles, we found that it’s best to fold your sheets as soon as you remove them from the dryer when they’re still warm.</p>
<p><BR></p>
<h1>Step-by-Step to Folding a Fitted Sheet</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>Turn the top corners inside out</strong>. With the shorter length of the fitted sheet parallel to your wingspan, flip the corners of the sheet outward.</li>

<BR></p>
<li><strong>Hold two corners of sheet with elastic band towards you</strong>. With the shorter length of the fitted sheet parallel to your wingspan, hold the top two corners of the sheet in your left and right hand with the elastic band facing you.</li>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sheets-clip2.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<BR></p>
<li><strong>Fold the sheet in half vertically, tucking the corners</strong>. Move your right hand to your left hand and fold the corners into each other to create one pocket.</li>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sheets-clip3.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<BR></p>
<li><strong>Fold the sheet in half horizontally</strong>. With both of the top corners in your left hand, use your free hand to hang the next corner closest to you over your right hand. Fold the right corner over the left corner, to create a new pocket over your right hand. The elastic band should be facing you. Fold the left over the right once more so all of the corners meet each other.</li>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sheets-clip4.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<BR></p>
<li><strong>Lay the fitted sheet on the bed and fold</strong>. With the elastic band facing upwards, fold the elastic edge inward lengthwise to make a symmetrical rectangle.</li>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sheets-clip5.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<BR></p>
<li><strong>Fold into a square</strong>. Fold the sheet into thirds until you have a flat rectangle.</li>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sheets-clip6.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
</ol>
<p>Now that you know how to fold a fitted sheet properly, you can keep your linen closet organized. We recommend that you slip the matching pillow cases into the corresponding folded fitted sheet to make it easier to determine the correct sets when you flip each room in your home.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our research by reading articles written by sleep experts at the National Sleep Foundation, Spine-Health.com and John Hopkins Medicine. Of the three general sleeping positions — supine (or back), stomach and side — sleeping on the right or left side is the most common.</p>
<p>Experts agree that although each position has both positives and negatives, it’s crucial to find the pillow that will provide the necessary support to your spine, neck, shoulders and head. Not all pillows are right for every sleeping position. Side sleepers need a pillow that elevates their head and cushions their neck and shoulders so their spine stays in alignment.</p>
<p>Finding the perfect pillow can be challenging since there are so many available. They come in different sizes and shapes and with a variety of fillings. There are thousands upon thousands of strongly held opinions about pillows, and from this commentary, we learned that pillow shopping is very personal; one pillow might be fluffy and comfortable for one side sleeper, and the same pillow might be hard as a rock for another side sleeper.</p>
<p>We selected a broad array of pillows that are recommended for and by side sleepers. Many pillows are marketed for people who sleep in any position, so we chose to test a few of those as well to determine whether they are actually suited for side sleepers.</p>

<h2 id="sleep-health">Sleep and health</h2>
<p>In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published their findings from a year-long study that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data_statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35 percent of American adults</a> over the age of 18 suffer from sleep deprivation. The CDC has not done another study since then, but other research indicates that that number has increased to 40 percent. If you’re one of the many millions of people who have lain awake at night, this probably comes as no surprise.</p>
<p>Sleep deprivation alters the normal functioning of the brain and weakens the immune system. The CDC and John Hopkins Medicine link insufficient sleep to chronic pain, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer, chronic heart disease, obesity and dementia.</p>
<h2 id="sleep-tips">Tips for better sleep</h2>
<p>Some of the causes of sleep deprivation are health related and require medical attention. John Hopkins Medicine and the <a href="http://sleepeducation.org/healthysleep/healthy-sleep-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Academy of Sleep Medicine</a> state that adults require at least seven hours of sleep each night and make the following recommendations for sleeping better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all technical devices, such as a television or computer.</li>
<li>Turn off your cell phone or tablet. Research shows that late-night use of a mobile device stimulates the brain.</li>
<li>If you use a night light, get one with a warmer or yellower color. The research we did on our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-night-light/">night light review</a> revealed blue lights make it harder to sleep.</li>
<li>Dim your digital alarm clock, or turn it away from your face.</li>
<li>Turn down the thermostat, and keep your bedroom cool.</li>
<li>Make sure your mattress is comfortable and supportive. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that a mattress should be changed every seven to 10 years.</li>
<li>Switch your sleeping position.</li>
</ul>

<p>Supine sleepers and stomach sleepers have different needs, because of the way their sleeping position aligns their necks and spines. A supine sleeper needs a pillow about 3- or 4-inches high with a firm center to support the head and neck, A stomach sleeper (only 8 percent of the population) needs a pillow with almost no height to keep the spine neutral and aligned. (Some stomach sleepers don’t use a pillow at all.)</p>
<p>Side sleeping is the most prevalent sleeping position and considered the healthiest way to sleep. Side sleeping aligns the curvature of the spine and is often prescribed for alleviating neck and back pain. It also diminishes snoring and sleep apnea by keeping nasal and throat passages open.</p>
<p>If you’re a side sleeper, you need a pillow that will make up the distance between your head and the mattress to keep your spine in a neutral position. This type of pillow can be an elongated capsule shape or curved to fit around your neck.</p>
<p>The side sleeper pillow is filled with a soft material that holds its shape and creates a thick “loft,” which is the pillow’s height when it lays flat on the mattress.</p>
<p>Pillows for side sleepers come in the usual standard, queen and king sizes. The size you choose will depend on your height, weight and width of shoulders. Most side sleepers prefer a larger pillow for maintaining head and neck support if they switch sides during the night.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Shredded memory foam filling</h3>
<p>Memory foam is composed primarily of polyurethane that’s blended with chemicals to create a dense, heavy substance that softens under body heat. It’s durable and provides excellent support when it’s used in a bed mattress. A downside to memory foam is that it retains body heat, which makes it uncomfortably hot in higher temperatures.</p>
<p>The filling of the majority of the pillows we tested were shredded memory foam. As we discussed in our reviews about <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-cooling-pillow/">cooling pillows</a> and <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-mattress-topper/">mattress toppers</a>, any foam used in the manufacture of the pillow should be certified by <a href="https://certipur.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CertiPUR-US</a>, a non-profit organization that rigorously tests polyurethane foams for ozone depleters, fire retardants, mercury, lead and other hazardous contaminants. If the filling is not CertiPUR-certified, you can’t be sure where and what the foam came from or if you will be breathing in toxic gas emitted from the foam.</p>
<p>Shredded memory foam has the same moldable characteristic, but the smaller pieces move independently and can be easily shaped. Shredded foam is ideal for a pillow because it will fit the contours of your neck and, unlike a down pillow, will keep your head aloft.</p>
<p>Not all shredded memory foam is alike. The manufacturers of all of the pillows we tested made claims of a “proprietary blend” of memory foam. Basically this means that they didn’t cut the foam from somebody’s tossed-out recliner. In fact, some consumers do complain that shredded memory foam feels chopped up inside the pillow case.</p>
<p>Only one pillow in our testing had memory foam that felt rough cut, the Snuggle-Pedic. Snuggle-Pedic’s website seems a bit defensive about it. They come clean that the memory foam for their pillows is leftover trimmings from their mattresses. But they also have a lengthy statement about the purity of the particular — and proprietary — foam they use.</p>
<h3>Gel fiber</h3>

<p>To add extra softness and flexibility to the memory foam, several manufacturers add gel fiber. Gel fiber is a synthetic fiber that has a silken feel to it and when blended with shredded memory foam, it softens the rough cut texture. Other benefits of gel-fiber-infused memory foam are that it’s hypoallergenic and adds a cooling element to the heat-trapping memory foam.</p>
<h3>Bamboo pillows</h3>
<p>A current trend for manufacturers is marketing their pillows as “bamboo,” which supposedly makes their pillows better than others. <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0122-bamboo-fabrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This is a case of false advertising.</a> The pillow padding itself is not made of bamboo, only the pillowcase is made of a bamboo-derived viscose rayon.</p>
<p>The viscose rayon is a breathable fabric with a velvety softness that’s similar to silk. Most of the pillows we tested were designed to be slept on without a traditional pillow case (one that matches your bed linens), so we preferred the bamboo pillows over those that had other polyester-blend or cotton pillowcases.</p>
<h3>Loft</h3>
<p>The amount of gel fiber blended with the memory foam will determine a pillow’s loft. For a side sleeper pillow, loft should be approximately 5 or 6-inches high. Less than that, and your head will sink into the pillow and put pressure on the curvature of your spine.</p>
<p>Factors that contribute to how well the pillow’s loft is maintained are the size of your head, your body’s weight and the breadth of your shoulders. Ideally you should be able to test a pillow for several nights to determine the efficacy of its loft.</p>
<p>Several pillows we tested had a blend of memory foam and gel fiber. But not all of them retained their loft after repeated nights. The best was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYU7V4S/?tag=ybdsspillw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a>. The loft of other test pillows had sagged somewhat (or entirely) by morning, but the Eden kept our testers’ heads supported and elevated.</p>
<h3>Adjustable filling included</h3>
<p>All of the pillows we tested were advertised as being adjustable, and that’s certainly true. Filling can be added or removed to raise or lower the pillow’s loft. However, only two of the pillows we tested — the Eden and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EINBSEW/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Dawn</a> — actually included extra filling in a separate bag. The other pillows had stuffing that could be removed to lower the loft but none that could be added to increase the loft.</p>
<p>One pillow, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078SW9YZD/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sweetnight &#8211; SN-P001-K</a>, included a nice cloth bag to store removed filling, but no additional filling for increasing loft was included. We checked the manufacturer and, similar to most of the other pillows, you can request extra filling, which they send free of charge.</p>
<h3>Separate pillowcase</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillowcase.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>One of the most important features is a separate removable pillow case that could be washed. You might think that this would be a standard feature, but it’s not. Almost all of the pillows advertised that their pillow cases had breathable, cooling fabric, and by and large, they did.</p>
<p>Naturally, over time, you will want to wash the pillowcase, and to do so, you&#8217;ll need to remove every last bit of stuffing, unless the manufacturer states that the entire pillow is washable.</p>
<p>If a storage bag wasn’t included with the pillow, then you’ll need a bag or receptacle nearby to catch the flyaway fluff. Once the pillow case is cleaned, you have to re-stuff and re-fluff the pillow in the dryer. In our minds, this is just too much work for any pillow.</p>
<p>Only three of the shredded foam pillows we tested had a separate pillowcase: the Eden, the Dawn and the Sweetnight. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073H7MNNB/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tuft &amp; Needle</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076MG5KTD/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coisum</a> also had separate pillowcases, but both are whole pieces of foam, which are easy to remove.</p>
<h3>Trial period</h3>
<p>During our research we discovered that pillows for side sleepers are a hot item. Naturally, every company that makes a shredded foam or gel fiber pillow wants to advertise that their product is the best one for side sleepers. So if you research buying pillows, you’ll see manufacturers making claims that their one pillow will magically put you to sleep no matter what your preferred sleeping position is.</p>
<p>The only true way of finding out whether or not a pillow is right for you is to try it out. Almost all pillow manufacturers allow you at least 30 nights; others increase the trial period to 60 nights. The best will offer 100 nights or even longer, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snuggle-Pedic-Ultra-Luxury-Combination-Adjustable-Hypoallergenic/dp/B072HFY7WZ/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic</a>.</p>
<p>A few of the pillows held their loft for the first two or three nights. But after that, their loft began to decrease and no longer provided the support they had on the first night. Several of the heavily hyped pillows went flat the instant we laid our heads down. If you spend $80 for a pillow, you want it to last for years. So take advantage of the longer trial period.</p>
<h2>How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pillow-fluffing.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<h3>First steps</h3>
<p>All of the pillows are compacted to fit into shipping boxes, so we had to first allow the pillows to expand naturally, anywhere between one and five minutes. Next, shredded foam is notorious for its rank chemical odor, so before sleeping on them, we allowed the pillows to air outdoors for at least two days.</p>
<p>Finally, as recommended by the pillow manufacturers, we tossed each pillow into a dryer and spun it for 10 minutes at low heat. This last process fluffs the pillow to its highest loft. This step is also recommended for refreshing and re-fluffing your pillow after several nights’ use.</p>
<h3>Adjusting the loft</h3>
<p>Side sleepers need a loft that lifts the neck to align with the spine while cushioning the head at the same time. Except for the Coisum and Tuft &amp; Needle, all of the pillows were advertised as adjustable, meaning filling could be added or removed to adjust the loft. (Tuft &amp; Needle will make an adjustment if you return the pillow to them.)</p>
<p>Many pillows also made claims that their pillows were stuffed with filling that most people find sufficient. This claim proved woefully inadequate in most cases, as the included filling was not enough to maintain a high loft.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, only the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B01LYU7V4S/?tag=ybdsspillw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eden</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EINBSEW/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dawn</a> provided a bag of extra filling in the box. Since all of the pillows stated that out of the box they were stuffed to full capacity, we stuffed both Coop pillows with the included extra stuffing. If the loft was too high, we could gradually remove stuffing until, like Goldilocks, we achieved just the right height.</p>
<p>It took us a lot of trial and error to finally get the right amount of stuffing for each tester. We were glad that there was enough filling included with the two Coop pillows so we could experiment at our leisure. Except for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XVMJMSH/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scrumptious</a>, none of the other pillows had sufficient filling. We appreciate that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snuggle-Pedic-Ultra-Luxury-Combination-Adjustable-Hypoallergenic/dp/B072HFY7WZ/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic</a> and <a href="https://www.nestbedding.com/products/the-easy-breather-pillow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nest Bedding</a> will send additional filling upon request, but we question why not just include it when the pillow is shipped?</p>
<h3>Sleeping</h3>
<p>Inevitably, it came down to sleeping on the pillows. Both of our testers change positions during the night; one is a back/side sleeper, the other a stomach/side sleeper. Each tester slept on a different pillow for a minimum of three nights and in the morning recorded responses to whether the pillow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Held its loft</li>
<li>Supported neck and head</li>
<li>Diminished neck, shoulder and back pain</li>
<li>Improved sleep</li>
</ul>

<p>After testing and retesting all of the pillows for three weeks, our testers agreed that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B01LYU7V4S/?tag=ybdsspillw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a> was the superior pillow for side sleepers. It has just the right amount of filling to bolster the neck and cushion the head and shoulders.</p>
<p>The Eden is Coop Home Good’s most recent addition to their product line, which includes their top-selling Dawn pillow, body pillow, traveler’s pillow and toddler’s pillow. The outer case is made of bamboo-viscose rayon and polyester with geometric stitching. It’s not cool-to-the-touch like a gel pillow, but the material never heats up because it’s so breathable. You can squeeze the pillow and almost feel it exhale.</p>
<p>The pillow case has a strong, stretchable gusseted edge that prevents the pillow from pinching together and promotes even distribution of the filling. The gel-infused shredded memory foam has its own zippered inner casing, so the pillow case can be slipped off without foam flying everywhere. The gel infusion gives the shredded foam an ultra-soft, feathery texture, yet it’s substantial enough to maintain a high loft all night long.</p>

Its cooling gel-infused memory foam fills the pillow edge to edge and never loses loft.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LYU7V4S/?tag=ybdsspillw-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our testers described the Eden as “comforting” and “cocoon-like.” There’s plenty of filling to stuff the queen-size pillow from corner to corner. The Eden is adjustable, but neither tester felt it was necessary to remove any filling. Other than Coop Home Good’s original Dawn pillow, this was the only pillow we tested that had the right amount of filling straight out of the box. Coop Home Goods will also send more filling upon request, but we honestly don’t think you’ll need extra.</p>
<p>Another plus for the Eden is that it did not have the characteristic memory foam odor and did not need as much time to air outdoors as the other pillows (excluding the Dawn). We fluffed it up in the dryer for 15 minutes and slept on it that night. The pillowcase had a pleasant, light vanilla scent, which eventually wore off, and the foam had no scent other than just smelling clean.</p>
<p>The Eden has both Certi-PUR certification and Greenguard Gold certification, which ensures that the pillow is safe for use in schools and healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>At $80, the Eden is comparable in price to other memory-foam pillows. Choosing a pillow is completely subjective, but Coop Home Goods offers a 100-night trial period and full refund, so it’s worth a try.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Eden is filled with the right amount of shredded memory foam to keep your head cushioned and neck and shoulders supported.</li>
<li>The unique gel-infused memory foam keeps the pillow cool and doesn’t have the usual chemical odor of memory foam.</li>
<li>The foam is stuffed into its own casing, so the pillow case can be easily removed and separately washed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our testers enjoyed the contouring shape of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XVMJMSH/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeydew Sleep Company’s Scrumptious</a>. This pillow, specifically designed for side sleepers, fits snugly around the neck and shoulders and bolsters the head on either side of its unusual arc.</p>
<p>Honeydew is a small, California-based company, and they have sourced two types of Certi-PUR certified memory foam that are unique to their product. This means that they’re not cutting off scraps from memory foam mattresses, as many pillow manufacturers do, but are actually making the shredded foam solely for their pillows.</p>
<p>Although the company claims that the Scrumptious is suitable for all sleepers, they really had the side sleeper in mind when designing it. There’s plenty of foam inside, so you don’t need to purchase additional foam from Honeydew. That said, they will provide it upon request. If you cut a doughnut in half, you’ll get an approximate idea of how the Scrumptious is shaped.</p>
<p>The curve fits snugly around your neck and shoulder and the “wings” on either end support your head and face. One of our testers said that it prevented him from shifting out of the side-sleeping position by squaring up his shoulders and keeping his spine in alignment. Another tester, however, claimed that the shape forced him to sleep on his back.</p>
<p>Out of the box, the Scrumptious’s velvety-soft viscose pillowcase had a pleasant aroma, but its memory foam interior had a slight chemical odor. We aired it outside overnight, and by morning the smell was mostly gone. Over the three-week testing period, Scrumptious still smelled fresh.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XVMJMSH/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/scrumptious-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Spine Alignment: Honeydew Sleep Company - Scrumptious</h3><p>The pillow’s crescent-moon shape squares up your shoulders and keeps your spine aligned through the night.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XVMJMSH/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Our biggest complaint with the Scrumptious is that the filling is stuffed directly into the pillow case and does not have its own separate, washable casing. To clean the pillow case, all of the stuffing must be removed and then the pillowcase re-stuffed once it’s been washed and dried. The company sells pillow cases for the entire pillow, but we wonder why they simply don’t redesign the pillow so the stuffing has its own casing.</p>
<p>One of our testers said he could sleep on the Scrumptious for the rest of his life. But at $100, it’s the most expensive of the pillows we tested. Honeydew Sleep has a 60-day trial period, which will give you the chance to decide if the Scrumptious is worth the price.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Scrumptious’s contoured shape curves around your neck and shoulders while supporting your head and face.</li>
<li>The pillow prevents a side sleeper from shifting position by keeping your spine aligned.</li>
<li>It doesn’t have a separate pillowcase, so the stuffing must be removed before washing the pillow case.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recommend">We also recommend</h2>
<h3>Coop Home Goods &#8211; Dawn</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EINBSEW/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Dawn</a> is Coop Home Good’s original memory foam pillow, and it has some of the features of the upgraded Eden pillow. There’s plenty of filling provided, so the Dawn has the same plush and supportive loft. The Dawn’s filling is enclosed in its own casing, so the velvety pillowcase can be easily removed and separately washed. The Dawn does not have the gusseted edging, so unlike the Eden, the filling doesn’t reach the corners of the pillow.</p>
<p>The filling is a mix of shredded memory foam and microfiber and doesn’t have the feathery texture of the Eden’s filling. It also has the slight chemical odor of memory foam that didn’t quite dissipate after outdoor airing for several days. Nevertheless, the Dawn was still one of our favorites.</p>
<h2 id="not-right">Not right for side sleepers</h2>
<h3>Nest Bedding &#8211; Easy Breather</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8WVD7M/ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Easy Breather</a> scored high in <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-cooling-pillow/">our testing of cooling pillows</a>, but our two side-sleepers agreed that although it’s nicely made, it was somewhat too soft and pliable to hold a supportive loft. The Easy Breather had a gusseted edge that evenly distributes the memory foam, which had a slight chemical odor. The lyocell pillowcase mostly covered the foam’s scent, but it wasn’t as soft to the touch as the Eden’s or Dawn’s pillowcases.</p>
<p>Like other adjustable pillows, filling can be removed, but a storage bag isn’t included. The Easy Breather does not have a separate casing for the filling, so it must be completely removed before you can wash the pillow. We found this to be too inconvenient for such a pricey pillow.</p>
<h3>Tuft &amp; Needle &#8211; PI003-S</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073H7MNNB/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tuft &amp; Needle’s premium pillow</a> is made of a single piece of their trademarked Adaptive Foam, which the company also uses for their mattresses. The Adaptive Foam is infused with gel and graphite that Tuft &amp; Needle claims keep the foam cool. The foam is punctured with tiny holes and sewn into its own casing and has a pleasant scent. Although this pillow is advertised as a pillow for side sleepers, it has little loft and did not elevate our testers’ necks. It’s another well-made pillow, but it’s better suited for back or stomach sleepers.</p>
<h3>Snuggle-Pedic</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072HFY7WZ/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic</a> is one of the companies that inaccurately markets their pillow as a bamboo pillow. In reality, it’s a shredded gel-infused memory foam pillow with a 40-percent bamboo viscose pillowcase. The foam is trimmed from the company’s mattresses, and although the gel adds a noticeable cooling and softening factor to the foam, the shredded bits feel coarse and chunky. The company takes great pains on its website to defend the purity of their foam, but unfortunately, even after three weeks, its odor hung on.</p>
<p>The pillow had a good loft, but the odor and rough-cut texture to the shredded foam disrupted our testers’ sleep.</p>
<h3>Sweetnight &#8211; SN-P001-K</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078SW9YZD/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sweetnight &#8211; SN-P001-K</a> had a couple of the features our testers preferred: a separate casing for the filling and a soft-to-the-touch pillowcase. The filling’s casing, however, could not mask the foam’s overwhelmingly acrid odor. Sweetnight’s shredded high-density memory foam had an odd texture. When squeezed, it squished into a clump, and so the pillow could not sustain a loft and went flat under the weight of each tester’s head.</p>
<h3>Infinitemoon &#8211; Everpillow</h3>
<p>Marketed as the “world’s most comfortable pillow,” <a href="https://infinitemoon.com/everpillow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infinitemoon</a> offers the option of selecting the filling for the Everpillow: latex noodle, kapok silk or a blend of both. We ordered the blend, which is 90 percent latex and 10 percent kapok silk. The pillow arrived in a vacuum-sealed bag, and when opened, the pillow expanded to its full length and resembled a giant dog biscuit.</p>
<p>The latex-kapok filling had a pleasant, lemony scent and was soft to the touch. We can’t criticize the pillow’s cuddly texture, but it had no loft. The pillow seemed too long and narrow for the amount of filling included. Infinitemoon will send a pound of extra filling upon request (within 18 months of purchase), which might plump the pillow to the height a side sleeper needs.</p>
<h3>Coisum &#8211; 4332456308</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076MG5KTD/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coisum &#8211; 4332456308</a> is an orthopedic memory foam pillow designed for alleviating neck and back pain. Its unique butterfly shape is curved for placement of the neck and arms. The pillow is a single piece of memory foam, similar to a Tempur-Pedic, and does not have the cooling properties of the other pillows we tested. Although it’s marketed as a pillow for side sleepers, the Coisum had no loft, and the memory foam was too hard and uncomfortable for both testers.</p>
<h3>Sable &#8211; SA-BD013</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074Q8C7BY/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sable &#8211; SA-BD013</a> is a goose-down-alternative pillow that’s stuffed with hypoallergenic polyester fiber fill. It has a 100-percent cotton pillowcase, which is soft and cool to the touch. Sable markets the pillows as adjustable, which is accurate, since the puffy stuffing can be removed. The stuffing was this pillow’s downfall. Both testers complained that the pillow had no shape or substance, and even folded over two or three times, the pillow gave no support.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Many pillows are marketed as the best for side sleepers, and we discovered from our testing that those claims just aren’t accurate. What works for a stomach sleeper or back sleeper simply doesn’t work for a side sleeper. If you’re a side sleeper you need a pillow that fills in the gap between the mattress and your head and keeps your spine aligned.</p>
<p>Over a three-week period, our testers slept on 10 different pillows, and agreed that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B01LYU7V4S/?tag=ybdsspillw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coop Home Goods &#8211; Eden</a> pillow met their needs for support and comfort. The Eden’s cooling gel-infused shredded memory foam bolsters the neck and cushions the head and shoulders. The Eden is filled with more than enough stuffing to keep the pillow’s loft high or low depending on your preference. It’s priced at $80, which might seem steep, but Coop Home Goods offers a 100-night trial period and full refund if you’re not satisfied.</p>
<p>Our runner up is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XVMJMSH/?tag=ybdsspllw-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeydew Sleep Company’s &#8211; Scrumptious</a>, a pillow that was specifically designed for side sleepers. Its unusual crescent shape fits snugly around the curvature of the neck and prevents a side sleeper from shifting positions during the night.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To narrow down our list of contenders, we researched the different types of mattress toppers and delved into which features would be the most important to consider when choosing a mattress topper. Then we conferred with industry experts about how a mattress topper can aid sleep. Once we had a good understanding of the market and what to look for, we narrowed down our finalists to those that were highly praised by online reviewers.</p>
<p>We considered several types of mattress toppers: gel-infused memory foam, latex and feather fill (down alternative). We steered away from down feather and wool mattress toppers due to low consumer interest. Plus, while true feather allergies are rare, they do exist. This was another reason to skip testing down altogether.</p>
<p>We spoke with Bill Fish, co-founder of Tuck.com and a certified sleep science coach. An entrepreneur for over 15 years, Bill became fascinated with the health aspects of sleep in 2014. Bill has designed and constructed mattresses for sale online, and in doing so, he has gained an understanding of the needs of consumers from the viewpoint of both seller and buyer.</p>
<p>We also consulted with Brian Wilson, founder and president of <a href="http://catalystptandwellness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catalyst Physical Therapy and Wellness</a> to discuss proper sleep positioning as it relates to choosing a mattress topper. As he notes: “From an orthopedic standpoint, a person’s ideal sleeping posture should preserve the natural curvatures of the spine. Choosing a mattress must factor in the position they tend to sleep in and any underlying conditions that affect their spine.”</p>
<p>Brian holds a master’s degree in Physical Therapy from Rockhurst University and has 12 years of professional experience as a physical therapist. In addition to owning his own practice, Brian has taught at Point Loma Nazarene University in the Masters of Kinesiology program.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a mattress topper?</h2>
<p>We asked our sleep specialist, Bill Fish, who would benefit from a mattress topper. He said that “if you want to revitalize a mattress that hasn’t reached its lifespan, you may be able to do so at a fraction of the cost by adding a mattress topper. Typically a mattress topper is utilized to soften the present mattress or to add a cooling feature.”</p>
<p>It’s important to note that if your mattress has become unsupportive, meaning that your spine is not in proper alignment while you sleep, you would be better off spending your money on a new mattress rather than trying to improve an old one with a mattress topper. The <a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/bedroom/touch.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Sleep Foundation</a> recommends replacing your mattress every seven to 10 years.</p>
<p>Another instance where a mattress topper can benefit you is in adjusting the comfort of a new mattress. <a href="https://www.rti.org/sites/default/files/resources/rr-0016-1108-hogan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research shows</a> that it is difficult to predict your optimal mattress from a “test drive” in a showroom. If you bought a mattress that is too firm, for instance, a mattress topper can cushion your joints and help you sleep better.</p>
<h3>The difference between a mattress topper and mattress pad</h3>
<p>While the terms mattress topper and mattress pad are sometimes used interchangeably by consumers and retailers, there are important differences between the two. Mattress pads keep contaminants such as dust mites and bacteria off your sleep surface. They protect your mattress rather than enhance your comfort level while sleeping. On the other hand, a mattress topper can provide additional support and improve the softness and comfort of a mattress. Toppers do little to inhibit contaminants or provide protection against stains.</p>
<h3>Mattress topper for back pain</h3>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to choosing a mattress topper to alleviate back pain. However, most individuals benefit from maintaining a neutral spine (or as close to this as possible) during sleep.</p>
<p>An appropriate mattress topper makes sleeping in proper positions easier and more comfortable. Your sleeping surface and a correct posture should alleviate pressure at the hips, shoulders and other bony areas. This results in less stress on the back, less pain and a more restful night’s sleep.</p>
<p>Ashley Little from <a href="https://www.mattressadvisor.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mattress Advisor</a> summarizes, “Medium-firm to firm memory foam material toppers are the best for preventing back pain — specifically memory foam because of its ability to evenly distribute your body weight.” Latex also conforms closely to the sleeper’s body, which can strike the right balance between improved spinal alignment and pressure relief. The right mix of firm support and comfortable feel will be determined by your own personal preferences.</p>
<p>Wilson outlines some considerations for choosing a mattress topper based on the position in which you sleep:</p>
<p><b>Lying on your back (supine position): </b>This position is often recommended because your weight is distributed throughout the largest possible surface area. This prevents areas of increased pressure and helps maintain a neutral spine (with a few modifications). Too soft of a mattress can be detrimental in the supine sleeper as the pelvis may roll backward. This causes a flattening of the lumbar curve and forces more pressure across the anterior portion of the intervertebral discs. A firm to medium-firm mattress topper and a pillow placed under the knees helps maintain a neutral spine.</p>
<p><b>Lying on your stomach (prone position): </b>This position is generally considered to be hard on both the low back and the neck. Both may be overarched, while the neck is also rotated or twisted to one side. These issues can be minimized with effective positioning. A pillow placed under the hips helps alleviate stress on the low back while sleeping without a pillow at the head/neck reduces extension there.</p>
<p><b>Lying on your side: </b>Lying in this position can be great for many people, but often takes some adjustments in order to properly align the spine. A few extra pillows often solve this problem. A pillow between the legs allows one leg to rest on top of the other without tilting the hips, rotating the spine or causing discomfort as the knees rest on one another. A second pillow hugged at the chest prevents rolling forward. Together these adjustments help prevent spinal rotation and allow for a more neutral spine position with less stress throughout the back.</p>
<p>Leslie Fisher, founder of <a href="http://sustainableslumber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sustainable Slumber</a>, adds: “If you sleep on your side, your shoulder and hip bone jut out. Those parts of your body should sink into the topper, keeping your spine aligned. Therefore, a side sleeper is going to need a very plush topper.”</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Firmness:</b> In the mattress industry, <a href="https://www.thesleepjudge.com/understanding-indentation-load-deflection-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firmness is measured</a> by Indentation Load Deflection (ILD). The ILD is measured by compressing a foam sample to 25 percent of its original height. The amount of force (in pounds) required to indent the foam is its 25-percent ILD measurement. The more force required, the firmer the foam. A mattress topper having an ILD of 12 would be very soft, while an ILD of 50 would be very firm.</p>
<p><b>Density:</b> The quality of density is a verifiable, scientific measurement. It is a measurement of the mass per unit volume. A soft latex has a density of two pounds, while a very firm latex would measure at six pounds.</p>
<p>Drew Kalinksi, E-commerce manager at <a href="http://www.ayercomfort.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ayer Comfort</a>, reports that: “Density in memory foam tells you how much you will sink into the foam and the quality of it. Memory foam gets more expensive depending on the density of the foam. Most memory foam mattress toppers will range from 2 to 6 pounds in density; 3 pounds is a common density due to the fact it is suitable for most people.”</p>
<p>A softer density can give you pressure relief and help ease joint stiffness, while a firmer density helps give stable support for the spine. Read on for a quick rundown of the main densities in memory foam, according to Kalinski, to help you make a better purchase decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3 pounds per cubic feet or less:</strong> Your body will sink into the topper a little more than it would with higher-density memory foam. This density is recommended for anyone under 200 pounds. It offers enough support and comfort for most people and is one of the most common densities.</li>
<li><strong>4 to 5 pounds per cubic feet:</strong> This density is a good balance between soft and supportive. It will mold to your body a little more slowly than lower densities. But, it’s perfect for people who are over 200 pounds, and it’s also great for couples.</li>
<li><strong>6 pounds per cubic feet or more:</strong> Most people won’t require this level of firmness unless they have medical needs. This is a rarer and more expensive foam, with a density so firm that it is often used as a base in mattresses.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Recovery time:</b> The most famous feature of memory foam, one that earned it its moniker, is its ability to mold to the shape of your body and then return to its original shape. Some foams bounce back more quickly than others. The pressure and weight applied by your body will leave an indentation in a memory foam mattress topper — how long it takes to bounce back varies from seconds to minutes.</p>
<p>When you move into a new position (the average person changes sleeping positions a dozen times per night), you don’t want to be left unsupported by a deep indentation. A thicker high-density topper will take longer to bounce back. In our testing, the memory foam toppers with a faster recovery were springier and more comfortable to sleep on.</p>
<p><b>Cooling: </b>Latex mattress toppers tend to run cooler than memory foam, although gel-infused mattresses have greater air flow and a cooling component<b>. </b>Down alternative toppers have a tendency to run hot.</p>
<p><b>Motion isolation:</b> Memory foam and latex tend to absorb motion and isolate it to certain areas of the mattress, which could be important if you have a partner that tosses and turns during the night. Conversely, feather fill mattress toppers do not offer this benefit to any noticeable degree.</p>
<p><b>Durability:</b> With some mattress toppers costing upwards of $100, it should be expected that your topper will have a long life span. Latex and memory foam toppers tend to be more durable, while down alternative toppers have a shorter lifespan.</p>
<p><b>Machine washable:</b> Mattress toppers are rarely machine washable, and spot cleaning may put unnecessary wear and tear on them. Toppers with machine washable covers can make your investment last longer, which is especially important if you’re purchasing an expensive topper.</p>
<p><b>Green certifications: </b>Assurance that your mattress topper is free from harmful chemicals can help you sleep better at night. The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the worldwide leading textile processing standard for organic fibers and you can be confident that any GOTS-certified products meet their rigorous standards.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS) is highly regarded in the sleep industry. A product must contain more than 95-percent certified organic raw material to achieve GOLS certification.</p>
<p>You can limit your exposure to chemicals by finding one containing foam certified by CertiPUR-US, which independently tests and verifies which foams are made without harmful chemicals.</p>
<h2 id="different-types">Different types of mattress toppers</h2>
<p>E-commerce manager Drew Kalinski and sleep specialist Bill Tuck gave us insight into the pros and cons of the various types of mattress toppers we tested.</p>
<h3>Memory foam</h3>
<p>Memory foam is one of the most popular materials for both mattresses and mattress toppers these days. A high-end memory foam mattress can be very expensive, so a topper is a good way to get the benefits of memory foam without breaking the bank.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Memory foam conforms to your body, giving support and comfort.</li>
<li>It’s supportive if you have joint, muscular or back pain.</li>
<li>It reduces how much the noise and movement of a restless partner disturb your sleep.</li>
<li>It comes in a range of densities.</li>
<li>Durable memory foam can last for years (depending on the quality of the foam).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It can have a strong chemical smell, but this should dissipate after a few days.</li>
<li>It can hold heat, so make sure to find one that is open cell or has a cooling feature (such as gel-infused memory foam).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Latex</h3>
<p>Latex mattress toppers are generally the most expensive option but they provide excellent support and comfort. Latex is made from the rubber tree (hevea brasiliensis). The sap is collected and processed into latex, using one of two different processes: Dunlop or Talalay.</p>
<p><b>Dunlop latex:</b> The normal measurement for Dunlop latex is density and it is a firmer foam. Dunlop latex can be either natural or synthetic.</p>
<p><b>Talalay latex:</b> The normal unit for measuring Talalay latex is ILD and it is a softer foam. To achieve this, the latex is blended with synthetics and air is added. There is no such thing as 100-percent natural Talalay.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It provides comfort and pain relief by making your sleep surface firmer or softer.</li>
<li>Latex is springier, bouncier and firmer than memory foam.</li>
<li>It is antimicrobial and hypoallergenic unless you have a latex allergy.</li>
<li>Latex is very durable.</li>
<li>It is excellent at preventing motion transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Latex tends to be more expensive than other mattress toppers.</li>
<li>It is not recommended for anyone with a latex allergy; prolonged exposure to latex can lead to the development of a latex allergy. The amount of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-113/default.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latex exposure needed to produce sensitization</a> or an allergic reaction is unknown. Exposure to synthetic latex does not cause the symptoms of latex allergy.</li>
<li>It can get hot, especially in the summer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Down alternative</h3>
<p>A down alternative topper is a good option for those who put a strong emphasis on value, as it can improve the comfort of most sleep surfaces at a lower price point than most memory foam or latex mattress toppers. Down alternative toppers also have no or minimal odor, even when first unboxed, so they’re a great choice for those sensitive to smell.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Down alternative tends to be the most affordable option.</li>
<li>It is hypoallergenic and generally will not cause allergies to flare up.</li>
<li>It can provide decent to good support and pressure relief.</li>
<li>Down alternative toppers often weigh less than latex or memory foam toppers, so they are easier to move.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Below-average durability: it can become flat or misshapen after only a short time.</li>
<li>If you share a mattress, the poor motion isolation could be an issue.</li>
<li>Typically, down alternative toppers run hotter than latex or memory foam.</li>
<li>Down alternative toppers have limited thickness and are generally limited to two inches or less.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We put our finalists through a range of tests, both quantitative and qualitative, do determine the standout winners.</p>
<h3>TEST RESULTS</h3>
[table id=210 /]
<h3>Recovery time test</h3>
<p>We tested our memory foam toppers for recovery time to see how well they absorb compression forces and therefore aid with pressure relief. To determine how long each topper took to return to its original shape after being weighed down, we set a five-pound dumbbell in the middle of each mattress for an hour (similar to the amount of time between changing sleep positions). Then we removed the weight and used a stopwatch to determine the number of seconds or minutes it took to return to the original shape.</p>
<p>The HOFISH sprung back to shape in a matter of seconds, while the Linenspa took nearly a full minute. A difference of 35 seconds seems small, but the HOFISH was noticeably more comfortable to sleep on than the Linenspa and the numbers were in line with our overall opinion and ratings of these toppers.</p>
<h3>Overnight test</h3>
<p>Since a good night’s sleep is a ringing endorsement of a mattress topper, we slept on each mattress topper for several consecutive nights. We used two testers: one under 160 pounds (at which point firmer support is recommended) and one over 160 pounds. This variation was helpful to rate the perceived firmness of each topper, as well as to evaluate the toppers for motion isolation.</p>
<p>As the CEO and founder of Spine-health, Stephanie Burke, points out, “There is a difference between firm support and firm feel.” Looking at the density or ILD of a mattress topper can tell you how supportive it is, but not how firm it feels. Our two testers rated each topper on a scale of one to five, with five being the most firm. When evaluating, they considered whether the topper seemed to cushion joints or provide better spine support.</p>
<p>Despite weight differences, our testers agreed on the firmness and softness of our finalists. While we chose a medium-firm level for these two latex toppers, the Organic Textiles and Dreamfoam Bedding felt the most supportive of the toppers we tested. The HOFISH, Sleep On Latex and The Duck And Goose Co balance firmness and softness, although they may not have enough spine support for someone with back issues.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for more joint cushioning, the ViscoSoft &#8211; 4-Inch Memory Foam or Cheer Collection &#8211; Luxury Down Alternative were rated softest.</p>
<p>Our testers used a similar scale to rate each topper for temperature neutrality, judging whether each topper felt cool or retained heat. The Organic Textiles latex could heat up surprisingly quickly at night, so this is something to keep in mind if you tend to run hot or live in a warm climate. It was the most noticeably warm of the toppers we tested, alongside the Cheer Collection.</p>
<p>Memory foam by itself tends to retain heat, but the gel-infused HOFISH and ViscoSoft were our coolest mattress toppers. If staying cool helps you sleep better, you may also want to add a <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-cooling-pillow/" rel="noopener">cooling pillow</a> to your <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-sleep-mask/">sleeping sanctuary</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, our testers evaluated each topper on how much you can feel movement when a partner moves and whether their tossing and turning would keep you up at night. Once again, our memory foam toppers were the top contenders here, especially the HOFISH and Linenspa. The pillow top cover of the ViscoSoft lowered its rating and for similar reasons, the down alternative toppers were low on our list.</p>
<h3>Aesthetics and usability</h3>
<p>Although perhaps less important than comfort and support, function and design are also important considerations when choosing a mattress topper. When testing our mattress toppers, we kept aesthetics and usability in mind as well. We evaluated our toppers for visual design, noting how they looked and fit after putting on a fitted sheet.</p>
<p>We checked to see how well each topper fit on the bed (since toppers are slightly smaller than mattresses) and sat on the edge of the bed to check for edge support around the perimeter. While each of the toppers provided support for the full surface of the mattress, some of the more plush toppers such as the Sleep On Latex and ViscoSoft tended to be wobbly near the edge.</p>
<p>We considered slippage, noting whether or not a topper slips from the mattress when tossing and turning. While a regular fitted sheet worked fine for the down alternative toppers, you may want to size up to a deep pocket fitted sheet for use with thicker memory foam or latex topper, especially the 4-inch ViscoSoft. The fitted sheet would ride up after a night’s sleep on each of our memory foam and latex toppers, despite seeming to fit well when not in use.</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>While we didn’t conduct a durability test per se, the process of moving, testing and storing the toppers when not in use put some strain on them. The latex and down alternative toppers held up well, but the memory foam toppers suffered some rips and tears. Of the memory foam toppers, the HOFISH was the most durable. The Linenspa, being thinner than its counterparts, tore all the way through in areas and was relatively flimsy.</p>
<p>Our experience is likely not indicative of normal wear and tear since our testing process stretched the toppers to their limits and typically people keep a mattress topper confined to one bed. However, we verified through consumer reviews that the Linenspa does, in fact, tear easily.</p>

<h3>Off-gassing test</h3>
<p>What is off-gassing and do you need to worry about it? <a href="https://www.amerisleep.com/memory-foam-mattress-off-gassing-temporary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Off-gassing</a> is a reaction caused when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a memory foam topper break apart and commonly form gases. The majority of VOCs are released in the first hour (after opening the box) but can continue to release for an unknown period of time. Some people are sensitive to VOCs and can experience irritation of the eyes, nose or throat.</p>
<p>No studies show long-term effects of using memory foam, but this may be because tracking its long-term effects is virtually impossible. Heather Stapleton, an environmental chemist at Duke University, says there’s simply not enough data to determine whether low levels of these chemicals will eventually make people sick. If you’re concerned, organic latex may be a better option for you.</p>
<p>While some in the industry recommend unboxing a mattress or topper outside and letting it breathe for at least two days, we didn’t want to expose our toppers to the elements, so we kept them in a well-ventilated room next to a window.</p>
<p>Since off-gassing can be particularly unpleasant, we rated our toppers for odor straight out of the package. Immediately after unpackaging, we used a scale of one to five (five being the most unpleasant odor) to see which toppers may not be good for those sensitive to smell. We let each topper air out for 48 hours and then rated them a second time.</p>
<p>The good news is that any lingering smell dissipated within a week for all the memory foam toppers we tested, and the HOFISH and ViscoSoft were not overly pungent even fresh from the package.</p>

<p>We liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072FQKJFN/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HOFISH &#8211; Gel Infused Memory Foam</a> for being a topper that is best for a couple since its medium-firm support and the right amount of cushion offers a comfortable middle ground for most people. The feature we liked most about the HOFISH was its springiness, which made it feel more like latex than memory foam. However, it is gel-infused so it doesn’t run hot the way latex and typical memory foam does.</p>
<p>It’s also excellent at motion isolation, meaning you won’t wake up every time your partner rolls over. It’s especially a good choice for couples because of its ability to absorb motion and because it strikes the right balance between soft and supportive.</p>
<p>That said, it may not work if either one of the pair has back pain or is a back/stomach sleeper. It is a low-density foam, meaning it is more soft than supportive. While we felt it had a good balance for most people, side sleepers may appreciate this topper more than others.</p>

    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hofish.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The topper arrives compressed in a box so it looks thin and uneven when you first remove the shrink wrap plastic. Don’t let the first impressions fool you: it was in its full shape after a few hours.</p>
<p>The topper is environmentally safe and CertiPUR-US certified, so there are no dangerous chemicals and fewer worries about off-gassing. This was notable when we first opened the package, as it had less odor than other memory foam finalists. The smell also seemed to dissipate more quickly.</p>
<p>At 15 pounds, it is a medium weight compared to our other memory foam toppers and easy for one person to position on the bed. The foam has a slightly sticky feeling so it didn’t shift on the bed, but did need a fitted sheet in order to feel comfortable.</p>

<p>It lined up well with our queen size bed and it was easy to fit with a sheet. However, the fitted sheet rolled off our mattress and fitted onto the topper itself after a night’s sleep. It isn’t an issue for sleep, but isn’t as aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Both our testers commented on the coolness and motion isolation of this topper, which are its best features after the obvious benefit of adding softness to a current mattress. After several months of testing, it held up better than our other memory foam finalists, but it still had the drawback of small tears (mostly caused by transportation).</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The HOFISH &#8211; Gel Infused Memory Foam is great for side sleepers, as it responds to the shape of your body and takes the pressure off your hips and shoulders.</li>
<li>The memory foam is infused with gel and its open cell construction makes it more breathable, so it is great for hot sleepers or those in warm climates.</li>
<li>All the foam in the topper is CertiPUR-US certified, so you can worry less about emissions and more about getting a great night of sleep.</li>
<li>At less than$100 (upon publishing), it has great value and held up better to testing than our other memory foam finalists.</li>

<p>If you need a more supportive surface, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZZPF8O/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Organic Textiles &#8211; Organic Latex Topper</a>. It has firmer support than the majority of toppers we tested, and just enough cushion. The Organic Textiles is excellent for those with back pain, as it is firm enough to assist in achieving a neutral spine while providing enough cushion for the tailbone and shoulders.</p>
<p>The latex is made with the Dunlop process, so it is dense, durable and able to retain its elasticity. The Organic Textiles is Global Organic Latex Standard certified and is free from harmful chemicals and fillers. It has a higher-than-average price point, but it wasn’t the most expensive latex topper we tested. Due to the longevity of latex and the quality of the product, we felt it was worth the price.</p>
<p>In our months of testing, the Organic Textiles held up well to multiple nights of use and storage/transportation. This is partly thanks to the cover, which kept it clean and made it easier to move and position. At 34 pounds, the topper isn’t easy to move around but we were still able to unbox and position it without a second pair of hands.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >

<p>Like our memory foam finalist, it arrived vacuum sealed in plastic within a box. The Organic Textiles took on its correct shape almost immediately. It was amazing to watch it fill out in a matter of minutes, without leaving behind any ripples or wrinkles. After we placed it on the bed, it lay flat against the mattress with no gaps.</p>
<p>The square edges met up perfectly with our queen size bed, so once we fitted it with a sheet, it had a uniform look. The sheet didn’t stay overnight, but rolled up under the topper, as it did with our other latex and memory foam finalists. The cover has an embossed flower pattern, and while it didn’t show through our fitted sheet, one tester mentioned that it feels almost quilted.</p>

<p>As a dense topper, it does tend to heat up while sleeping despite a porous surface designed for more air flow. If you run hot, this may not be the best choice for you. Our testers noted that on warm nights, it could get a bit sweaty in the middle of the night and the buttery smell of the latex is stronger.</p>
<p>The mattress topper we tested is medium-density, with an ILD of 26-28. You can also tailor your topper by choosing soft (22-24 ILD) or firm (38-40 ILD) when you order through the company’s website. When you purchase through Amazon, it comes with a removable organic cotton cover, which is machine washable in cold water. On the company website, the toppers cost an additional $99.00.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Dunlop latex makes the Organic Textiles &#8211; Organic Latex Topper a dense and firm topper, so it is excellent for those with back pain who need to maintain a neutral spine.</li>
<li>It provides just enough cushion for joints, but it may be too firm for a side sleeper.</li>
<li>It is GOLS-certified, so it is free from chemical additives and made from all-natural components.</li>
<li>As a dense and durable topper with a washable organic cotton cover, this topper should have enough longevity to justify the higher price point.</li>

<p>While <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07547DNWG/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Duck And Goose Co &#8211; Down Alternative</a> (and fiber toppers in general) doesn’t offer as much support as foam or latex toppers, it also does not sink too deeply or conform too closely. This makes it ideal for sleepers of any position, and also for couples who may have different weights and needs. While it can accommodate back, stomach and side sleepers, it is better for adding softness to a too-firm mattress than adding additional support.</p>
<p>Of the down alternative toppers we tested, The Duck And Goose Co was the plushest, temperature-neutral and comfortable. It is filled with 1400 GSM (grams per square meter) microfiber. A higher GSM (above 600) means the filling is denser, making the topper thicker, fluffier and more comfortable.</p>
<p>It arrived in a plastic storage bag, similar to a comforter, and is lightweight and easy to position. Anchor bands help it stay in place and it didn’t move around on us during testing. Because it is lightweight and the bag is so convenient, we were able to remove it each morning and store it in the bag during the day. This kind of flexibility and ease of use was unique to The Duck and Goose Co topper.</p>

Since sleepers of any position will find this topper comfortable, it is a great option for couples with different sleeping positions.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07547DNWG/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>It has a baffle box construction, so the fill doesn’t shift and become lumpy during use or after it’s washed. Unlike its competitors that we tested, the boxes aren’t bulbous but rather filled uniformly. This gave it a thicker construction and more support overall than other down alternative toppers.</p>
<p>Due to the baffle box construction and round edges, it doesn’t look as uniform when fitted with a sheet; it looks like you have a pillow top on your mattress. On the other hand, the same reasons mean that our fitted sheet stayed in place after a night of sleep, unlike the memory foam and latex finalists.</p>
<p>As a down alternative topper, The Duck And Goose Co is hypoallergenic and acts as a barrier against dust and mites. While these toppers tend to sleep hot, the channel-weave construction of The Duck and Goose Co makes it breathable and therefore cooler than its counterparts.</p>
<p>While machine washing a down alternative topper can sometimes cause it to wear out early, The Duck And Goose Co is backed by a ten-year warranty — you can clean it to your heart’s content (which helps keep it hygienic).</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Duck And Goose Co &#8211; Down Alternative offers more softness than support, but can still be used by back and stomach sleepers as it doesn’t conform too closely.</li>
<li>With a heavyweight of fill, this topper is more dense, plush and comfortable than other down alternative toppers.</li>
<li>While similar toppers can heat up quickly, The Duck And Goose Co is breathable and temperature-neutral.</li>
<li>It is easy to care for and covered by a ten-year warranty, so you don’t have to worry about it breaking down in the washing machine.</li>

<p>We strongly considered naming the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075MQTB3W/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ViscoSoft &#8211; 4-Inch Memory Foam</a> as our luxury upgrade pick because it has so many nice features, but it offers very little in the way of support. The combination of low-density foam with a pillow top cover makes this topper sumptuously soft. If you’re a side sleeper and you’re looking to cushion your shoulders, hips and other joints, this would be a good option. Those who sleep on their backs or stomachs may want to steer away from the ViscoSoft.</p>
<p>If softness is your aim, then you will appreciate the 300-thread count sateen cotton cover, fluffy down alternative filling and gel-infused memory foam. With four inches total of padding added to your mattress, your joints have never been more cushioned. You can also sleep comfortably knowing the foam is CertiPUR-US and you don’t have to worry about off-gassing.</p>
<h3>Sleep On Latex &#8211; Pure Green Natural Latex</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UYGA49M/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep On Latex &#8211; Pure Green Natural Latex</a> is another topper that is ideal for side sleepers since it cushions joints such as hips and shoulders that may otherwise feel too much pressure. It would likely not be a good choice for a back or stomach sleeper since you sink so deeply into the topper. They do offer medium and firm versions of the product, although we didn’t test these.</p>
<p>This is a very heavy topper, weighing in at 34 pounds, and the combination of holes and weight can make it difficult to maneuver. However, the holes added enough airflow to make this topper cooler at night than other latex toppers.</p>
<p>It is made with the Dunlop process, meaning it is dense while still springy. This particular topper was bouncier than our other Dunlop latex topper and did not do a great job at absorbing and isolating movement. Overall, it offered a cloud-like sleeping experience that side sleepers would appreciate.</p>
<h3>Dreamfoam Bedding &#8211; Ultimate Dreams Talalay</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EK0FJDY/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dreamfoam Bedding &#8211; Ultimate Dreams Talalay</a> is made with Talalay latex, which is distinguished by a lighter, more breathable and supple consistency. With a 28 ILD, it is softer and more cushiony than our top pick for latex, but still firm enough for back and stomach sleepers.</p>
<p>While the feel of the topper is soft, supportive and accommodating to any sleep position, it pulled upward and away from the mattress at the edges. It also slid off the mattress after a few consecutive nights of sleep. For this reason, we decided not to name it our top pick.</p>
<p>It comes with a machine washable cover, so while it is the most expensive topper we tested, your investment is protected against stains, wear and tear.</p>
<h3>Cheer Collection &#8211; Luxury Down Alternative</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-19240 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm.jpg" alt="Cheer Collection mattress topper installed under bedspread" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-885x590.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-810x540.jpg 810w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-320x213.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cheer-collection-sm-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ASB1DS8/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cheer Collection &#8211; Luxury Down Alternative</a> doesn’t offer much in the way of spine support, but it does provide softness without sinking too deeply. If you’re looking to cushion your joints and improve your bed without a large investment, the Cheer Collection is a good choice. If you have back pain and need a firm surface, you should probably look elsewhere.</p>
<p>This topper is heavy and thick, so it doesn’t shift during the night. It has a baffle box construction so the filling doesn’t shift either, but they are almost overfilled so that it has a textured look and feels like small pillows sewn together.

<p>The <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sertapedic-Superior-Loft-Down-Alternative-Mattress-Pad/22027240" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sertapedic &#8211; Superior Loft Down</a> is a simple and cost-effective solution to make your mattress more supportive and comfortable. It is technically a mattress pad so it offers more protection against contaminants and stains than our other finalists, but it has more thickness than a typical mattress pad and therefore the feel of a pillow top.</p>
<p>The Sertapedic is more cushiony than it is firm, so it would be better for a side sleeper. It doesn’t shift in the middle of the night and doesn’t run hot (which can be a problem for down alternative toppers), so if you’re looking for something basic and budget-friendly, the Sertapedic is a viable option.</p>
<h3>Linenspa &#8211; 2-Inch Gel Memory Foam</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MRL0H2B/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linenspa &#8211; 2-Inch Gel Memory Foam</a> is a low-density foam, so it provides some support but is softer than would be preferable for a back or stomach sleeper. It had the longest recovery time of the memory foam mattresses we tested, meaning that it has very little bounce, but it was excellent at absorbing motion.</p>
<p>Most of the queen size mattress toppers we tested measured 60 x 80 inches, but the Linenspa is slightly smaller all around at 59 x 79 inches. This gives it a little less support at the edges and meant that it didn’t line up as well as the other finalists on our mattress.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that this topper had a stronger smell than our other finalists and suffered from large tears when moved, rolled and stored, we wouldn’t recommend it for most people. If your priorities are to purchase an inexpensive topper with more softness than support and you desire a gel-infused memory foam to keep you cool at night, the Linenspa would meet your needs.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Choosing the best mattress topper really depends on the position in which you sleep, whether you share a bed and if you want to add softness or support to your mattress. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072FQKJFN/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HOFISH &#8211; Gel Infused Memory Foam</a> is a good option for side sleepers who share a bed. It has an excellent price point, making it available to most consumers. The HOFISH is best if you’re looking to add a cooling feature to your present mattress or to make it softer. If you sleep on your back or stomach, this memory foam probably won’t provide enough support.</p>
<p>If you can afford a luxury upgrade or are a back/stomach sleeper looking for more support, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZZPF8O/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Organic Textiles &#8211; Organic Latex Topper</a>. It does run hot at night, however, and may be more than you’re willing to spend to fix your current mattress. We also wouldn’t recommend it for side sleepers, since it doesn’t cushion the joints as much as other toppers.</p>
<p>For those looking for a down alternative option, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07547DNWG/?tag=ybdtop-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Duck And Goose Co &#8211; Down Alternative</a> is a quality topper that provides both softness and support. It offers a good middle ground to those seeking a topper that is soft but not overly so, and we love that it’s machine washable. Since it does go through the washing machine, this topper may not last as long as our other top picks.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested the most highly-trusted smoke alarms on the market and ultimately found that you need both the First Alert - SCO501CN and the Kidde - RF-SM-DC for total home protection. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>ased on our review of the product testing literature, consumer reviews, safety agency guidelines and specialty publications to find the best smoke detector, we actually identified two top picks that we recommend you use in tandem: the photoelectric-sensor <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EVO7C2/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN</a> and the ionization-sensor <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S37K/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC</a>. To thoroughly and responsibly safeguard your home, it’s essential to have both types of sensors co-located at each spot in your house.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>As is the case with hard-wired smoke detectors, battery powered units come in a large price range. Battery powered smoke detectors provide virtually all of the safety of a hard-wired system without the inconvenience and expense of construction and the need to connect to a central security panel. The market for these types of units is dominated by <a href="https://www.firstalert.com/products" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert</a> and <a href="http://www.kidde.com/home-safety/en/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kidde</a>, and both of these manufacturers also have several highly rated models online. Our screening involved a four-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Screen for units below $50, with a target range of $25-$35 per unit. Most of the benefits of buying a unit above $35 relate to integrating units with complete home monitoring systems. The essential protective features needed from a smoke detector are available in many units in our target price range. Two outliers were selected (including one higher priced unit from Honeywell) in order to include a range beyond the two dominant manufacturers.</li>
<li>Screen for average online consumer rankings as a function of rating and number of reviews; we sought out units that were very well-liked by consumers and we explored the Q&amp;A section of the reviews to determine whether the units held up to scrutiny from verified purchasers.</li>
<li>A review of the literature relating to residential smoke detectors.</li>
<li>Identify units that cover the spectrum of useful features: interconnectivity for installing multiple units in a home, hush buttons, long life (lithium) batteries and the option to link to a home security panel that in turn notifies the local fire department in the event of a fire (Honeywell &#8211; 5808W3).</li>
</ol>
<p>While there are units that combine both types of sensors in one unit, consumers can be prone to disabling the entire unit as a result of false alarms (typically arising from the ionization sensor), which clearly defeats the entire purpose of early smoke and fire detection. With battery powered units, the entire functionality of the unit depends on whether the battery works properly.</p>
<p>If you are the type of person who is vigilant about setting and resetting alarms, then a unit that touts its capability for detecting both smoke and fire like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AMML0E/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Universal Security Instruments &#8211; SS-770</a> might work well for you. However, installing two types of units is the optimal way to go for most people. The inclusion of a CO detector with a fire and smoke alarm is an added benefit. The “false alarm” dilemma also applies to units with integrated CO detectors: disabling the unit due to a false alarm will render the premises unprotected.</p>
<p>In terms of understanding the critical issue of battery life and when to test batteries, a subreddit discussion on batteries and nuisance alarms is quite helpful. Some of the problems relating to false alarms — such as units sometimes going off in the middle of the night — underscores the importance of having a silence feature for nuisance alarms, particularly for larger homes that require multiple units scattered in different locations throughout a house.</p>
<p>Although we did not test any units that have a voice-silencing feature, there are (pricier) smoke detectors that do have it.</p>
<h2 id="why-trust-us">Why you should trust us</h2>
<p>We reviewed specialist fire protection publications, public and private fire-related research sites and interviewed subject matter experts to understand the essential aspects of <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/guide/fire-safety">home fire protection</a> and the specific features needed to protect one’s home.</p>
<p>One of the most important, if not the most important aspect of installing battery operated smoke detectors is to perform regular battery checks. Absent working batteries, an individual alarm is worthless and a network of linked alarms is seriously compromised.</p>
<p>Combined with the propensity for consumers to disable alarms, the use of battery powered smoke detectors relies as much on consumer maintenance as it does on the equipment itself. It is also important to keep any smoke detector — battery or hardwired — free of dust and debris to ensure reliable performance.</p>
<p>We spoke with Steve Ferraina, a veteran firefighter for the City of Los Angeles who spoke about the importance of maintaining batteries: “While a hardwired system is optimal, it’s understandable that this type of system is not feasible for everyone. If you use battery-powered detectors, it helps to have a built-in reminder — like an automatic order — to check your units.”</p>
<p>Like many experts, Meiche believes that both photoelectric and ionization sensors need to be used in tandem, and if a consumer elects to use a battery system, separate units are the way to go. Ferraina also notes that more expensive is not necessarily better. “We used to give away smoke detectors for free. And as you’d expect, they were on the basic end of the spectrum. But the department would not have given them out if they weren’t excellent units.”</p>
<p>Field testing smoke detectors is by definition a hazardous endeavor that should be carried out in a controlled setting. The <a href="https://www.nist.gov/engineering-laboratory/smoke-alarm-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIST</a>, a division of the US Department of Commerce, is involved in promoting innovation and competitiveness for domestic businesses. The NIST sponsors research papers relating to domestic fire alarm performance, along with establishing performance metrics to inform the development process for products and reduce the incidence of nuisance alarms.</p>
<p>In a NIST technical note <a href="http://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=901646" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Results From a Full-Scale Smoke Alarm Sensitivity Study</a>, T.G. Cleary and A. Chernovsky tested both photoelectric and ionization alarms in a variety of scenarios that varied fabric type (cotton and polyester,) ignition type (smoldering versus flaming), fire location and ventilation. They created a full-scale set at the NIST that included a smoldering sofa and created a matrix for response times under eight different smoldering scenarios.</p>
<p>Overall, the dual sensors performed the best in this study, but the findings for the single alarm types are quite important: the photoelectric sensor units significantly outperformed the ionization units for smoldering scenarios, while the opposite was true for flaming scenarios. Although a dual unit can perform as well or better than co-located separate units, the propensity for operator negligence in terms of replacing batteries makes it more sensible to go with single sensor units.</p>
<p>In 2012, the NBC television network affiliate in Dallas/Fort Worth performed a smoke alarm test with a smoldering sofa. The photoelectric sensors they tested took less than twenty minutes on average to trigger the alarm, while the ionization units took nearly three minutes longer on average — enough extra time for the fire to have already become free burning. In reviewing the results of the test, Don Russell, a professor at Texas A&amp;M noted that in some instances, ionization smoke detectors are simply too slow to respond to a developing fire.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-one">Who needs a home smoke detector?</h2>
<p>The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) estimates that there are 2,300 fatalities annually that occur in approximately 365,000 residential fires in the US. Having working fire alarms in a home is estimated to cut the risk of fire death by approximately one-half.</p>
<p>It is crucial to recognize that smoke alarms do not extinguish a fire, but merely detect the presence of a fire or potential fire. The principal function of a smoke alarm is to alert the occupant of danger and to allow them sufficient time to escape unharmed.</p>
<h3>Lifesaving home safety</h3>
<p>Smoke alarms are essential for home safety; they provide early detection that can prevent damage to property and life-threatening fire and smoke conditions. We probed the literature for recommendations about the safest approach to procuring and installing fire alarms.</p>
<p>As a life safety product, fire alarm testing is performed in settings where simulated fire and smoke conditions are created. The majority of research has therefore been conducted by government agencies such as NIST and <a href="https://www.nfpa.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFPA</a>, in addition to universities.</p>
<h3>Property protection</h3>
<p>The use of smoke alarms is regulated at the state and municipal level, and every jurisdiction has its own regulations pertaining to new construction and existing dwelling units. Additionally, many insurance companies mandate smoke (and CO) alarms as a precondition for providing home insurance. FEMA provides a current list of <a href="http://www.thewfsf.org/sap_usa_files/FEMA_StateSmokeAlarmRequirementsMay2010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state-by-state requirements</a> and guidelines for using home smoke alarms. In addition, both First Alert and Kidde provide regulatory information on their home sites.</p>
<h3>New construction compliance</h3>
<p>For new construction, many states require smoke detectors to be hard-wired to a home’s electrical system, while battery powered units are sufficient for existing dwellings. In most cases, transferring property in instances where there is a lender involved will require that a home is equipped with functioning smoke detectors.</p>
<p>For small apartments that may only need to monitor smoke in one location, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AMML0E/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Universal Security Instruments &#8211; SS-770</a> provides excellent ionization detection without an interconnect feature. Although the Universal unit is the most budget-friendly detector we tested (approximately $21/unit) it is the only one to use proprietary technology — Universal Smoke Sensing Technology — that detects both fast burning and smoldering fires. The Universal SS-901-2C uses a nine-volt battery versus the more commonly found AA batteries. The Universal would make a good companion to a photoelectric detection sensor that also uses a nine-volt battery.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>Like many home electronics products, smoke detectors are available with a dizzying array of optional features. While the essential purpose of a smoke detector is to make noise when smoke or fire is detected, there are many other options to consider. Our analysis of what consumers find most valuable includes the following features:</p>
<p><b>Power source:</b> The choice is between battery-powered versus units that are hard-wired into an electrical system. Battery powered units do not require installing wiring behind walls and are far more convenient to install. On the flip side, it is essential to regularly check and replace batteries and to keep the units clean.</p>
<p><b>Type of sensor: </b>Photoelectric sensors provide better detection for slow-burning, long-smoldering fires, while ionization detectors perform better in the event of fast burning, flaming fire. To safeguard your home, it is essential to have both types of units co-located at each required spot. There are many units that combine both types of sensors, but we do not recommend these in the even that they are disabled from nuisance false alarms.</p>
<p><b>Carbon monoxide monitor:</b> Having a carbon monoxide monitor included in a unit adds some cost, but it is an essential thing to have. One of the units — either the photoelectric sensor or the ionization sensor should also include a CO monitor.</p>
<p><b>Smart detection for the location of fire and smoke: </b>In the range of units that we tested, only one, our joint top pick First Alert model, provided a voice alert for the specific room location of a fire. For children or older people who may not respond as readily to a horn or beep alarm, this can be a desirable feature.</p>
<p><b>Silence buttons:</b> Anyone who has a working fire alarm and cooks is aware that now and then, a non-life-threatening cooking mishap can set off a nuisance alarm. Having a silence button makes it easy to temporarily halt the alarm — or multiple alarms if they are interconnected — rather than yanking out a battery.</p>
<h3>Hard-wired vs. battery powered</h3>
<p>For anyone who is not buying or building a new home or undertaking a substantial renovation of their home, battery-powered smoke detectors are a sensible choice. Over time, digital and wireless technology have made battery powered smoke detectors as sophisticated as their hard-wired siblings. Features such as interconnection, voice alerts, programming specific areas of a home and remote home monitoring are available in higher end battery powered units.</p>
<p>While there are many benefits to having a hard-wired system, including the ability to connect to a remote home monitoring service to automatically dispatch emergency help, this type of system is installed primarily to comply with local building codes. While battery powered smoke detectors are at risk for operator negligence in terms of battery replacement, one major benefit is that they will continue to operate in the event of an electrical interruption in a home.</p>
<p>More sophisticated (and expensive) battery powered units like the Honeywell 5808W3 are designed to link to central security panels and are even used for commercial installations. In effect, the Honeywell is a battery unit for people who want the sophistication of a hard-wired smoke detector but who do not want to rip into their walls.</p>
<h3>The Two Main Types of Smoke and Fire Detection Sensors</h3>
<p><b>Photoelectric sensors</b> work when smoke enters the alarm and deflects the light emanating from an LED beam. As the results of the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/smoke-alarm-performance-kitchen-fires-and-nuisance-alarm-scenarios?pub_id=912596" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleary NIST</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Five-Nights-That-Could-Save-Your-Life-Not-All-Smoke-Detectors-Are-Alike-133584358.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBC</a> studies confirm, photoelectric sensors are more effective at detecting slow-smoldering fires, including fires that can smolder for hours before becoming inflamed. A common source of a slow smoldering fire is a cigarette butt left burning in a sofa.</p>
<p><b>Ionization detection</b> works by having a tiny amount — typically measured in units called “kilo becquerels” — of the radioactive material Americium 241, that acts to ionize nitrogen and oxygen to create a small electrical current that in turn triggers an alarm. The main drawback for ionization alarms is that they are prone to false/nuisance alarms and are consequently also prone to being disconnected. However, for free-burning fires, ionization detectors are generally more responsive than photoelectric models.</p>
<p>In research focused on the topic of disabled alarms, a study of smoke alarms in rural Alaska homes found that the incidence of nuisance alarms in homes with ionization smoke detectors was eight times higher than for photoelectric alarms. The danger of nuisance alarms was manifested by the fact that ionization smoke alarms were almost 5 times more likely to be disconnected 6 months after installation compared with photoelectric alarms.</p>
<p>A Texas A&amp;M study that took into account disabled alarms concluded that the probability of a fatality was 19.8% with ionization alarms when used exclusively, but only 3.99% with photoelectric alarms. Based partly on these findings, the International Association of Fire Fighters, the largest firefighter union in the world, supports legislation making photoelectric alarms a mandatory requirement for fire and building codes.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>Our testing involved basic, high-level testing in a non-laboratory (home) setting. Most extensive testing of smoke detectors involves either a university or institutional setting in which a highly controlled environment and scientific methodology can be employed.</p>
<h3>Battery test</h3>

<p>We inspected each unit out of the package to evaluate its convenience and basic design. The First Alert &#8211; SCO5CN came with two AA batteries already installed and immediately ready for testing. All of our tested units shipped with batteries included, which is good from a convenience standpoint, but leaves consumers guessing about how fresh they are.</p>
<p>Experts recommend that batteries should be replaced with an automatic reminder like being part of a battery shipping program or on one’s birthday. For long-life lithium batteries, it probably makes sense to check them once a year. Sealed units like the First Alert &#8211; “Atom” P1010 are designed to be discarded when they fail a battery test.</p>
<p>All of our units responded to the manufacturer’s recommended battery test by emitting a chirping or horn alarm.</p>
<h3>Interconnecting and programming</h3>

<p>Interconnecting smoke detectors allows for notifying occupants about a smoke or fire condition anywhere in their home. With linked (interconnected) units, if an alarm sounds in a bedroom, for example, all linked units will sound as well. Only the same model units can be linked.</p>
<p>Programming units generally refer to being able to assign a specific location to a specific alarm unit. In addition to triggering all the interconnected units in a home, programming provides a voice alert that denotes the specific room/location of a smoke or fire event.</p>
<p>All home smoke detectors have the basic functionality required to detect fire: when smoke or fire is sensed, an alarm sounds. Unit pricing is a function of added features, and the most important step up in pricing and functionality from basic units to more sophisticated ones is the capability for wireless interconnection. Basic units are generally in the $20-25 range per unit, while interconnectable units are more commonly in the $25-35 range like the First Alert and Kidde models we tested.</p>
<p>Another very desirable feature — especially for the more false alarm-prone ionization units — is to be able to temporarily silence a false alarm either through a voice command, pushing a button on the unit itself or either way. If you need to remove the batteries from a unit to silence it, clearly there is a risk that you will neglect to reinstall them and consequently not be protected.</p>
<p>We tested two units, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EVO7C2/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S37K/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC</a> that can be linked with other (same model) units. The First Alert is easily set up by depressing the main test button in sequence with the unit to be added. In addition, there are preprogrammed locations that allow a user to select the location for any room in the house. In the event of a fire or CO event, all the units issue a voice alarm noting the location of the fire.</p>
<p>The wireless setup for these units is different. For the First Alert, additional units can be added by going through a sequence of depressing buttons on the “original” unit and subsequently on the units to be added. The Kidde unit employs a more robust technology that allows the user to set a dip switch panel on the back of the unit to a common pattern. If left in default mode with all the switches off, the units will connect with one another. As is the case with virtually all home smoke detectors, different brands and models cannot be linked with one another.</p>
<h3>False alarm hush</h3>

<p>Our two top picks each have silence buttons that deactivate the units in the event of a false alarm. The First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN cooperated right away (both programmed units quieted immediately once the button was depressed), while the Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC required depressing the button for about one second. This proved a bit tricky; letting go of the button too quickly made the unit cycle through its programming options, and holding it too long didn&#8217;t silence the units.</p>
<p>The cute little <a href="https://www.firstalert.com/product/atom-photoelectric-smoke-alarm-with-10yrbattery" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert &#8211; Atom P1010</a> has a silence button that quiets the unit for 10 minutes. If the unit continues to send an alarm in a false alarm scenario, then it must be replaced since it is a sealed unit with a (long-life) lithium battery.</p>
<p>The sophisticated Honeywell unit we tested can be hushed by depressing its test switch. In the hair dryer test recommended in the manual, the test switch silenced the unit.</p>
<p>Our Universal Security Systems model, the least expensive unit we tested, does not have a silence feature. Since it is an ionization alarm, albeit with Universal’s proprietary “Universal Smoke Sensing Technology,” it is likely more prone to nuisance alarms than photoelectric sensors.</p>

<p>We recommend using two different units together as top picks.</p>
<p>The tandem of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EVO7C2/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S37K/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC</a> battery powered smoke detectors provides complete home fire and carbon monoxide protection when co-located at required locations throughout a home. Co-locating these units, one with a photoelectric sensor for slow-burning fires and the other with an ionization sensor for flaming fires, provides redundant protection in the event that one of the alarms is disabled from the removal of a battery due to a false alarm, or in the event that the batteries die in one of the units.</p>
<p>Together, our two top picks allow a homeowner to set up as many units as required throughout a home and have security in knowing that a smoke or fire event in one location will alert everyone at once.</p>

This photoelectric unit with interconnect capability can cover everything from a small apartment to a large home and protect you from smoke, fire and carbon monoxide with voice notifications. We recommend that this unit is paired with the Kidde - RF-SM-DC, our top pick for an ionization sensor unit.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EVO7C2/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Both of our top picks excel at their respective specialties: the First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN (photoelectric sensor) for detecting slow-burning, smoldering types of fires, like those that might originate with a cigarette butt in a sofa cushion, while the Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC (ionization sensor) is excellent at detecting fast burning flaming fires.</p>
<p>One of the key reasons we recommend the First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN is for its voice alert feature, which is more likely to wake a child versus a sound alarm. This unit is extremely well and extensively reviewed by consumers and has a very friendly user interface. This unit is simple to test, program and uses AA batteries that can be tested easily. And to top it off, it can be programmed to voice announce the specific (room) location of a fire.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S37K/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kidde-alarm-cta.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Top pick ionization unit: Kidde - RF-SM-DC</h3><p>The Kidde - RF-SM-DC is an ionization sensor wireless unit with interconnect capability that is very sensitive to detecting fast burning fires, and like the First Alert - SCO501CN is simple to set up, install and program. We recommend pairing it with the First Alert unit to provide complete home protection from fire and smoke events.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S37K/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>While the Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC has a voice alert for the type of detection (fire or CO), it does not announce a specific location. However, it is a highly responsive ionization unit that pairs well with the First Alert because it also can be interconnected with other units. The Kidde is a natural partner for the First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN since it also uses AA batteries, and can be interconnected to multiple units throughout a home.</p>
<p>Our recommendation for both types of units — photoelectric and ionization — is reinforced by the official policy position of the <a href="https://www.nfpa.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFPA</a>, a leading fire protection educational and advisory association and learning resource. Along with the venerated consumer safety and compliance organization <a href="https://www.ul.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Underwriters Laboratory</a> (UL), the NFPA’s official position is the consumers need both types of sensors in their homes. All the units that we tested carried one of UL’s certification marks. The inclusion of this mark means that representative products have satisfied UL’s requirements.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The best protection comes from having two separate units — one using ionization sensor technology and the other photoelectric; both of our top picks function best with one another since they have complementary types of sensors.</li>
<li>The photoelectric First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN has many features and functions just as well as more expensive hardwired units as long as batteries are checked frequently and the unit’s kept free of dust and dirt.</li>
<li>The ionization Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC is a breeze to program and gives the security of very rapid alarms for fast burning fires.</li>
<li>Programming for alarms to announce specific rooms/locations of a smoke or fire event is desirable, but not essential; the First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN has this feature.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Universal Security Instruments &#8211; SS-770</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AMML0E/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Universal Security Instruments &#8211; SS-770</a> scores high marks for plug-and-play simplicity in an inexpensive package. Lacking interconnect capability, the instructions, set-up and maintenance are relatively straightforward for this unit, although some reviewers have experienced a higher than normal incidence of false alarms. As expected for a lower price unit, there is no voice alarm or ability to silence the unit from voice or with a button on the unit.</p>
<h3>First Alert &#8211; P1010</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17508 size-full" src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010.jpg" alt="First Alert P1010" width="1890" height="1262" srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010.jpg 1890w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-610x407.jpg 610w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-768x513.jpg 768w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-885x591.jpg 885w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-295x197.jpg 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-360x240.jpg 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-414x276.jpg 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-320x214.jpg 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/first-alert-p1010-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A0M4EYU/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert &#8211; P1010</a> is an elegant little photoelectric smoke detector that uses a 10-year life lithium battery for a power source, and is the best-designed product in the category. The entire unit is approximately 1-¾” by 1-¾” and is barely visible, especially if it is mounted on a white wall. As with the Universal model, this unit cannot be interconnected and is recommended only for smaller dwelling units, and only if it is paired with an ionization sensor unit.</p>
<h3>Kidde &#8211; KN-COSM-BA</h3>
<p>The ionization sensor <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S0PA/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kidde &#8211; KN-COSM-BA</a> includes a CO detector, but does not have an interconnection feature. We like it for its easy battery replacement and push-button hush feature. For a small apartment that only needs fire detection in one location, the Kidde &#8211; KN-COSM-BA would make a good companion for a photoelectric unit that does not have an interconnection feature. When pairing ionization and photoelectric units, it makes sense to find units that use the same batteries to put them on the same change cycle.</p>
<h3>Honeywell &#8211; 5808W3</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017KD4FA/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell &#8211; 5808W3</a> is in a somewhat different category from the other units tested in that it has the capability to be connected to a home monitoring system, such as the Honeywell 5800 series, that is connected to a local fire department. This photoelectric sensor is best considered for homeowners who are seeking to implement a whole home security system.</p>
<p>The Honeywell 5808W3 is the most expensive unit that we tested, and it can also be used for commercial installations with matching Honeywell monitoring receivers. It uses a 10-year life lithium battery, and the overall build quality is excellent.</p>
<p>In keeping with a unit that can cross over to commercial applications, the Honeywell has the least friendly user interface of all our tested models. The faceplate of the unit is a blank sheet of plastic with two LEDs, and to test the unit, a tool has to be inserted throughout the plastic housing.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>First Alert touts itself as “America’s Safety Company” and is headquartered in Aurora, Illinois. It sponsors a fire safety initiative called “Safe Kids USA,” and provides smoke detectors at a reduced cost for low-income families. Kidde is a division of United Technologies, a large, diversified public company. The company roots can be traced back to 1917 when it produced the first fire and CO detection system for ships.</p>
<p>Although there are battery powered smoke detectors that can do everything in one package, we strongly recommend that consumers install two different types of units — one using ionization detection technology, and another using photoelectric technology — in each pertinent location in their home.</p>
<p>Our two top picks for a battery powered smoke detector, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EVO7C2/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PC5S37K/?tag=ybdsmo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC</a> represent two top performers from the dominant industry players in the smoke detector market. These units work well together since they employ different fire and smoke detection technology: photoelectric sensing for the First Alert and ionization for the Kidde.</p>
<p>We believe that consumers will be delighted with the First Alert &#8211; SCO501CN, a top performer for critical photoelectric smoke and fire detection. Its voice notification, interconnection capability and programmable, room-by-room functionality make this a cornerstone of your home protection strategy when combined with an ionization detector like the Kidde &#8211; RF-SM-DC.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We spent weeks testing ten of the top fans on the market, and found that the Vornado - Vfan blew away the competition. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter weeks of testing, we&#8217;ve determined that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TX79C1O/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage</a> is our current top choice for best fan. Inspired by the company’s original model from 1945, the VFAN Vintage has an authentic vintage look. It operates both powerfully and quietly, which is the combo you want in a bedroom or living room fan. You pay more for the vintage aesthetic and more durable coated metal construction, but if style as well as efficacy is important to you, the Vornado is worth the price. At less than a third the price of our top pick, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesis &#8211; Avalon</a> was the second-most powerful fan we tested, yet remains lightweight, relatively quiet and keeps a low profile.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-found">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>There is a wide variety of fans on the market, so we started by researching which fans were best for the home and bedroom. Once we had a list of the top rated fans, we vetted them through reviews on Reddit, Amazon and real testing sites such as The Wirecutter.</p>
<p>With a list of nine finalists, we read through articles on how to measure airflow and designed our testing process with a senior manufacturing engineer with over 15 years of combined experience in the automotive, medical and defense industries.</p>
<p>Once we developed two methods to test wind velocity and circulation and came up with our numbers, we used these fans as any consumer would: to cool down on a hot summer day. In the end, the real world testing influenced our top picks as much as our calculations.</p>
<p>The cooling effect that you feel is not something that can be directly measured since a fan will not cool a room, but it will help lower your body temperature due to evaporative cooling on your skin. If you are looking for a unit that will lower the temperature in the room, you should consider installing an air conditioner. We recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BN38X4D/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frigidaire &#8211; 8000 BTU</a> as the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-window-air-conditioner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best window air conditioner</a>.</p>

<h2 id="features-to-consider">Features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> You want the style and design of a fan to fit in line with your room and personal needs without spoiling the interior design.</p>
<p><strong>Noise:</strong> Since a fan is often placed in a living room or bedroom, you want it to be quiet enough that you can hold a conversation without shouting. Our 10 fans averaged a reading of 63.86 decibels. (This is about the noise level of the inside of an average restaurant.) Bonus points if the fan has a quiet setting so you can use it to fall asleep at night.</p>
<p><strong>Oscillation:</strong> The ability to push out large volumes of air makes a fan better able to circulate a room. However, even a fan with low CFM (cubic feet per minute) measurements can provide a wide area of coverage if it oscillates.</p>
<p><strong>Removable grill:</strong> A fan can gather dust quickly and push it out into the room. A fan that’s easy to clean, such as one with a removable grill, makes it more likely that you will clean it on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Remote control:</strong> For the sake of convenience, a remote control is handy to have, especially if the fan has remote control housing for storage when not in use. You may never have to leave your couch again.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> The lighter the fan, the easier it is to move around the room or even switch rooms.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-fans">Types of fans we tested</h2>
<p>We reviewed the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-tower-fan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best tower fan</a> in another article, so for this article we focused on the following three types of household fans.</p>
<p><strong>Floor:</strong> A floor fan sits on the floor and tends to be larger than other fans. Since heat rises and the coolest air is at floor level, this will push the cooler air upwards. This makes a floor fan a good choice for home, even though many floor fans are used in industrial applications.</p>
<p><strong>Pedestal:</strong> An oscillating pedestal fan generally has large blades that are capable of cooling larger rooms. All the pedestal fans we tested have an adjustable stand. You can use the adjustable stand to change the height of a pedestal fan, and it usually includes both a remote control and digital display so you can adjust the settings from your couch or bed.</p>
<p><strong>Personal:</strong> Also referred to as a table fan, a personal fan has a small, compact size. This makes it ideal for placing on desks, tables or countertops so you can stay cool in your personal space. It is typically used if you are working at home or situated at an office desk.</p>

<h3>Circulation</h3>
<p>Fans can improve air circulation, which means they can move a large volume of air throughout a room. We conducted the circulation test two different ways. First, we used an anemometer and a makeshift wind funnel to measure the rate of air flow. Second, we gauged circulation in a real world setting using testers on hot, humid days with temperatures in the high 80’s.<br />
We used the anemometer to measure the volume of air each fan could move.</p>
<p>Then we averaged the velocities and calculated the air flow rate in cubic feet per minute (CFM), a standard of measurement used in the HVAC industry. To give you an example of airflow measured in CFM, 300 to 400 CFM per ton of cooling is needed for an air conditioning unit to run properly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Capture all the air coming off the fan</strong><br />
We used a trash bag to &#8220;funnel&#8221; all of the air coming off the fan down to an opening of 6&#215;6 inches, then measured the air speed that comes out through the opening of the trash bag in linear feet per minute.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Measure the air speed</strong><br />
To measure the air speed, we turned on the fan to its highest setting, and let it speed up. Then we checked to make sure there wasn’t air blowing out somewhere other than the measured opening. We used our anemometer to measure an average speed for the air coming through the opening in linear feet per minute.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Calculate CFM</strong><br />
To determine the number of cubic feet per minute the fan moves, we multiplied the rate in linear feet by .25 square feet (since a 6&#215;6 inche square is a .5x.5’ square). For example, the GreenTech had a speed of 748.1 feet per minute. Multiplying this number by .25 square feet gave us a CFM of 187. We compared our results to data published by the fan manufacturers, when available.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Conduct real world testing</strong><br />
The above calculations may have little bearing on a decision to purchase a fan. With that fact in mind, we also set up a real world test that is perhaps more useful for the average person.</p>
<p>Our testers sat across the room from a fan to consider its capacity to cool them down and to circulate air. We asked our testers whether they felt cooler, and if it felt like the air was moving around the room in a way that made them feel more comfortable. Then, we recorded their responses.</p>
<p>Once we were armed with data, we compared our numbers to tester responses and looked for correlations. We found that the bigger fans were able to push a higher volume of air, even if the blades are moving more slowly.</p>
<p>The Air King, at 20 inches, outperformed the other finalists both in numbers and real life circulation. The Genesis &#8211; Avalon, at more than half the price of the Air King, pushed out a comparable volume of air. Our other floor fan, the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage was another top performer. Of the pedestal fans, the Klarstein rated nearly as well as the floor fans.</p>
<p>We were unable to get accurate numbers for the Vornado &#8211; Zippi, which has exposed fabric blades that touched the plastic bag and impeded the air flow.</p>
<h3>Wind velocity</h3>
<p>We tested the peak air speed with an anemometer at a typical distance we&#8217;d use a fan. To capture the speed of an air stream coming off the fan, we used a cardboard “sampling” tube. Our tube measured 3 feet long and 6 inches in diameter. This gave us a straight path for the air that was the same for each test.</p>
<p>We placed each fan so its louvre blades weren&#8217;t blowing air up or down but were parallel to the ground. Then we held the tube parallel to the ground and directly touching the face of the fan to help isolate it from any vortexes. We turn the fan on to its highest setting and measured the wind speed at the end of the tube. We moved both the tube and meter around different parts of the fan and logged the fastest speeds we could capture.</p>
<p>Since this test only measured the speed of a tiny air stream, a high number here from a small fan isn&#8217;t unexpected. However, we found that the wind velocity was higher in our largest fan and our floor fans had the highest speeds.</p>
<p>The Air King reached top speeds of 13.4 miles per hour (MPH), once again outperforming our other finalists. The Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage was a close second at 11.4 MPH, and the Genesis reached top speeds of 10.5 MPH. Among the pedestal fans, the Klarstein performed the best (and was nearly comparable to the floor fans) at 10.3 MPH.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the personal fans had the lowest speeds. The best performer here was the Holmes at 7.8 MPH.</p>
<h3>Sound test</h3>
<p>The noise of fans are usually calculated as sones, a subjective measurement of how sound is sensed. <strong>The lower the sone rating, the quieter the fan will be.</strong> You may see this number advertised by manufacturers, although more typically this is used with exhaust fans or fans that serve as a backup when an HVAC system doesn’t work properly.</p>
<p>Typically, the sone level is measured at the maximum cubic feet per minute (speed), which we previously tested. You can also convert sone ratings to decibels to give you an example of how loud a fan sounds. For example, a sone rating of 2.0 would have the approximate noise level of a residential area at night.</p>
<p>For a practical sound level measurement, we used a sound decibel meter to measure decibels at an arm’s length away from the grill and set the fan to its highest setting. Unsurprisingly, our personal fans such as the Vornado &#8211; Zippi and Honeywell were the quietest at 48 and 59.8 decibels, respectively. The Holmes was in the mid-range at 64.5 decibels, despite being a personal fan.</p>
<p>The quietest floor fan was the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage, which was even quieter than the Holmes at 62.4 decibels. The quietest pedestal fan was the Best Choice at 64.6 decibels.</p>
<p>The Air King was exceptionally loud, rating at 79.2 decibels (or approximately the sound of a vacuum from 3 feet away). It also had the most unpleasing acoustics, as it starts out with a rattling sound, and on full speed it buzzes like a swarm of bees.</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>No matter how quiet or powerful a fan can be, usability is a key factor when choosing a fan that works best for you. For this portion of the testing, we considered how easy it was to interface with the fan, how safe it seemed and how easy it was to keep clean.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly</strong><br />
As we unpacked the boxes, we considered ease of assembly. The floor and personal fans arrived in one piece, while the pedestal fans needed to be assembled. The Klarstein was the easiest of the pedestal fans to assemble, with a two piece grill that snapped together. Both the Rowenta and Best Choice required some complicated maneuvering to fit together. This also became an issue when we cleaned the fans later.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong><br />
Once assembled, we considered design and aesthetics. We took note of the unique, modern look of the bladeless GreenTech and the sleek design of the Klarstein (especially compared to the other pedestal fans). In terms of sheer style, the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage would hold its own with any interior decorating scheme. It is simply a fan meant to be displayed. The Vornado &#8211; Zippi is another fan from the same maker that stands out on a desk.</p>
<p>The Air King, with its rough metal edges and exposed screws, has an unrefined, industrial look that may not vibe in a home setting. The Genesis is comparable to the Air King in terms of size and style, but tends to blend into the background much better.</p>
<p><strong>Stability</strong><br />
The first thing we looked for when we turned the fans on was whether or not each fan kept steady. We placed the pedestal fans on carpet and hard flooring, the personal fans on a desktop and the floor fans on carpet, hard flooring and a kitchen chair (since floor fans should by nature be more versatile in their placement). Nearly all of the fans were stable on their highest setting, the one exception being the Air King, which wobbles on “take off” and then seems to get its bearings.</p>
<p><strong>Cleanability</strong><br />
You don’t have to worry about dust collecting on the blades with the bladeless GreenTech: All you need to do is wipe down the face and base with a soft cloth. If there is any dust accumulation on the back grill, you can clean it with a vacuum. It was the only fan we tested that didn’t require the removal of any parts to clean, making it the most simple.</p>
<p>Two of our personal fans, the Holmes and Honeywell advertise a removable grill that you can easily pop off to dust the blades. However, both models require you to remove the Phillips head screws at the back or base of the grill, so it isn’t as easy as we would have liked.</p>
<p>The grill wire of the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage can be released from the support tabs using a flat screwdriver, and snapped back into place, making it easier to reach the blades than our other floor models. It is difficult to reach the blades of the Genesis and Air King, since you unscrew the grill to clean and then reassemble it.</p>
<p>For the models that require you to take it apart to clean the blades, we came across several tips from users that may help you reduce the number of times you have to perform a deep clean. Among the tools recommended were canned air, Swiffer dusters and cotton swabs. We also used microfiber cleaning cloths to dust the grill, preemptively removing dust before we needed to clean the blades.</p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong><br />
We initially conceived that we would use a pencil to test safety, by seeing if it would fit through the grate and whether or not it left a mark on the the side of the pencil when stopped by blades. However, after concern that this would damage the fans, we went with a much simpler test: seeing if our pinky finger (roughly the size of a child’s index finger) would fit through the grate with the fan turned off.</p>
<p>Styled after its 1945 predecessor (the fans of those days had more exposed blades), the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage was the only fan that caused us to raise our eyebrows. Our pinky finger fit a little deeper than we felt safe, were the fan to be on and a child involved. Needless to say, you would want to keep children and pets away from any fan with a moving blade. If you are concerned about safety, the bladeless GreenTech would be your best bet. The Vornado &#8211; Zippi is another safe alternative, with fabric blades that won’t harm little fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Usability</strong><br />
The floor fans and personal fans are fairly straightforward in terms of operation: you use a knob to turn them on. Therefore we didn’t concern ourselves with usability as much as the pedestal fans.</p>
<p>For all the fans, we measured cord length with a ruler, since nobody wants a fan that doesn’t reach their outlets. The cords typically ran to 5 or 6 feet, with several fans on the shorter side of the spectrum at 5 feet. We favored the 6 feet, although the 8-foot cord of the GreenTech was handy. The Air King had 20 feet of cord, which was more than necessary for our home needs.</p>
<p>For the pedestal fans, we interacted with them without reading the user manuals first, to determine whether or not the display symbols were intuitive. Since the pedestal fans came with a remote, we checked the product manuals for specifications and tested whether the remotes worked at the ranges claimed.</p>
<p>The Klarstein was intuitive to interface with, both on the LCD digital display and remote control, despite having multiple settings, speeds and a timer. We especially liked the fact that the remote control had the same dial system to adjust speed as on the fan. Another feature we liked is the auto-dimming display, which turns off automatically after a few moments so you don’t have a distracting glow in your bedroom at night.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, some users have reported that their television remote changes the fan settings. We didn’t experience this with any of the remotes we used around it: television, DVD and Wii.</p>
<p>In comparison, the Best Choice  has an easy to read digital display, but the bright blue light never shuts off, which can make it hard to sleep when placed in a bedroom. The remote control is clearly labeled with words (rather than icons like the Klarstein) and easy to use.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a fan with a lot of bells and whistles, you may want to look elsewhere. However, if you want a sturdy and powerful fan that has a neat vintage aesthetic, doesn’t wobble and is quiet and powerful, we highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TX79C1O/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage</a>. We tested the VFAN Sr, although the line comes in several sizes and even has a pedestal option.</p>

Most importantly though, it has high power but operates quietly.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TX79C1O/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>For a fan that looks old-fashioned, the VFAN has one of the widest vertical tilt ranges of the fans we tested. It can tilt 180 degrees in either direction; the only thing that stops it from tilting 360 degrees is the cord. It doesn’t oscillate, but it doesn’t need to. The twin air cones, deep-pitched propeller blades and vortex action mean that air moves outward in a spiral, so it travels further. Even before we verified this with our circulation test, we could feel the breeze rippling in all corners of the room.</p>
<p>It is the most expensive fan we tested, but it’s also made with a quality built to last. It has a durable construction and is made with high-quality materials.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Vornado brand has been around since 1945, giving them plenty of time to hone their craft. One thing that hasn’t changed? The retro style of the Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage that recreates the classic look.</li>
<li>You don’t need a degree in aerodynamics to appreciate the effects of the company’s signature vortex action, which pushes out a large volume of air and allows it to travel further.</li>
<li>While it doesn’t oscillate, it has a vertical tilt that beats out nearly all of the other finalists.</li>
<li>Despite a high wind velocity, it is one of the most quiet floor fans we tested.</li>

<p>We found that overall, floor fans are more powerful than pedestal fans. But that doesn’t mean you’re out of luck with a pedestal fan. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYTD184/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klarstein &#8211; Silent Storm</a> delivers consistent high wind speed and circulates air better than the other pedestal fans we tested; in fact, its performance rivaled that of a floor fan. You end up getting the power of a floor fan with the versatility of a pedestal fan. In our opinion, this makes it worth the high price tag (when compared with similar models).</p>
<p>If you like fancy features, you may be especially enticed to buy the Klarstein. One of its coolest features is the comfort mode, which automatically adjusts the speed based on the current room temperature. We also liked the night mode, which turns down the decibels and automatically switches off.</p>

<p>In the same vein, the auto-dimming display means there is nothing blinking at you when you try to go to sleep at night, and it makes the design look more sleek during the day. The natural mode, which simulates the wind, was less jarring than in other models with a similar feature.</p>
<p>On the silent mode, it measures only 40.4 decibels, perfect if you want a gentle breeze at night without the noise. It is one of the louder models on full speed, slightly above our average decibel rating, but it didn’t impact our opinion about the Klarstein. We can honestly say that we didn’t find any drawbacks with this fan, although you may want to keep in mind that the price tag is on the high side compared to other fans we tested.</p>
<p>The Klarstein comes with 26 different speed settings, and w<span style="font-weight: 400;">hile 26 settings may be more than any user actually needs, we loved being able to give the dial a quick spin to easily land within the range we wanted (high, medium, low). The multiple settings are thanks to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brushless DC motor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BLDC), which gives you a wide speed range due to a linear torque curve. BLDC motors have higher efficiency, run quietly and have a long service life &#8212; all features you look for in a quality fan. </span></p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A powerful 16-inch fan on a tilt-resistant base, the Klarstein &#8211; Silent Storm is a strong performer with a sleek look.</li>
<li>The height can be adjusted by up to 6 inches, and the vertical tilt adjusted by 30 degrees. It also has 90-degree oscillation. With all these options, you can direct the wind stream where ever you need it to go.</li>
<li>Change speed settings (up to 26) with an easy to use control wheel on either the unit or the remote control.</li>
<li>It has a brushless DC motor and operates on 35W, so it is economical even at its highest speeds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-budget-pick">The budget pick: Genesis &#8211; Avalon</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesis &#8211; Avalon</a> is a fitting choice for households that move their fan from room to room. It has a lightweight construction, weighing only 8 pounds, and features an easy-carry handle. For something so lightweight, we were pleasantly surprised at how stable it is on the floor or a table (especially given its high wind speeds). When bumped into, it doesn’t knock over easily, either.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/genesis-avalon.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Budget Pick: Genesis</h3><p>Lightweight, portable and powerful are the key features of this high velocity floor fan.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>It has a 360-degree vertical tilt, so you can push a large amount of air (it tested as our second highest rated fan in terms of volume) into the room at whatever angle you wish. It has a durable copper motor, so not only does it reach high wind speeds, it has a reputation for lasting a long time. This makes the low price even more exceptional.</p>
<p>The design is fairly minimalist, encased in a hard black plastic, but it certainly won’t clash with your decor. It blends in to any area it is placed. We also appreciated the tightly spaced grill, which keeps small prying hands away from the blades.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will say that this fan&#8217;s low price is somewhat evident in its design. It’s harder to clean the blades of the Genesis, and the all-plastic construction makes it feel and look more flimsy than our other top picks.</span></p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In terms of volume and wind speed, the Genesis &#8211; Avalon was the second most powerful fan we tested.</li>
<li>At just 8 pounds, it is exceptionally lightweight for such a powerful fan.</li>
<li>Able to pivot a full 360 degrees, you can direct the air stream anywhere you choose, even directly up or down.</li>
<li>With well covered blades and a <a href="https://www.ul.com/aboutul/what-we-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UL approved</a> safety fused plug, you can feel comfortable with its safety features.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Holmes &#8211; Lil Blizzard</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J07RMU/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Holmes &#8211; Lil Blizzard</a> is perfectly sized to fit on your desk, helping you circulate air so you can feel comfortable and work more efficiently. After all, you can’t type with two hands if you’re fanning yourself with one. It isn’t the quietest personal fan, but it isn’t so loud that your office mates would complain. It oscillates smoothly, can be tilted up or down (30 degrees in either direction) and can be locked in place.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J07RMU/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/holmes.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Personal: Holmes</h3><p>While the Holmes can circulate air in a small area, it’s an ideal breeze-maker for your desk.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J07RMU/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>It can also be easily used on a bedside table to cool yourself at night or on a kitchen counter to offset the heat from cooking. It’s priced low enough you could buy more than one, and it’s lightweight enough to easily move around if you want to save space.</p>
<h3>Air King &#8211; 9212</h3>
<p>You could say the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007Q3RHK/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Air King &#8211; 9212</a> blows away the competition in terms of wind speed and air flow you could say it will blow you across the room. The Air King has tremendous power, but it feels like overkill as a fan for home. It also has a three-pronged outlet, unlike our other fans. If you have an open space office or a garage that would benefit from powerful air circulation, this is a good option.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007Q3RHK/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/air-king.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Office: Air King</h3><p>The Air King pushed out the highest volume of air of the finalists. However, you'll have to be tolerate its high noise levels.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007Q3RHK/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>When you first start up the Air King, it makes a rattling sound and wobbles, but then it settles into a normal albeit loud whirring sound. For this reason, we did not choose the Air King for our top pick, despite its winning performance.</p>
<h3>GreenTech &#8211; PureFlow</h3>
<p>The aesthetic of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PS3FR1/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GreenTech</a> is ultra modern — in fact, with its sphere shape and shiny white casing, it looks more like a futuristic cartoon character (specifically, EVE from Disney’s WALL-E) than a traditional fan.</p>
<p>We can’t say enough about our comfort level with the bladeless design, and we felt it was safe enough to be in an area where young children are playing, without worrying they would attempt to stick their fingers through a grate and touch the blade.</p>
<p>The digital controls are easy to use, so you can figure them out without the use of the manual. The remote control is simple to use as well, and has a long range so it can be used from the other side of a large room.</p>
<p>The speeds range from 1 to 12. It’s not that powerful on its highest speed (at 10” across, it has a smaller face than the average 16 inches), but it circulates well, and you can feel the breeze from across the room. Despite the safety and usability of this fan, we didn’t feel it had enough wind speed to recommend it as our top pick.</p>
<p>What we loved about the digital controls on this fan is that it remembers the last setting you used, so if it was on speed 10 when you turned it off, it will be on speed 10 when you turn it on again.</p>
<h3>Rowenta &#8211; VU5551</h3>
<p>In its turbo-boost mode, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C4QP8N2/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rowenta<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></a>had strong wind speeds and was able to push a decent amount of air (just above average when compared with our other finalists). Unfortunately, with only mid-range power, it was the second loudest of the fans we tested. It advertises a top decibel rating of 57, although we recorded it at 68.1. The remote control and unit are easy to interface with, and the fan is easy to adjust.</p>
<p>The downsides to the Rowenta are that there is no on-board storage for the remote control and the front grill is extremely difficult to remove and reposition (making cleaning a chore). It also has a blue light that stays on all night. For these reasons, and the fact that it is slightly less powerful than our top picks, we didn’t name this our best pick.</p>
<h3>Vornado &#8211; Zippi</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000E19MQ8/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; Zippi</a> is definitely a conversation starter. Available in black, white or a variety of bright colors, the Zippi has a unique look. It is reminiscent of an airplane propeller, with three blades made of soft nylon fabric. The blades are safe to touch even when the fan is in motion. It weighs only 1.7 pounds (our lightest fan) and folds compact, making it an ideal travel companion.</p>
<p>It’s the quietest fan we tested, but it also had the lowest wind speed. We weren’t able to test the CFM due to the way the fan is constructed, although we did notice it is light on power. This took it out of the running for first place. Still, we think it’s pretty cute.</p>
<p>Some users have reported if you tilt it all the way back on the highest setting, it will flip over. We didn’t experience this issue, however.</p>
<h3>Honeywell &#8211; HT900 Turbo</h3>
<p>We can see why the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001R1RXUG/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honeywell</a> is a best seller on Amazon. It’s very basic, but it can pivot to a 90-degree angle and pushes out a large volume of air for its small stature. The Honeywell uses its proprietary Turbo Force Air Circular technology to achieve this effect. It’s one of the quietest fans we tested, so it’s great for a small bedroom.</p>
<p>It’s slightly big for a desktop fan but not enough air flow to place more than a few feet away from where you need it. This makes it a good fan, especially for the price, but prevented it from being labelled our number one.</p>
<p>Despite measuring at a loudness of only 64.6 decibels (close to our average decibel rating), the Best Choice makes clicking, popping and occasional grinding noises when in use. We also found the so-called “wind mode” to be a little disconcerting; it felt as if power were fading in and out, as if it were coming loose from the plug. Finally, the construction left something to be desired, and the LCD digital display never shuts off. For these reasons, we didn’t name the Best Choice as a top pick.</p>
<p>However, given its low price in comparison with the other pedestal fans, it may still be worth considering. If you just need a fan to get you through a brief period, the Best Choice is a decent fan in terms of circulation, breeze and ease of use.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>With any of our top choices, you can feel confident you’ll be purchasing a high-caliber product. They all have high wind speeds, push out a large volume of air and are constructed from durable, quality materials. The best choice for you when it comes to a fan depends on your personal preferences and budget.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TX79C1O/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vornado &#8211; VFAN Vintage</a> is a great choice for those who have a strong sense of style and want a fan that circulates air in a tornado air stream that reaches all corners of the room.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a pedestal fan that can be adjusted to direct a strong air stream to where you need, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYTD184/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klarstein &#8211; Silent Storm</a> is an excellent choice. It’s the most versatile fan we tested, with multiple modes and speeds. It can be set to a night-time mode that is ultra quiet and shuts off after a set amount of time, making it an ideal fan for the bedroom.</p>
<p>If budget is highest on your list of considerations, you’ll appreciate the relative low price of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BL7Z5S/?tag=ybdfan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesis &#8211; Avalon</a>. The Genesis is a steal, and you won’t have to sacrifice power.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>attresses seem to get all the love, but pillows can make or break a good night&#8217;s sleep. After testing six low- to mid-priced pillows that had popular and authenticated market approval, we found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8WVD7M/ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nest Bedding &#8211; Easy Breather</a> is the best cooling pillow for its shape, quality, pliability and lack of offensive odors. Some of our testers equated it to “sleeping on a cloud.&#8221; Our budget cooling-pillow pick is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758H3V9D/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Restoration &#8211; 1800 Series Gel Pillow</a>, which comes in packs of two and is a soft, moldable pillow that is versatile enough for any sleep position: side, back or stomach.</p>

<p>There are a lot of pillows on the market, and the descriptive terms given to many pillows can seem bewildering to a consumer. Adjectives like cooling, comforting, relaxing, breathable and “iso” do little to convey the actual performance or specific attributes of a pillow.</p>
<p>We dug through Reddit, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1/135-8935156-4169656?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=cooling+pillows" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> and consumer testing sites to cull a large list of available pillows on the market. We found that there are three pricing tiers for pillows that denote “cooling” benefits: These fall around $30-$40 at the lower range, $80-$100 at midrange and up to $150 at the very high range. Since very few of the pillows in the highest range had enough verifiable consumer reviews, we narrowed our focus on the low range, along with one pillow from the middle tier.</p>
<p>We further looked at which pillows were preferred for sleepers who identified themselves as back, stomach and side sleepers to ensure that we included the full range. For our four-person test group, we included sleepers who preferred at least one of these three positions for a significant portion of the night.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs-one">Who needs one?</h2>
<h3>Good pillows mean good sleep</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sleepfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Sleep Foundation</a> maintains a database of sleep habits and preferences throughout the U.S. and is an excellent resource for learning about the fundamentals of getting a good night’s sleep. In a recent National Sleep Foundation poll, 93% of respondents rated the quality of their pillow and mattress as being important to sleeping well.</p>
<p>In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1452037752/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Sleep for Success!</i></a>, Cornell University professor Dr. James Mass describes how sleep is an essential component for academic and physical performance. He notes that a lack of sleep correlates with many debilitating conditions, including depression, obesity, skin conditions, cancer and the lack of ability to think and perform well. So what’s the trick to a solid night’s sleep? A good <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-sleep-mask/" rel="noopener">sleep mask</a> or <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/best-white-noise-machine/" rel="noopener">white noise machine</a> can certainly help, but a more direct “head-on” approach is to find a comfortable pillow.</p>
<p>Few people take their preferred sleep position into account when purchasing a pillow. Relative to the expense of buying a new mattress, a pillow is a far less expensive alternative to rebooting a poor sleep experience. Signs that you may need to change your pillow include feeling overheated during the night and waking up feeling sore or stiff. Changing out your pillow is the first thing you should do to see if it helps you get uninterrupted sleep.</p>
<h3>Cool is better for sleeping</h3>
<p>Some of the tips on the National Sleep Foundation website are surprising. One that jumped out at us was that the ideal bedroom temperature for sleeping is between 60-70 °F, which seems quite a bit cooler than is customary. If staying cool is a major factor in getting good sleep, then having a pillow that keeps you cool seems like a sensible choice for most people.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pillow-squeeze-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<h3>Fill material</h3>
<p><b>Down:</b> Down is made from goose or duck feathers and is commonly found in high-end hotel pillows. It offers good neck support and durability. Two drawbacks for down are its relatively high cost and that many people are allergic to it.</p>
<p><b>Bamboo:</b> Bamboo is a natural plant fiber. It’s commonly found in pillows that are advertised as having cooling properties. Beware that many pillows that label themselves as bamboo actually use it only for the casing. Instead, they’re typically filled with shredded memory foam.</p>
<p><b>Memory foam:</b> Memory foam is a support material that is fairly economical and also hypoallergenic. It tends to retain heat and can be too stiff or too squishy for some people.</p>
<p><b>Latex:</b> Latex is a natural material that is good for neck pain and is easy to maintain. However, it is not moldable, has a short lifespan and tends to have an odor.</p>
<p><b>Down alternatives: </b>Down alternatives offer good head and neck support, are not derived from animals and are available at a lower price point than real down. However, synthetic down is less fluffy than regular down and requires more maintenance.</p>
<p><b>Buckwheat: </b>Buckwheat is a plant with grain-like seeds. This type of pillow allows air to circulate between the seeds. The seeds are actually the hulls (outer casings) of the seed pods. Because buckwheat pillows are filled with tiny individual seed hulls, the pillows can easily conform to the shape of an individual’s head and neck.</p>
<h3>Cooling gels</h3>
<p>Some pillows have gels running through the pillows in tubes or small pads. When you take the cover off a gel pillow, you can clearly see which face is the gel side. Other pillows incorporate gel into the fiber for the pillow filling itself.</p>
<h3>Cover material</h3>
<p>Most people use pillows with pillowcases, but some pillow covers are nice enough to use without a pillowcase as long as you wash them regularly. One thing to consider with cooling pillows is the way the pillow will be encased. A pillow will feel less cool if it is swaddled in a thick pillowcase or a decorative sham.</p>
<h3>Design based on sleep position</h3>
<p>Some pillows are designed for people who sleep in one particular position. Pillows with a deep indentation are designed for cervical support and are intended for people who experience chronic neck pain, as we discussed in our review of the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-neck-pain/">best pillow for neck pain</a>. Stomach sleepers will need a much shallower pillow than side sleepers since it is not desirable to have the spine pushed backward. If you sleep on your side, check out our review of the <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-pillow-for-side-sleepers/">best pillow for side sleepers</a>.</p>
<h3>Allergies</h3>
<p><b>Allergic sensitivities: </b>Down and latex can trigger allergies for many people, while bamboo is generally a hypoallergenic material.</p>
<p><b>Hypoallergenic: </b>The word “hypoallergenic” is not a scientific term, but a marketing term. Pillows do not actually block allergens, but certain materials, as noted above, are less likely to trigger allergies. For example, there are pillow covers that have pores so small that they block dust mites and other allergens from seeping through.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> You can get a good pillow for anywhere between $30 and $150, and when good pillows go on sale, there are bargains to be had. Based on our testing group and a review of other consumer testing sites, there are many high-quality pillows to choose from in the $40 range.</p>
<h3>Certipur certification</h3>
<p><a href="https://certipur.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certipur</a> is a nonprofit organization that tests bedding for the presence of toxins, including ozone, flame retardants, heavy metals, formaldehyde, phthalates and VOCs (volatile organic compounds). The evaluation committee is composed of scientists, academics, environmentalists and consumer advocates. A Certipur certification, in the form of a tag attached to a pillow, is evidence that none of the tested toxins are present.</p>
<h3>Pillowcase</h3>
<p>Any pillow’s comfort and performance will be affected by the type of pillowcase you use. For cooling pillows, heavier pillowcases and shams can negate any cooling or circulation benefit that the pillow has. Most cooling pillow manufacturers recommend you use a waterproof, breathable pillowcase with their products.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pillow-washing-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>The same technology and fabrics that are found in mattresses are also found in pillows. So in researching the best cooling pillows, it is necessary to cut through a lot of marketing hyperbole to determine what exactly goes into that thing you rest your head on every night.</p>
<p>Whether you are a side, back or stomach sleeper, a good pillow can mean the difference between a great night of sleep and a sweaty, restless struggle to get comfy. The market is flooded with pillows that promise a cool night’s sleep, and the price points vary a lot depending on materials and quality. Some pillows take it a step further and are tailored to sleep style: side (most common), stomach or back.</p>
<p>We focused on pillows that emphasized cooling properties. Actual cooling cannot be imparted by fabric, but the sensation of cooling can be experienced by promoting air circulation or from water. Water imparts a cooling sensation when it evaporates from the skin. Fabrics from companies like Techniche and its <a href="http://www.techniche-intl.com/products/technologies/hyperkewl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperkewl</a> line are soaked in water, which is released gradually during exertion.</p>
<p>One of our tested pillows, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZK5UT6/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Better &#8211; Iso-Cool</a>, uses microscopic beads made from Phase Change Material (PCM) that is purported to have both cooling and heating capabilities. Its manufacturer, Carpenter Co., claims that the material — branded “Outlast Adaptive Comfort” — can adjust to a body’s changing temperature throughout the night.</p>
<p>A panel of three adults and one 12-year-old participated in our qualitative sleep test. The panel consisted of one dedicated side sleeper, one sleeper who uses all three positions (side, back and stomach), one sleeper who primarily side sleeps, and one sleeper who primarily back sleeps.</p>
<h3>Primary test criteria</h3>
<p>To ensure a level playing field in terms of pillow covers, we used a thin, waterproof cover made by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071P8Q3FD/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mastertex</a>. Our four testers were given all six pillows to use for two nights each, and they were asked to evaluate the pillows based on the following categories.</p>
<p><b>Texture:</b> Texture relates to the feel and tactile properties of the exterior of the pillow (whether it is rough, smooth or in-between), along with how easy it is to feel the filling through the pillow cover. In the world of cooling pillows, there are two prevalent fillings: shredded memory foam and gel-type fillings. For the latter, the pillow can use actual gel or gel fibers.</p>
<p><b>Ability to conform:</b> This is a big determinant of pillow comfort. Some people want a very firm pillow that supports the entire weight of their head, while others want a pillow that can only be described as “squishy” and conforms around their head. Many people also want to make slight adjustments to their pillow to support their neck or chin.</p>
<p><b>Coolness:</b> All of our testers spent several nights with each pillow. Then we asked them questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the pillow feel cool when you first lay down on it?</li>
<li>If you woke up during the night, did you feel that the pillow was warm, cool or in-between?</li>
<li>Did you feel that the pillow helped you sleep through the night because of its cooling properties?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other test criteria</h3>
<p><b>Support:</b> Support relates to the overall sense of how the pillow props up the head and neck. We measured the resting and compressed height of each pillow, along with each pillow’s width and length. Our testing corroborated other tests in that side sleepers prefer a pillow with more depth than stomach or back sleepers.</p>
<p><b>Firmness:</b> We compressed our pillows under a 10-pound weight to see how firm they were. The more they flattened, the less firm the pillows were. We found that the firmest pillows were best for propping ourselves up and reading in bed. Check out our <a href="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/reviews/the-best-book-light/">review of the best book light</a> here.</p>
<p><b>Odor:</b> There is a variety of natural and synthetic fabrics that go into pillows, and some of them have quite a pronounced odor. We lived long enough with our test pillows to determine which ones, if any, retained their initial odors and caused off-gassing.</p>
<p><b>Compression</b>: For the compression test, we used a 10-pound barbell resting on a wooden board to apply even pressure on each pillow.</p>
<p>We then tallied the pre-compressed height of the pillow and the height after compression. This gave us a sense of how much each pillow would compress when a person sleeps on it.</p>
<p><b>Heat retention</b>: In order to get a sense of whether a pillow retained heat, we tested with a heating pad applied for three minutes. We took the temperature of the pillow before (baseline temperature) and after applying the heating pad. Then we recorded how long it took for the pillow to return to its original “resting” temperature.</p>
<p><b>Cleanability: </b>Finally, we evaluated how easy it was to clean the pillows and whether it was possible to wash both the cover and the pillow itself. Cleaning pillows thoroughly entail three steps: (1) airing them out in the sun, (2) putting them in the washing machine, and (3) drying them with towels to expedite the drying process. To maintain fluffiness, putting tennis balls in the dryer bin helps.</p>
<p>Manufacturers are quick to note that pillows are hypoallergenic and resistant to dust mites, but all still pillows need to be cleaned to ensure that they perform as advertised for their useful life.</p>
<p>A few of our test pillows, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BO6S58/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perfect Cloud &#8211; Double Airflow</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072HFY7WZ/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Ultra-Luxury</a> and its twin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V909F1K/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtreme Comforts &#8211; Kool-Flow Adjustable</a>, have a removable cover that can be washed separately from the pillow itself.</p>

<p>Our overall pick for the best cooling pillow is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8WVD7M/ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nest Bedding &#8211; Easy Breather</a>. Chosen in part because using it was described like “sleeping on a cloud,” the Nest is light but firm to the touch. It provides a supportive but somewhat moldable form for side breathers and is compressible enough to appeal to back and stomach sleepers as well. Another nice thing about the Nest is that it did not come with any offensive off-gassing odors.</p>
<p>Our testing team’s consensus is that the Nest fills the sweet spot between support and comfort. Why? Well, for one thing, the Nest is unusual in that it is adjustable. The Tencel cover has a small zipper that can be opened to remove some of the pillow’s memory foam fill to create a custom height. We experimented with this and found that it worked perfectly. All it took was a bit of smoothing out to reduce the height of the Nest.</p>
<p>The pillow innards are made from shredded synthetic foam, and the cover is a combination of plant-derived lyocell and polyester. The Certipur-certified foam filling is made without ozone-depleting materials, flame retardants, mercury or lead, all of which can sometimes be found in other synthetic foam products.</p>

We found it remains comfortable through the night, especially for side sleepers.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8WVD7M/ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Nest scored particularly well for its overall feeling of luxury. Unlike a few of our other pillows, the Nest had no discernible odor. Although it was among the tallest pillows we tested before and after our compression test, the Nest molded nicely to our testers’ heads.</p>
<p>Our testers also thought the Nest felt cool throughout the night, and it returned to its baseline temperature in the midrange of our test group standings. And while the Nest is more expensive than some of our other tested models, its cover feels quite durable, which likely extends its lifespan and justifies the additional cost.</p>
<p>The Nest offers a lifetime warranty that covers the fill, cover and zipper. If the fill sags by an inch or more, if the zipper fails or if there are physical flaws relating to the cover itself, Nest will repair or replace the pillow.</p>
<p>If we had to pick one thing that we did not like about the Nest, it’s that the cover unzips only a little bit to remove the filling for adjustment, and the only way to clean the cover is to remove the filling entirely. For a relatively expensive pillow, we think that the cover should be designed so that it can be cleaned separately without so much hassle.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Nest Bedding &#8211; Easy Breather scored high for feeling luxurious, moldable and not having any odor.</li>
<li>It tied for tallest pillow before and after our compression test.</li>
<li>It falls in the midrange for heat retention, returning to its baseline temperature in just under one-and-a-half minutes.</li>
<li>The pillow feels cool throughout the night and doesn’t sag or require adjustment.</li>
<li>For support and comfort, the Nest hits a sweet spot by offering a nice balance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gel pillows incorporate liquid that creates an evaporative effect, which in turn promotes air circulation and a consequent cooling effect. The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758H3V9D/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20">Sleep Restoration &#8211; 1800 Series Gusseted Gel Pillow</a> is made with a filling composed of 100% gel fiber. The gel fiber delivered one of the lowest baseline temperatures of all the pillows we tested, coming in at 74 degrees.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758H3V9D/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-150x150.png 150w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-425x425.png 425w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-295x295.png 295w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-360x360.png 360w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-375x375.png 375w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-414x414.png 414w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration-320x320.png 320w, https://ybdstatic.chrissmearing.now.sh/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sleep-restoration.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Budget Pick: Sleep Restoration - 1800 Series Gel</h3><p>For a comfortable, affordable pillow that can accommodate a range of sleep position preferences, we like the Sleep Restoration pillow. It felt plush from the moment our heads hit the pillow.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758H3V9D/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Gel fiber is made to feel like down and offers a plush material that feels luxurious when your head rests on it. Of all our pillows, the Sleep Restoration felt the most comfortable right away. The gel fiber makes for an extremely smooth feeling pillow. Our testers found the pillow to be the plushest in our test group, with one tester calling it “super plush.”</p>
<p>Although the pillow is noted by its manufacturer as being stain resistant, we observed that it picked up smudges pretty quickly. It is also noted as being chemical-free, but this seems like a dubious claim based on the fact that its gel fibers are a manufactured synthetic material.</p>
<p>While the pillow is sealed, it is also breathable and easy to wash by putting the entire pillow in the washing machine. We machine washed the pillow on our EcoWarm cycle and put it in the dryer for 30 minutes, followed by another hour in the sun. Cleaning was fairly hassle-free.</p>
<p>The Sleep Restoration seems like a simple pillow at first, but it provides excellent, comfortable support and is the best option for stomach and back sleepers who need less height from their pillow. The compressed depth for this pillow measured 3-3/8 inches, the lowest in our testing group.</p>
<p>One potential pitfall with the Sleep Restoration is that a number of Amazon reviewers noted that their pillows arrived with mold spots. While these represent a small minority of the nearly 5,000 product reviews, it is something to be aware of.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The gel fiber filling in the Sleep Restoration &#8211; 1800 Series Gusseted Gel Pillow feels luxurious and seems the closest to pillows found in nice hotels.</li>
<li>The pillow does not have a removable cover but can put in a washing machine.</li>
<li>The Sleep Restoration has a low height, which tends to be most comfortable for back and stomach sleepers.</li>
<li>On the downside, in our heat test the Sleep Restoration measured the warmest and took the second longest to return to its baseline temperature.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sleep Better &#8211; Iso-Cool Traditional</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZK5UT6/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Better &#8211; Iso-Cool Traditional</a> was the Mercedes Benz of our test group; nice but perhaps a bit overbuilt. None of our testers thought that it was moldable, and some of them thought it was a bit undersized. It did seem to keep cool during the night, and it has a supportive shredded memory foam filling.</p>
<p>The Sleep Better touts its Phase Change Material (PCM) with the brand name “Outlast Adaptive Comfort” that senses changing body temperature. The material is comprised of microscopic beads that are alleged to absorb heat when it senses that the body is too warm, and to perform in the reverse when the body is too cool. The Sleep Better was the least tall of all our pillows, but our testers downgraded it for not feeling especially luxurious.</p>
<p>In appearance, the Sleep Better had the smallest overall dimensions. Its resting depth was five inches, and its compressed depth was three inches. As expected, it rated relatively high with our back and stomach sleepers. But one sleeper who is a part-time stomach sleeper noted that, despite its relatively small size, it was not moldable enough for her liking.</p>
<p>In terms of temperature, the Sleep Better was the poorest performer, taking over two minutes to return to its baseline temperature. Overall, the testers noted its temperature as average for the group.</p>
<h3>Perfect Cloud &#8211; Double Airflow</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012BO6S58/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perfect Cloud &#8211; Double Airflow</a> is a nicely made pillow; it’s also one of our only finalists that has a fully removable cover that can be washed separately. This pillow is entirely synthetic with a 97% polyester cover and a filling made from 100% polyurethane foam. For at least one of our testers, this pillow struck a perfect balance between comfort and support.</p>
<p>The Perfect Cloud would have scored higher in our overall ratings if it was suitable for cleaning in the washing machine. The instructions recommend spot cleaning only, which seems odd considering the cover is easily removable. In overall design and sense of quality, the Perfect Cloud resembles our top-pick Nest pillow; and despite being almost an inch less in depth, it compressed to the same height when our 10-pound weight was applied.</p>

<h3>Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Ultra-Luxury</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B072HFY7WZ/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snuggle-Pedic &#8211; Ultra-Luxury Pillow</a> has over 10,000 Amazon reviews that average 4.5/5. It is billed as an “ultra-luxury” pillow and is made with shredded memory foam filling combined with a bamboo cover. It was tied for being the tallest pillow at 6-1/2 inches. It did not perform all that well in our heat retention test, taking nearly a one-and-a-half minutes to return to its baseline temperature. Most of our review panel also agreed the Snuggle-Pedic was not very moldable.</p>
<p>The Snuggle-Pedic was one of our “double-identity” pillows — exactly the same as our Xtreme Comforts pillow. Both pillows had a sour odor that did not completely dissipate even after several days. On the upside, the Snuggle-Pedic cover can be taken off to wash separately.</p>
<h3>Xtreme Comforts &#8211; Kool-Flow Adjustable</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V909F1K/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtreme Comforts &#8211; Kool-Flow Adjustable Thickness Pillow</a> is identical to the Snuggle-Pedic except for the labeling. Although the bamboo cover and memory foam materials of the pillow are exactly the same, the two pillows appear to be more fraternal than identical twins: The Xtreme comforts pillow was not quite as tall and performed a tad better in our heat retention test.</p>
<p>Our stomach and back sleepers noted that both of these pillows seemed too high and not suited to any position except side sleeping.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>For an overall outstanding pillow that exudes quality and combines a high level of finish, support and comfort, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8WVD7M/ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nest Bedding &#8211; Easy Breather</a> is our pick for the best overall cooling pillow. Along with the Perfect Cloud, the Nest exuded quality, especially in its brocaded cover. One thing to note is that the cover unzips only part way and is not intended to be removed and washed.</p>
<p>After testing our pillows, we concurred with the saying that there is no “best pillow” but rather a “best pillow for you.” Within our test group, there was a lot of discrepancy among reviewers. For example, with the Perfect Cloud’s pillow, there was one reviewer who rated it as their favorite and another who rated it their least favorite.</p>
<p>We were surprised to find that two of our pillows were exactly the same but branded differently: the Snuggle-Pedic and Xtreme Comforts. When shopping, it’s prudent to look at the exact specifications, including the measurements and materials, to make sure that you know what you are getting.</p>
<p>For an outstanding budget pick, we like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0758H3V9D/?tag=ybdcoolpillow-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleep Restoration &#8211; 1800 Series Gusseted Gel</a> product. Two pillows come in each package, which is generally available for about $70. The Sleep Restoration pillows are similar to hotel pillows — smooth, plush and pleasantly cool throughout the night.</p>
