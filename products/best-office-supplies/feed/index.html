								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Picture this: Your morning routine without a commute. No traffic, no shoulder bumping and no pseudo breakfasts as you’re rushing out the door.</p>
<p>With the rise of working from home in the U.S., this scenario is not uncommon anymore. The demand for flexible working environments and advancement in technology has encouraged companies to offer employees the option to work from home.</p>
<p>In fact, according to a <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-and-geography-changes/2017/1-year.html#par_textimage_0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study released by the U.S. Census</a>, 5.2% of workers in the U.S. worked from home full time in 2017, a 3.3% increase since 2000. To put that in perspective, that’s 3.7 million people working from home in 2000, increased to 6.5 million.</p>
<h2>The big picture: work from home statistics</h2>
<p>Before breaking down how working remotely has affected the workforce for both employers and employees, let’s take a look at some of the highlights around working from home.</p>

<h2>How does remote work influence productivity?</h2>
<p>Old thinking believes that employees must be in the office to be productive, but this mentality disregards the distractions that an office environment comes with. Socializing, unnecessarily long meetings and loud colleagues can slow down a productive employee.</p>
<p>Fewer distractions allow for workers to focus on the task at hand, often completing it quicker than if they were sitting in a cubicle. In <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/flexjobs-2018-annual-survey-workers-believe-flexible-remote-job-can-help-save-money-reduce-stress-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlexJobs’ 2018 annual survey on telecommuting</a>, they uncovered that the top reasons why people believe they are more productive while working remotely: fewer <a href="https://www.calendar.com/blog/work-from-home-top-10-distractions-you-should-know/">distractions</a> and interruptions, reduced stress from commuting, minimal office politics and a quieter noise level.</p>
<p>Although statistics show that productivity goes up for employees with flexible work options, the <a href="https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/remote-workers-feel-guilty-.aspx?_ga=1.12615223.1213129156.1471284607" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)</a> reported that 62% of remote workers say they’re afraid that their onsite colleagues don&#8217;t think they are working as hard as them.</p>
<p>Regardless, results from numerous studies looking into employees who work from home don’t lie. Let’s take a look at more working from home statistics related to productivity.</p>

<h2>Do remote workers need to compromise on their income?</h2>
<p>While some companies may not see the same value of an in-office employee as a remote employee, resulting in pay cuts, this trade-off is not always the case dependent on the skillset and career path of the employee. In a study by <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow</a>, they found that developers who work remotely can earn as much as 40% more than developers working in an office.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/companies-set-salaries-remote-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlexJobs also did some digging</a>, asking recruiters if pay for remote employees is different than for in-office employees for the same role, and their answer was a resounding: no.</p>
<blockquote class="ybd-featured-quote"><div class="ybd-featured-quote-inner"><p>There’s absolutely no difference. Whether you’re in-office or remote, total compensation is based on the position as well as performance.</p><footer class="ybd-featured-quote-footer"><cite>&mdash; Shannon at PricewaterhouseCoopers</cite></footer></div></blockquote>
<p>Sound promising for remote employees?</p>
<p>Yes, but Payscale, Glassdoor and Ziprecruiter tells us that it’s industry dependent. In the end, recruiters say that negotiating is key. While remote employees might feel pressured to accept a lower salary due to the flexibility, progressive companies are more apt to compensate based on skills, not on location.</p>
<h2>How does remote work affect retention rates?</h2>
<p>Stephane Kasriel, the CEO of Upwork, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/blog/2018/03/future-workforce-report-remote-work-mainstream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once said</a> “Companies that refuse to support a remote workforce risk losing their best people and turning away tomorrow’s top talent.”</p>
<p>Kasriel has a point. In <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/flexjobs-2018-annual-survey-workers-believe-flexible-remote-job-can-help-save-money-reduce-stress-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlexJobs’ 2018 Annual Survey</a>, they found that 76% of respondents said that they would be more loyal to their employers if they had flexible work options.<br />
Millennial job seekers have said that they <a href="https://www.adp.com/spark/articles/2018/10/workplace-flexibility-for-millennials-appealing-to-a-valuable-new-generation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weigh flexible work options heavily</a> when it comes to finding a new employer, but flexibility isn’t only desired for the sake of work-life balance. Working from home allows employees to relocate, whatever the circumstances may be, without needing to seek out a new job.</p>
<p>Additionally, given that employers who offer remote work don’t need to recruit in one particular city, the quality of applicants can be much higher. That gives employers the option to be picky, and only hire those who are interested in being a part of the company for the long haul. Therefore, retention rates are typically higher for these companies.<br />
We pulled more statistics that showcase how remote work affects retention rates.</p>

<h2>What does working from home do for work-life balance?</h2>
<p>While some employers have introduced ping pong tables, beer on tap and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-bean-bag-chair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bean bag chairs</a> to boost employee morale, it’s just not cutting it. Work-life balance has been the talk of the recruitment and HR community for years, but millennials are defining it differently these days.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-23177 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/success-quote-2.png" alt="" width="1621" height="689" /></p>
<p>Work-life balance and working from home go hand in hand. By encouraging the ability for employees to work remote, it supports employees outside of work. Whether it be to spend more time with their families versus sitting in traffic, or fulfill their travel bucket list, remote work has been proven to promote a work-life balance.</p>

<h2>How does working remote impact stress levels?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/PGi/state-of-telecommuting-2014-pgi-report/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Premiere Global Services, Inc. (PGi) reported</a> that 82% of their telecommuters reported lower stress levels. But let’s face it, some remote workers might be hesitant to admit to their boss that they’re stressed for fear of being requested back into the office.</p>
<p>Does that mean that working remote could help lower stress related to work?</p>
<p>We took a look at what causes stress in the workplace and found that an employee’s personality traits can affect their stress level when working remote.</p>
<p>The obvious reasons why working from home can reduce stress are: no commute, comfortable clothing, personalized office space and more. But, there are ways that remote work could increase stress based off of each employees’ personality.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Minimal socializing</b>. Some employees thrive with human interaction. It’s easy for remote workers to feel a sense of loneliness, especially if they consider themselves an extrovert.</li>
<li><b>Working long hours</b>. If you’re working from home, it can be difficult to step away and can’t see the office clearing out at the end of the day. Long hours can lead to stress, and ultimately, burnout.</li>
<li><b>Stress goes unnoticed</b>. If you’re in an office, your manager or colleagues will likely be able to tell that you are stressed based off of your physical appearance, attitude or behaviour. And, if you have a supportive employer, they’ll work towards helping change that. Remote workers must speak up if they’re feeling stressed since they aren’t face-to-face with their manager, therefore, the signs of stress could go unnoticed and be elongated. This could result in higher stress levels than if they were in the office.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those who are working from home and feeling stressed, it can be first combated by recognizing it. Then, work towards creating a routine, defining boundaries, taking breaks, creating a new work environment or working on other ways to socialize during the work week.</p>
<h2>Lower overhead for everyone: employer and employee</h2>
<p>Operating costs such as real estate and overhead can come with a hefty price tag for employers. According to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-much-your-company-pays-to-rent-office-space-2015-05-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MarketWatch</a>, the average office space per employee costs $14,800 in New York, $6,702 in Los Angeles and $6,080 in Boston annually. No matter what city a company is based out of, office space will always cost more than no office space at all.</p>
<p>In the same vein, employees can save on costs when they work from home. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/citi-thankyou-premier-commuter-index-reveals-us-consumers-spend-an-average-of-2600-per-year-on-their-commute-300095179.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some experts</a> say that it costs upwards of $2,600 on average per year for Americans to commute to work. Studies show that telecommuting saves on costs for both the employer and the employee.</p>

<h2>The environmental impact for those who work from home</h2>
<p>According to data from <a href="https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Workplace Analytics</a>, if everyone whose jobs are compatible with remote work telecommuted half the time, they’d eliminate 119 billion miles of highway driving each year. It would also reduce the amount of oil we use by 640 million barrels and cut emissions by 54 million tons of greenhouse gas.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right. Not only does working from home lower oil consumption, but it reduces the need for road repair and parking.</p>
<p>Working remote also reduces printing since everything is shared digitally, so waste is reduced significantly at home than in offices. As a result of our digging into the environmental impact of working from home, we uncovered these surprising facts.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Backpacks for carrying laptops are everywhere, and there are tens of thousands of designs to pick from. The essential features are pretty obvious: A laptop backpack has to carry your laptop and other daily essentials in a comfortable and secure way, but should also give you easy access when you need your most frequently-used items.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re gear enthusiasts at Your Best Digs, with a team that&#8217;s mostly made up of remote contributors. We all have bags we love, and most of us have owned bags we loathed.</p>
<p>After writing down a list of features that we consider absolutely essential, we started our research by collecting data about what influences the preferences of backpack buyers. We polled the gear nerds in the office and the digital nomads on our remote teams about the qualities they consider essential to a perfect laptop bag.</p>
<p>Access to a laptop and the accessories that come with it were (predictably) top of the list, but the other priorities were split. When we broke down our results into groups of people with different budgets, the preferences were more consistent.</p>
<p><strong>It was pretty clear that the more you spend, the more important the aesthetic of a backpack becomes.</strong> Those willing to spend big bucks on a backpack also prioritized waterproofing.</p>
<p>Of our survey-takers who didn&#8217;t want to spend as much money on a backpack, the biggest priority was functionality. Features like sunglasses pockets and bags that don&#8217;t fall over started filtering to the top in this group.</p>
<p>Our lead researcher for this review has owned a Tom Binh bag for a decade, and he spent some time searching the Tom Binh official forums for opinions about what makes a particular bag best for certain scenarios. (People on the Tom Binh forums like to talk about bags a lot.)</p>
<p>We considered all the recommendations from websites that actually tested for specific qualities, like Outdoor Gear Lab, as well as sites that focused on summarizing the strengths of different bags, like PackHacker, TheBrokeBackpacker and Wirecutter.</p>
<p>We took the priorities from our research and started searching retailers for high-quality backpacks with essential features and good design. We also checked out budget-friendly bags with high review counts and good overall scores from people who had purchased them.</p>
<p>We scoured subreddits like r/bifl, r/onebag and r/digitalnomad for recommendations from people who aren&#8217;t paid to review bags, and we also spent a long time watching YouTube reviews, mostly from the travel-focused &#8220;one bag&#8221; minimalism crowd.</p>
<p>We also spent some time away from computer screens and looked at bags in person at local retailers like REI and Best Buy. We&#8217;re happy we did, because we would have missed all our top picks if we had only looked at Amazon.</p>
<p>After we put together a list of 30 top-rated backpacks that fit our criteria, we had to cull the herd to a short list that really hit our core priorities. <strong>We found six bags with all the essential features plus some key perks that made them stand out.</strong></p>
<p>We decided to test bags that were mostly in the $50–$100 price range. We did test one $130 bag, however, to see if our testers noticed the difference high-end materials can make.</p>
<p>We skipped the really cheap bags we researched after reading too many accounts of bad zippers, bad stitching and uncomfortable straps. If you just want something cheap that will carry a laptop, you can use nearly any backpack and even get decent protection with a padded sleeve.</p>
<h3>What about premium bags?</h3>
<p>We like a lot of bags in the $200-and-up price range that we didn&#8217;t test. From the nine premium bags we researched in-depth, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EH3CM4C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Incase &#8211; Icon</a>, the <a href="https://blackember.com/pages/waterproof-urban-backpacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Ember &#8211; Citadel</a>, the <a href="https://www.tombihn.com/collections/laptop-bags/products/synapse-25?variant=7593508110399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Binh &#8211; Synapse</a> and the <a href="https://www.goruck.com/rucksacks/compare-rucksacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoRuck &#8211; GR1</a> came the closest to making the grade.</p>
<p>When we talked to our friends and coworkers about expensive bags, they all had very different ideas about what they wanted. Some people want a leather briefcase that will make a good impression at business meetings, while others want a pack with adjustable suspension for comfortable all-day trail use.</p>
<p>We decided not to try picking just one or two of these &#8220;ultimate upgrade&#8221; bags to test, but we hope that the testing we did with less expensive bags can help you find out about the features that make a great bag.</p>

<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Internal capacity:</b> Typically listed in liters, this is a measurement of how much space a pack has to hold bulky items. A 20-liter backpack is just big enough for a laptop and a few books, 25 liters gives you room to stash a sweater, and a 35-liter bag can usually replace a carry-on suitcase for weekend trips.</p>
<p><b>Fall protection: </b>There are three ways a good backpack can keep your computer safe from falls. First, the laptop pouch can be sewn so that its bottom is higher than the bottom of the bag. Second, the pocket can include foam padding to absorb shock and pressure. Finally, a pouch that holds your laptop tightly means there&#8217;s less room for it to knock around inside when your bag is bumped.</p>
<p><b>Fabric weight:</b> Fabrics are graded by weight in &#8220;deniers,&#8221; and 1000-denier nylon yarn is the extra-rugged stuff woven into the canvas-like materials used for suitcases and outdoor gear. The 500-denier yarn most bag manufacturers use is still resistant to abrasion and rips, but it&#8217;s significantly lighter and more supple. As saving weight becomes even more important, manufacturers are more likely to use thin 200-denier fabric in a &#8220;ripstop&#8221; weave that won&#8217;t fall apart if you get a hole.</p>

<p><b>Fabric type:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Nylon</b> is the gold standard for a tough, light-weight polymer that resists wear, heat and stains. The main downside to nylon is that it absorbs water, which makes it more difficult to dye and can lead to soggy-feeling fabric if you&#8217;re caught in the rain.</li>
<li><b>Polyester</b> is sometimes substituted to allow colors or textures that aren&#8217;t possible with nylon. It&#8217;s not as tough as nylon, but it&#8217;s very slightly more heat resistant and the fabric itself won&#8217;t get soggy.</li>
<li><b>Dyneema, Spectra and Kevlar</b> are extra-tough filaments (like fishing line) that are sometimes woven into the ripstop pattern of lightweight nylon to make it stronger.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Waterproof treatments: </b>Most fabric used in bags is given at least a quick spray with a durable water repellent (&#8220;DWR&#8221;) treatment. This coating will keep water in droplets and help it roll off your bag instead of soaking in. If your bag is sitting in the water or puddles form on the top of the bag, you need a fabric with a heavier waterproof backing and sealed seams to keep your gear dry.</p>
<p><b>Specialized pockets:</b> We looked specifically for bags that had some way to carry a water bottle or travel mug in an easy-to-reach place while you&#8217;re wearing it. Glasses don&#8217;t demand as much specific space, but a convenient pocket that will protect them from scratches is a nice bonus.</p>

<p><b>TSA checkpoint-friendly features:</b> Since 2008, the Transportation Safety Agency has had <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/releases/2008/08/15/checkpoint-friendly-laptop-bag-procedures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a specific set of rules</a> that allows you to keep your laptop inside some kinds of bags while clearing security checkpoints. Bags that meet these guidelines have a fold-out laptop sleeve or pouch that gives an unobstructed view of the laptop to the X-ray machine. The advantage is that you don&#8217;t need to pull your laptop out and put it in a bin, but sometimes these bags are actually less convenient for everyday laptop use.</p>
<p><b>Anti-theft features:</b> The most common and functional security feature we saw is a set of rings on some bags&#8217; zippers that lets you lock them together with a small padlock. Other features like embedded cut-proof steel mesh tend to add a lot of bulk and weight, so we discounted bags that included them.</p>
<p><b>Sternum and waist straps:</b> Even the best shoulder straps can only do so much for keeping a heavy load balanced and in place. A connecting strap across your chest or an extra strap around your waist will keep a backpack from slipping, shifting and flopping, which is especially important if you&#8217;re on a bike or running to catch a bus.</p>
<p><b>Ventilated back panels: </b>All of the backpacks we tested feature some kind of sweat-wicking material or ventilation-friendly sculpting to keep your back cool and comfortable on long, hot days.</p>

<p><strong>We gave our six top bags to four testers, each with their own personal taste and set of needs.</strong> Two of our digital nomads are remote-working editors for Your Best Digs, and they rely on an Ogio backpack and a Tom Binh messenger bag, respectively.</p>
<p>One tester is a regional account manager who carries his laptop in a Timbuk2 backpack to different cities every week, and he gave us some perspective on the suitability of bags for air travel and on-the-road organization.</p>
<p>Our last tester is a biomechanical engineering PhD candidate who carries her laptop all over the University of California Irvine campus every day. She normally uses a North Face &#8211; Recon backpack, and she&#8217;s an avid hiker, so she provided some insight into the way laptop-focused bags compare to trail gear.</p>
<p>Our testers took these bags on planes, trains and motorcycles. We carried laptops ranging from 12-inch ultralights to full-size 15-inch models. We loaded each bag with our everyday complement of things like chargers, headphones, books, water bottles and lunches.</p>
<h3>Fit for different laptop sizes</h3>
[table id=257 /]
<p>While the average laptop is thinner and lighter than anything we could imagine a few decades ago, those of us with big desktop-replacement machines need their bags to be just as supportive and protective as ever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as simple as saying that a bigger backpack will be better for more people, though. Our testers with slim or compact laptops felt much happier when using bags that kept their computers from flopping around.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ESKY9FU/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Swissgear &#8211; 1900</a> has, technically speaking, the biggest laptop pocket. That pocket is really a full-size section of the backpack, though, and it only has a velcro strap to keep a laptop from flopping around. If you keep your laptop in a neoprene sleeve and value the checkpoint-friendly design that might be totally fine, but most of us worried about how much our machines clunked around in the Swissgear bag.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI &#8211; Ruckpack</a> had the opposite problem: While this slim and utilitarian bag will technically hold a 15-inch MacBook Pro, such a wide laptop will push out on the Ruckpack&#8217;s side pockets and make the bag much less usable than it should be.</p>
<h3>Comfort and stability</h3>
<p>After carrying laptops, lunches and other day-to-day loads for four weeks, our lead tester tried wearing each pack with 20 lbs of weight inside for ten minutes at a time while working at his desk and walking around the block. By the time he circled back to his first pack for a second try, it was clear which designs were actually comfortable under a bigger load.</p>
<p>The trail-born pedigree of The North Face &#8211; Mainframe and Mystery Ranch &#8211; Rip Ruck made them easy choices for comfort. The surprise was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play</a> pack, which was still surprisingly comfortable with a full load.</p>
<h3>Waterproofing</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/waterproof.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Our team is fortunate enough to live in a climate without much unexpected rain, so none of our testers had to use these bags in a real downpour.</p>
<p>But we did test for waterproofing anyhow. We put a paper towel into each of the pockets and compartments of the six bags and then thoroughly drenched them with the soaker head from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose-nozzle/">garden hose nozzle review</a>. Next, we blew the remaining water off the bags with a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">leaf blower</a> to simulate the worst conditions for waterproofing, like cycling in the rain.</p>
<p><strong>All of the bags have some kind of water repellent coating to help shed water.</strong> If you just get caught in a quick downpour while you&#8217;re walking to your car, you probably won&#8217;t have to worry about any of these bags letting water in.</p>
<p>Under a sustained downpour, though, most bags will let you down. Only <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> was able to keep any water from seeping in, undoubtedly because it features a flap that covers the main zipper and backing trim behind the other zips.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129538%2Fmystery-ranch-rip-ruck-sack-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mystery Ranch &#8211; Rip Ruck</a> is a close second in this category, with its beefy water-resistant YKK Aquaguard zipper that has a polyurethane coating to minimize leaks. We still saw some drips seep through under the full blast of our test downpour, but the fabric on the Rip Ruck absorbed less water overall and dried out more quickly than the Mainframe.</p>

<p>Our testers all preferred the look, feel and features of <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> mid-size laptop backpack. With 24 liters of storage capacity but only one main compartment, this bag strikes a great compromise between carrying enough gear and keeping a sleek, minimalist profile.</p>
<p>The North Face is a top manufacturer of sporting goods, with a devoted following among those who use their gear on the trail and those who just want to look like they do. The Mainframe is based on many of the best features of the big <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LFE73T0/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">30-liter Surge travel pack</a>, cut down to the size of smaller daypacks like the Recon and Jester. The Mainframe has only one main compartment and a clean, no-nonsense set of accessory pockets.</p>

<p>Despite being a bag designed for sale at Best Buy exclusively, The North Face didn&#8217;t cut any corners with the build quality. The Mainframe uses heavy YKK coil zips with cast metal pulls all over. The fabric used is mostly 210-denier ripstop Cordura nylon, with a heavier Oxford-weave polyester-nylon bottom panel to help with long-term wear.</p>
<p><strong>This was easily the most-loved style among our testers, too.</strong> The outside zips, loops and straps are just enough to indicate a serious piece of gear without making you look like you got lost on your way to a campsite. Best Buy only buys this in gray, but the fabric has a nice texture and pattern that goes with basically everything.</p>

The style, comfort and versatility made this a winner with each of our testers.</p><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank"><button>See Price at BestBuy.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The waterproofing on the Mainframe, as mentioned above, is excellent. Water won&#8217;t get in through the flap-covered zippers, even after a thorough soak and a blast of wind. It&#8217;s not a dry bag, though: The Nylon fabric will soak up water if you leave it sitting in the bottom of a kayak. If you do get caught in a downpour, make sure to empty the bag, and let the fabric dry out.</p>
<h3>Not as good for 17-inch laptops</h3>
<p>While the Mainframe is technically just big enough to hold the old 17-inch 2011 MacBook Pro (which is 10.51 inches wide and just under an inch thick), it&#8217;s not going to help you with a massive gaming laptop. For example, the new 17-inch chassis from Clevo (customized and re-packaged by specialty brands like Sager and Falcon Northwest) fills up 11.6 inches in pocket width and more than 1.6 inches in thickness.</p>
<p>The Mainframe doesn&#8217;t make any allowance for thickness in the cut of the pouch; the pocket panel is cut about a half-inch wider than the back panel of the pack so it puffs out, and the stiff padding materials will bend around a laptop to allow a thicker laptop to fit. Even an old 14&#8243; Thinkpad is a tight fit when you slide it in.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good thing on the whole; modern laptops tend to err on the side of slimness. When we were carrying a Surface and a MacBook Air, they practically disappeared in the bigger laptop pockets and moved around a lot when we walked with them, but the Mainframe keeps slim laptops snug.</p>
<p>In addition to the main laptop compartment, the Mainframe also has a padded tablet pocket, at 8 by 11 inches it&#8217;ll hold a mid-size tablet like the 10.5-inch iPad Pro or Surface Go.</p>
<h3>Useful organization for essentials</h3>
<p>The big, vertical zippered pockets on the Mainframe are a great compromise between a second full-size compartment and a smaller set of handy outside pockets. <strong>These pockets are just right for easy access with the bag slung over one shoulder and pulled in front of your chest.</strong></p>
<p>A fleece-lined glasses pocket is great for fragile and scratch-prone items, but it&#8217;s big enough to nestle a full-size pair of folding headphones.</p>
<p>For hydration on the go, the side water-bottle pockets are also basically perfect. They&#8217;re stretchy elastic mesh, so they don&#8217;t look baggy when empty, and they can secure anything from a compact 12-ounce water bottle to a 32-ounce insulated monster like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">our beloved Klean Kanteen</a>. The side compression straps also make these bottle pockets great for lugging a compact tripod.</p>
<p>One thing this bag doesn&#8217;t do well is keep your lunch separated from your books. With only the one main compartment and a slim profile, stuff gets squished together when you start walking with this pack on.</p>
<p>Of all the bags we tested, the Mainframe was the model everyone loved most. It&#8217;s a great backpack for small to mid-size laptops up to 15 inches, and organization features are ideal for keeping accessories handy during a day at work or the library. It can&#8217;t carry enough clothes for a weekend trip, but for bombing around town it won&#8217;t slow you down.</p>

If the Mainframe is still too big for your minimalist setup, the <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18-liter Ruckpack from REI</a> impressed all of our testers with its thoughtful design that gets the maximum possible utility out of a tiny bag.</p>
<p>Let’s get the drawbacks out of the way: The Ruckpack is not very waterproof, and the thin ripstop nylon doesn&#8217;t inspire as much confidence as the heavier fabric on other bags. The zippers on the Ruckpack are also the smallest in this lineup of packs.</p>
<p>If you fill up the laptop pouch completely with a 15-inch laptop (or even a clunky older 14-inch) you&#8217;ll lose most of the functionality of the side organizer pocket and the water bottle pocket. This bag really only shines if you&#8217;re carrying a laptop that’s 13 inches or smaller.</p>
<p>REI sells a 28-liter version of this back that&#8217;s an inch wider and should be better for carrying a full-size laptop, but it&#8217;s not any less expensive than the higher-quality North Face bag.</p>
<p><strong>The real selling point of the Ruckpack is the organization features.</strong> One zippered side pocket can hold pens, a wireless mouse, every day carry tools and pocket-sized notebooks. There&#8217;s even a dedicated glasses pocket tucked inside. Access to essentials couldn&#8217;t get much better than this.</p>

<p>This is a top-loading bag, and it&#8217;s small. If you only need to carry a small laptop and stuff a sweater and a paperback in the main compartment, the design is fantastic. Even loading up headphones, spare chargers and notepads, we were impressed at how well it carries.</p>
<p>If you want to get your laptop in and out of a backpack as quickly as possible, the zip-around shape of this top flap isn&#8217;t ideal. You basically need two hands to open and close this backpack easily.</p>

All of the things that make this ideal for the trail also make it excellent at carrying your laptop and essential accessories. If you need to carry a 15-inch or bigger laptop, though, this will be too small. </p><a href="hthttp://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank"><button>See Price at REI.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The shoulder straps on the Ruckpack are fully featured, with an adjustable-height sternum strap and a waist belt you can tuck away or remove altogether. The padding on these straps is good for the amount of gear you could reasonably pack inside.</p>
<p>If you find yourself carrying jugs of water or bags of flour, you&#8217;ll definitely want to use the extra straps to take as much weight off your shoulders as you can.</p>
<p>For a slim and budget-priced bag, we were impressed to find a full-size water-bottle pocket that&#8217;s not just floppy netting. The cinch strap does a good job of adjusting for different bottles, and the cinch strap can make this side pouch a good spot for long and bulky items as well. There are even elastic loops and hidden ladder straps if you want to attach pouches or trekking poles.</p>
<p>The only problems we had with the Ruckpack are excused because of the compact size or the price constraints. For a budget-priced bag carrying a compact laptop, the design sensibility on offer here is top-tier.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> is our pick for the best 17-inch laptop backpack. With ample space for a large laptop, but not so many random pockets that you&#8217;ll lose your wallet and keys, this is a big bag that&#8217;s also smart.</p>
<p>Our testers didn&#8217;t rate this bag highest for any one factor, but when we went back and compared bags for how they looked and how well they helped us carry stuff, a few of us gave Targus major bonus points.</p>
<p>This Targus laptop bag carries well. It&#8217;s a bag that feels smaller than it really is, and that&#8217;s almost always a sign of great bag design. The straps are comfortable, and there&#8217;s a sternum strap to keep it from slipping off your shoulders on a long trek or bike ride.</p>
<p><strong>The perfect application for this bag is for anyone who hits the gym mid-day or on the way to work.</strong> For those people, the shoe compartment, laundry bag and toiletry organizer are excellent features that set this bag apart.</p>
<p>Note that the shoe compartment at the bottom of this bag is vented, which makes it better for the stated application but hurts the water resistance of the bag.</p>
<p>There is a small coat-hanger style hook that peeks out of the top of this backpack and attaches to a strap that runs all the way down to the bottom seam. For accessing toiletries and the laundry bag in a locker room, that&#8217;s a really great feature. In some offices, it might also work, but we can&#8217;t see it being useful in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>One downside to a full-zip main compartment design like this is that you might accidentally open the bag farther than you intend. If you just want to get your laptop out and wind up dropping books on the floor, that&#8217;s annoying.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if this laptop pocket qualifies as TSA-checkpoint friendly. If you have anything in the laundry bag ,and you don&#8217;t separate the velcro-attached shaving kit, it certainly wouldn&#8217;t be. But with the right load-out and an understanding TSA crew, you might be able to keep your laptop in the pouch going through security.</p>

It's not as stylish or rugged as some backpacks, but the features are well-designed.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>Even if you don&#8217;t use all of the features as they were designed, the pouches and pockets are great for keeping your giant laptop and accessories in order.</strong></p>
<p>Compared to the Swissgear and other full-size backpacks we tested or researched Targus hit a good balance of size and function. Some large bags have too many pockets and pouches, and that makes it hard to remember where you stashed seldom-used accessories.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a giant backpack that will replace your suitcase, but it is a great bag to carry large laptops and bulky items in a sensible way. Many people could probably get away with using this as a weekend carry-on.</p>
<h3>Carrying big laptops</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got a giant laptop, there are two ways to carry it in a backpack. You can find a bag like the Targus with a built-in sleeve or pouch that will cradle your big-boned device and keep it from moving around, or you can forget about trying to find the perfect bag and just throw it in a full-size compartment.</p>
<p>Targus made this bag with a pouch that&#8217;s 11-inches wide and an inch thick when empty, which makes it big enough to hold most modern 17-inch desktop replacements. It&#8217;s far more secure than the giant flip-out compartment SwissGear uses, though some bigger laptops won&#8217;t fit.</p>
<p>The pocket features a flap that completely encloses the laptop, which mostly gets in the way when you want to quickly insert or remove your machine. Most bags just use a simple strap for this kind of extra security. Fortunately, you can tuck the flap inside the pocket and mostly forget it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re carrying a tablet with your giant laptop, there&#8217;s also a padded tablet pocket in the second compartment.</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>The quality of materials on the Targus bag is less impressive overall than on the Swissgear or Dakine packs, but comparable to the REI. The mesh padding on the back is ample, but a few of our testers raised concerns about how it will hold up over time.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of recognizable zipper brand names or over-sized coils, the zippers on this bag were actually some of the smoothest-zipping we found. Dakine gets points for using YKK zippers on a backpack that costs less than $60, but Targus seems to have found a supplier that gives even better bang for the buck.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a 17-inch laptop, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> gives you carrying capacity without forcing you into a giant bag.</li>
<li>Open-flat design is great for travel or even the locker room, not ideal at a coffee shop.</li>
<li>The organizer pockets in this bag are aimed at gym use, but they work for organizing other accessories too.</li>
<li>If you change shoes at the office, definitely check out this bag.</li>
<li>Targus bags are easy to find, but are priced fairly high.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;re tired of stretched-out water bottle pockets and broken zippers, and if you take one look at the latest trendy fake rucksacks and shake your head, <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129538%2Fmystery-ranch-rip-ruck-sack-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mystery Ranch offers the Rip Ruck</a>.</p>
<p>For laptops up to 15 inches, this backpack includes a great carry pouch with elastic bands at the side to keep the fit snug. It&#8217;ll take thicker models than the Mainframe, since the main restriction here is the width of the pack rather than the size of the pouch. There&#8217;s a tablet pouch integrated into the laptop pouch, and there are also document sorters in the laptop compartment which are great for large books, notepads and magazines.</p>
<p>The laptop compartment in this backpack is nearly perfect. It&#8217;s the rest of the bag that was polarizing.</p>
<h3>Materials and comfort</h3>
<p>This is a bag made from 500-denier Cordura nylon, which is an industry standard for rugged durability. It&#8217;s coated on the inside for good water resistance, and this worked very well to keep this bag from feeling soggy after a good dousing.</p>
<p>Mystery Ranch has built their brand around beefy YKK Aquaguard coil zips in surprisingly versatile configurations, and these are very good at keeping out water without relying on flaps. <strong>This is the fastest bag to get gear in and out of, and it only let in droplets of water in our simulated downpour.</strong></p>
<p>Padding on the shoulder straps of the Mystery Ranch makes the bag cushy above all else. The thick padding has enough contouring and a functional adjustable-height sternum strap. There is no waist belt.</p>
<p>The fit and stability of this pack when it&#8217;s weighed down mostly feels like a half-baked version of the fully-adjustable suspension system that Mystery Ranch uses on bigger bags. That said, if competition for this bag is supposed to be the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G4ZYFXI/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kanken</a> or other classic leather-and-canvas rucksack designs with skinny or un-padded straps, the Rip Ruck is pure joy.</p>
<p>One of our testers was quick to note that he was very disappointed that the so-called &#8220;black&#8221; Cordura nylon was an inky-green and didn&#8217;t match the black straps and zippers. The other styles available make that contrast look less accidental, but this is not a bag for people who are picky about aesthetics.</p>
<h3>Too many zippers</h3>
<p>Mystery Ranch is probably best known for the three-zip design they use on hiking and hunting backpacks, and the Rip Ruck gives you a sample of that utility. The zip on the biggest compartment opens and closes on each side independently, but not up and down for duffel-style packing like other Mystery Ranch bags.</p>
<p>We love the design philosophy of Mystery Ranch, and we love the convenience of opening the one part of a pack you need access to. Most Mystery Ranch bags don&#8217;t offer a quick and easy way to get a laptop out of the suspended pouch, though.</p>
<p>The Rip Ruck is one of the company&#8217;s few designs to separate the main compartment from the laptop pouch (which can also hold a hydration bladder). They&#8217;ve also included two outside pockets, which are a good size for water bottles or other accessories.</p>
<p>The let-down of the Rip Ruck is in all its fasteners. The comment we heard most from testers was &#8220;too many zippers.&#8221; We think it&#8217;s important for a laptop bag to have easily accessible pockets so you don&#8217;t need to dump out your backpack just to find a charging cable or wireless mouse, but the dual-zip-plus-buckle design makes these pockets almost less convenient than an inside pouch.</p>
<p>The dual zippers on the outside pouch pockets help keep a water bottle or travel mug more secure than we expected, but a side-mount elastic water bottle pouch would have been far better.</p>

The Rip Ruck is close to that kind of utility, but the straps aren&#8217;t part of an adjustable suspension system. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F146676%2Fmystery-ranch-urban-assault-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Urban Assault</a> is a much better daypack for hiking, but there&#8217;s an extra zipper and a giant flap between you and easy access to your laptop.</p>
<p>If you want a quality, rugged daypack that also has a laptop pocket, this isn&#8217;t even the best of both worlds. It&#8217;s a compromise, and it leans heavily on using buckles for fashion&#8217;s sake to justify itself. There&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t do with this backpack compared to the others we tested, but we expected better organization features.</p>
<p><strong>So, if you want a bag like a classic alpine rucksacks with updated materials, comfy shoulder straps and room for a thick 15-inch laptop, this is a pretty great backpack.</strong> The Rip Ruck is much easier to use than one with a traditional design and leather cinch-straps.</p>
<p>The rest of the materials and construction quality make this a good value if you like the look and attitude. This is one of those buy-it-for-life bags that you can use for decades without seeing any obvious signs of wear.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129538%2Fmystery-ranch-rip-ruck-sack-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mystery Ranch &#8211; RIp Ruck</a> is a laptop-friendly entry in a lineup of smart, rugged backpacks.</li>
<li>The styling of this bag leans heavily on extra buckles, like a classic canvas rucksack.</li>
<li>Cordura nylon and YKK Aquaguard zips are just a few indicators of build quality.</li>
<li>Not many organization features are included, but the few that are work very well.</li>

<p>Dakine is a company with established credibility in the surf-and-skate scene, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SV9PRBO/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dakine &#8211; Campus 33 liter</a> is their entry-level backpack. As the name implies, this is a student-targeted bag, but it has some features that could make it a good value for anyone toting around a laptop.</p>
<p>Dakine uses good materials in this bag, and it&#8217;s offered in a wide array of patterns. For build quality, Dakine uses the good stuff, like real YKK-branded coil zips. They&#8217;re not the smoothest zippers we tested, so the low price is a reflection of cheaper materials.</p>
<p>Waterproofing on this bag is almost non-existent. Your stuff won&#8217;t get soaked in a brief shower, but this bag let in the most water of all we tested.</p>
<p>Note that Dakine makes the Campus line in a variety of fabrics, so if you love the style but want more waterproofing you can get this bag in the &#8220;squall&#8221; color with waterproof Cordura fabric. The big zips are still going to be the primary source of leaks, though.</p>
<p>The waxed nylon bottom panel used for the &#8220;tamarindo&#8221; colorway we tested is a nice touch, with just the right amount of creasing and patina from daily use.</p>
<p>When it comes right down to it, this is a basic backpack with a giant laptop pouch. It&#8217;s definitely the least comfortable backpack if you intend to fill the big main compartment with books or anything else heavy.</p>
<p>If simple and low-cost are what you want, browse the colorways on offer and see if there&#8217;s a style you like. <strong>Our testers were most dissatisfied with the minimal laptop support provided by the gigantic pouch.</strong> It&#8217;s suspended and padded, but smaller laptops just flop around. The most interesting thing about the bag is probably the smallest outside pocket, which is insulated for carrying a small lunch.</p>
<h3>SwissGear &#8211; Scansmart 1900</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22474" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900.jpg" alt="SwissGear - 1900" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-768x513.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-810x541.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>SwissGear laptop backpacks are some of the best-selling laptop and school bags of all time, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ESKY9FU/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SwissGear &#8211; ScanSmart 1900</a> is one of the most reviewed laptop bags on Amazon. It&#8217;s a giant backpack with some travel-oriented features that might make it good carry-on luggage.</p>
<p>The association between SwissGear and Swiss Army knives is hard-earned, and the brand represents affordable utilitarian bags. The 1900 is really missing a clear purpose behind its design features, though; like a pocket knife with a corkscrew, we&#8217;re not really sure what this is best used for.</p>
<p>The biggest failing of the SwissGear is the laptop compartment. It&#8217;s TSA-approved checkpoint friendly, which means you can unzip the laptop compartment from the rest of the bag and fold it onto the x-ray machine belt without waiting for someone to restock the trays you would need to put your laptop into otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>The Scansmart feature works, but after using these features a few times, our testers agree that it&#8217;s almost quicker to pull the laptop out of a well-designed bag.</strong></p>
<p>The real drawback of Scansmart is that your laptop is mostly bumping around in its giant pouch with only foam padding around the edges to protect it. If your laptop is smaller than a 13-inch model, you&#8217;d probably wind up putting it in an inside compartment.</p>
<p>The SwissGear laptop bag does have a lot of pockets, though. If you&#8217;re diligent about always putting your stuff in the same place so you don&#8217;t lose it, this is a bag that can organize your laptop-toting life.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, the sheer number of pockets is just a liability: This bag will help you lose your keys, your wallet, your passport and your boarding pass on the same layover.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After surveying our friends and coworkers, we came to the conclusion that a laptop backpack doesn&#8217;t have to be overly complicated, but it should help keep your laptop secure and your accessories organized.</p>
<p>In testing, the bag that accomplished that task best for laptops up to 15 inches was <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a>. This bag strikes a balance between elegant and nerdy and offers just enough room to keep track of the stuff most of us need. It&#8217;s not a cheap laptop backpack, but The North Face uses top-grade materials for durability, waterproofing and comfort.</p>
<p>If you only want a slim and affordable bag to carry a small laptop, <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI&#8217;s house-brand Ruckpack</a> gets you some of the same great functionality for about 35-percent less money.</p>
<p>If you need to carry a 17-inch behemoth, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> backpack impressed our testers with sensible organization features that help you carry things most backpacks are just not good at carrying, like shoes.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After weeks writing with the most popular pens on the market, we've determined that the Pilot - G2 is the best. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested 15 pens, ranging in price from just under $1 to just over $25, and found that the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Pilot &#8211; G2</a> is overall one of the best pens on the market. The G2 is America’s top-selling gel pen. Our testers loved this pen for its smooth ink flow, professional look and quick-dry ink. As runners-up, we think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uni-ball &#8211; Onyx</a> is the best rollerball and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate &#8211; InkJoy</a> is the best ballpoint.</p>

<h2 id="how">How we selected pens to test</h2>
<p>If you’ve searched online for pens, you know that there are hundreds and hundreds from which to choose. So, we narrowed down our prospects by focusing only on gel, ballpoint and rollerball pens. These are the pens most commonly used in people’s everyday lives, rather than fountain or calligraphy pens.</p>
<p>We only tested pens that were rated well among online retailers, and for the most part, we selected pens that cost well under $5. (The one exception is the Cross rollerball pen, which was mentioned frequently enough in forums that we had to give it a test.)</p>
<p>We consulted forums like /r/pens/ to find out what inexpensive pens the aficionados were recommending. We browsed through the <a href="https://www.penaddict.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pen Addict’s</a> blog for inspiration and consulted The Wirecutter’s pen review, too.</p>
<p>Finally, we chose to focus primarily on .7 mm pens, which create medium-sized lines and are a good writing choice for a lot of people. However, we also tested some smaller and larger pens for those who want range.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while some of our testers used the pens to freehand draw or doodle, we did not test pens that were created explicitly for drawing purposes. (That’s another review for another time!)</p>

<p>Ballpoint pens are arguably the most popular for everyday use, and for good reason. Their ink writes smoothly and dries quickly. Their refills also last longer than other types of ink. However, the oil-based ballpoint ink can occasionally get messy and blobby at the tip, making it less-than-ideal for longform writing and journaling. Conventional ballpoint pens come in three sizes: fine (making lines .8 mm wide and thinner), medium (1.0 mm to 1.2 mm) and bold (1.4 mm and wider).</p>
<h3>Gel pens</h3>

<p>Many of us remember the thick-lined, metallic and opaque pens of our childhood, often with whimsical product names like “moonlight” and “stardust.” These type of pens get a bad rap from adults, who can see them as impractical. One of our designer-testers even specified that they’ll test “anything but gel pens, please!”</p>
<p>But while there <i>are </i>a number of youthful-looking gel pens on the market (like the Gelly Roll we tested), there are also plenty of quality, businesslike pens that you may not know use gel ink. Gel ink is simply pigment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_pen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water-based gel</a>. If you’re looking for strong colors and sharp, featherless lines, then a gel pen is probably a great choice for you.</p>
<p>That being said, if you’re left-handed, you should <a href="https://www.penchalet.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-pen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay away from gel</a>. It doesn’t dry as quickly as its ballpoint and rollerball counterparts.</p>
<p>Conventional gel pens come in three sizes: micro (making lines .5 mm wide and thinner), medium (.7 mm) and bold (1.0 mm).</p>
<h3>Rollerball pens</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11083" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_9843-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Rollerball pens use a dark, saturated, fast-flowing liquid ink. They create finer lines than a conventional ballpoint pen, and unlike gel pens, the ink dries quickly enough for left-handers. Because of the free-flowing ink, rollerball pens require less pressure, making them more comfortable to write with.</p>
<p>However, a rollerball’s intense ink can sometimes bleed through paper if you’re not careful, and the pen can leak if it’s left uncapped or taken to high altitudes. Conventional rollerball pens come in three sizes: micro (.5 mm), fine (.7 mm) and bold (.8 mm and wider).</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>A pen can seem like a deceptively simple product, but there’s a lot that goes into making one great. Ask any pen aficionado and they can wax poetic about nibs and ink flow for hours. However, for the purposes of the everyday pen user, there are only a few things you need to keep in mind:</p>
<p><b>Ink flow:</b> You want a pen that creates a clean, consistent line. It shouldn’t skip, bleed through the paper, or feather out into more tiny lines. Similarly, the ink should come out easily, requiring you to put very little pressure on the pen.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SiegePenGIF.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><b>Comfort and aesthetics:</b> The pen should look nice sitting out on your desk, but more importantly it should be designed to hold comfortably. Look for lighter pens. They will be easier on your hand than heavy ones. And don’t be fooled by pens with soft grips included on them; they’re not necessarily any more comfortable.</p>
<p>You can make your pen even more comfortable to hold by using it correctly. This may seem like an elementary skill, but many of us are doing it wrong (or have forgotten proper form in the age of the keyboard). Remember to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press down only as much as you need to get a smooth line</li>
<li>Use good posture to prevent writing fatigue</li>
<li>Write from your arms and shoulders, rather than your fingertips</li>
<li>Use quality paper; we tested our pens on classic Moleskine notebooks</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Line width:</b> Most pens are marketed with a millimeter measurement somewhere on the package. This measurement refers to the width of the line your pen will create. Many people enjoy writing with a .7 mm pen, which is a medium width. If you like to write with smaller letters, you can get pens in .5 mm, and some brands make them even finer than that.</p>
<p>If you like to make big, bold strokes, you can pick something with a 1.0 mm width or greater. Some consumers find that they like a certain brand and model of pen, but only in a certain size. So if you think a pen is a good fit for you, but you don’t quite love how it writes, try sizing up or down.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We started by rounding up a group of designers at our <a href="https://www.siegemedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content marketing agency</a> in San Diego, and gave them each a few pens and a Moleskine notebook to call their own. In the weeks leading up to our formal focus group testing, they were encouraged to use the pens daily, whether it be for journaling, making grocery lists, signing cards or sketching out plans for the next photoshoot.</p>
<p>Then, we asked them to join us in a focus group, where they wrote assigned sentences (using every letter of the alphabet). Then, they had “free time” to use the pen however they pleased. After this process was complete, they filled out a survey about the experience using each pen.</p>
<p>The survey asked questions including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>How much pressure did you have to exert on the pen to write?</li>
<li>Was it comfortable to use this pen? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Does the pen ink smear if you touch it soon after writing?</li>
<li>What has been your overall experience using this pen?</li>
</ul>
<p>After the focus group, we tested our worst offender and best pens on cheaper notebook and scratch paper, to see how they’d act. We found the results to be just about what we expected; lesser-quality pens wrote even more poorly on cheap paper, and good quality pens wrote about the same, save for a slightly less-smooth flow.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">The best overall: Pilot &#8211; G2</h2>

<p>Like a popular celebrity, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pilot- G2</a> inspires polarized opinions. People seem to either <i>love</i> or <i>hate</i> the G2 — and we have our suspicions that some hate it just because it’s so well-loved!</p>
<p>When we started our testing, we didn’t know which side of the fence we stood on for the great G2 debate. (Though we always lean toward skepticism.) After testing, though, it was clear that the G2 was the best pen overall, and by default the best gel pen. Our testers loved the writing experience with this one: a smooth flow of ink with no skipping, no feathering and no bleeding. The ink dried quickly as they wrote, meaning it’s a good pen for left handers. They also noted that the G2 had a pleasing haptic feedback when you clicked it, and that it looks professional enough to use in a meeting.</p>

Its smooth gel ink flow makes your writing look more clean and elegant. Plus, the ink dries quickly.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The G2 is retractable, meaning you can carry it around in your pocket without being jabbed. It’s also refillable, but according to Pilot, you won’t have to refill it often. They say that their pen is “proven to last longer than the average of competitive gel ink brands.”</p>
<p>It’s available in four sizes (.38 mm, .5 mm, .7 mm and 1.0 mm) and comes with a comfort grip. (Though, many pen enthusiasts will tell you that these included rubber grips don’t necessarily add to the comfort.)</p>
<p>One thing to beware of with the G2 in finer sizes: its thin point allows you to create beautifully thin and close-together characters, but won’t mask any shakiness in your hands. So if you don’t have a steady grip (or tend to go hard on the caffeine), you may want to choose a different pen — or opt for a bolder point. If you do choose the G2 in a fine point, it should set you back less than a $1.50 per pen.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a pen of the rollerball variety, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uni-ball &#8211; Onyx</a>. Sleek, black and professional looking, our testers gave the Onyx high marks for its lightweight and fine tip. It doesn’t bleed or feather or skip when you’re writing with it, and it creates a nice uniform line.</p>
<p>The Onyx does require slightly more pressure to write with (and has a lighter-pigmented ink) than our top pick, but for the more heavy-handed writers, this may be a welcome feature.</p>

<p>What prevented the Onyx from being our No. 1 pick? It can smudge if you touch it too quickly after writing, which makes it non-ideal for left-handed writers. One tester also remarked that “this pen was [their] favorite … but [they] could tell it was an overall cheaper model.” We don’t consider this a fatal flaw though; at less than 50 cents a pen, it <i>is</i> a cheaper model.</p>
<p>Those who aim to be more eco-friendly will like that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Onyx</a> is made from 80 percent post-consumer recycled electronics — a fact uni-ball is proud of, as evidenced by the “eco” logo on each pen. uni-ball says that their Onyx ink also protects against “water, fading and fraud.” However, we didn’t test for this.</p>

<p>Ballpoint is the most popular type of pen, so it’s surprising that our top pick is a somewhat less popular brand. Sure, Paper Mate products are ubiquitous in the office supply world, but their pens have notably fewer reviews on Amazon — and are hardly discussed by pen enthusiasts. In the interest of diversity, we tested a few Paper Mate’s anyway, and we’re glad we did. Our testers loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InkJoy Ballpoint</a>.</p>

The InkJoy truly is a pleasure to write with. It's extremely comfortable to write with, and will likely cost you less than a dollar per pen.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>They found that the pen didn’t bleed or feather, and it didn’t smudge either. They thought the pen’s grip was solid and comfortable, which led to nice, uniform lines. The one minor discrepancy with the Paper Mate was that each new pen requires a bit of “warming up” the first time around before it stops skipping and starts writing smoothly. At most retailers, the InkJoy will cost you well under a dollar per pen.</p>

<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Energel-X (gel): </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005EE4UG2/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pentel &#8211; Energel</a> is another pen that most people either love or hate. We fell somewhere on the <i>like</i> end of that spectrum. On the plus side, it has a nice grip, requires little pressure to write with and doesn’t bleed. It creates a uniform lines and the ink flows smoothly. However, the Pentel does have a tendency to feather, and it can smear if you touch it right after writing. For these reasons, one tester claimed that it made them “write messier than [they] already do.” So, buy this one at your own risk — if you have nice handwriting and prefer a dark, saturated ink, it may still be a great pen for you. The Energel-X will likely cost you over $2, making it a little bit more of an investment than your typical office supply pen.</p>
<p><b>Zebra &#8211; F-701 (ballpoint): </b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002L6RB80/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zebra</a> is an esteemed name in the world of writing utensils, and after testing their F-701, we can see why. Aesthetically, it stands out from the other pens with its sleek, all-metal body. Our testers said it felt sturdy, and they liked the textured grip. It met all the basic requirements of a good pen: no skipping, bleeding or feathering and a smooth and uniform ink flow. It also doesn’t smudge when you touch it. Our testers’ primary complaint is that the ink is relatively light in color — something you may not expect from a pen that costs over $5. <b> </b></p>
<p><b>uni-ball &#8211; Jetstream Premier (ballpoint): </b>A crowd favorite, uni-ball makes a slew of good quality pens, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PV13JK/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jetstream Premier</a> (about $7) is one of them. Testers especially appreciated some design features of this pen, namely the softened click action and large grip. The only flaws we found were that its ink doesn’t dry very quickly, and it requires a moderate amount of pressure to write.</p>
<p><b>Uni &#8211; Jetstream (ballpoint): </b>We also liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BYNGGO/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni &#8211; Jetstream</a>: a pen with a bit of cult following. Different in design from the Premier with its thick gel grip, testers were a fan of its smudge free ink and comfortable hold. One tester noted that though it writes well, they wish the “grip was a little less squishy.” They felt like they “lost a little control with how thick it is.” One of the most expensive pens on our list, the Uni will cost you over $10 at most retailers.</p>
<p><b>Pilot &#8211; Precise V5 (ballpoint): </b>Pilot, the makers of our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">best pen overall,</a> also did a good job with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00347A8C6/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">V5</a>. Our testers loved the way this pen writes, and appreciated its uniform and even ink flow. It didn’t bleed or feather, and it required only a small amount of pressure to write. Our only gripe with the V5? It doesn’t have much of a grip, which can make it hard to hold.</p>

<p><b>Sakura &#8211; Gelly Roll Classic (gel): </b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B075VLPL1F/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sakura</a> makes many of the fun, glittery gel pens that added color to our childhood, so we were hoping we’d like their office-appropriate black gel pen. However, we found it very uncomfortable to write with. It also skipped more than the other pens we tested.</p>
<p><b>Cross &#8211; Beverly (gel): </b>Cross is known for making higher-end pens that can cost as much as $10,000 (like their discontinued AT0086-107G). We tested one that costs significantly less than that; their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012ENWGI4/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beverley</a> pen rings in at about $30. <b> </b>Even though the Beverley is on the (very) low end of the cost spectrum for Cross, it’s still significantly more expensive than the other pens we tested. So, we expected excellent results. To our dismay, the Beverly was uncomfortable to write with, tended to feather, bleed and smudge and had a confusing design that made the cap seem like it was on backwards.</p>
<p><b>uni-ball &#8211; 207 Retractable (gel): </b>uni-ball may be popular among writers everywhere, but they missed the mark on their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FDR47E/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">207 gel pen</a>. Our testers found that uni-ball’s gel formula feathered and didn’t create very uniform lines.</p>
<p><b>Paper Mate &#8211; InkJoy (gel): </b>Though Paper Mate’s ballpoint version of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B019QBOG4Y/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InkJoy</a> was the best in our tests, we weren’t as impressed by the gel version. We found that it feathered, bled and tended to smudge.</p>
<p><b>Bic &#8211; Round Stic Xtra Life (ballpoint): </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00347A8NK/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bic</a> felt like a standard, uninspired office pen. It was uncomfortable to hold, required a decent amount of pressure to write with, and the ink often felt dry and uneven.</p>
<p><b>uni-ball &#8211; Vision &amp;</b> <b>Vision Elite (rollerball): </b>Both uni-ball’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE8J/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vision</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002S5383G/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vision Elite</a> feathered, bled and smudged. The Vision also failed to deliver a smooth flow or a uniform line.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>A good pen can make the everyday tasks, from taking notes in a meeting to making a grocery list, a little bit more pleasant. And the good news is, they don’t have to cost you a fortune. All of our top pens cost under $5, and some of them cost under $1. If you’re looking for the perfect all around pen, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058NN4C0/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pilot &#8211; G2 gel pen</a>. If you need a rollerball pen, choose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IE87/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uni-ball Onyx</a> for clean-writing lines, and if you prefer the more utilitarian ballpoint style, opt for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U9TEEA/?tag=ybdpen-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate InkJoy</a>.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>To find the best mechanical pencil, we scoured forums like r/mechanicalpencil and blogs like <a href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2008/12/15/review-uni-ball-kuru-toga-mechanical-pencil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pen Addict</a> (Brad and his friends also love pencils) and <a href="https://bleistift.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bleistift</a> to get an idea of the pencils the obsessives like best. We also consulted Wirecutter’s and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/08/pencils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired’s</a> reviews of mechanical pencils. Then, we took to Amazon to find the most popular and highly-rated pencils loved by consumers.</p>
<p>We mostly chose pencils sized 0.5 mm to 0.7 mm, but we also tested some larger sizes for those who like range. We know that different people are looking for different levels of quality (and “keepability”) in a mechanical pencil, so we also tested a range of price points, from around 15 cents to 25 dollars per pencil. We tested brands known for their mechanical pencils (like Pentel) and the big two technical drawing brands, as well as some traditionally cheaper brands like Paper Mate.</p>

<h2 id="why-use">Why use them?</h2>
<p>A good mechanical pencil can create smooth, consistent lines (without the need for sharpening). It’s convenient for travel, and is guaranteed not to stain your pocket with ink. There are plenty of studies that show that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handwriting engages your brain</a> better than typing, and some would argue that the more tactile experience of graphite on paper connects you even more to your writing.</p>
<p>A mechanical pencil is refillable and looks more professional than a traditional pencil. Best (and most obvious) of all, its lead is erasable. So you can leave the correction fluid in the drawer. Tradition dictates that pencils should be used for rough sketches, arithmetic, and any other time that you might need to erase or change the marks you&#8217;ve made.</p>
<p>A high-quality mechanical pencil will almost always cost you less than a high-quality pen. And lest style be a concern, rest assured that there are plenty of attractive (and even pen-like) mechanical pencils on the market these days.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Lead size and grade: </b>Most people will like a 0.5mm or 0.7mm width pencil (the width refers to the size of the lead and the line it creates), but there are smaller and larger widths available if you prefer. Lead can also vary in hardness, which changes the shade and the strength of the tip. If you’re a heavy-handed writer or don&#8217;t want smudging, you may want to go with a lighter and harder lead; mechanical pencils often use different grades than regular pencils so they can make the leads stronger so interpreting the grades is tricky.</p>
<p><b>Cost: </b>Mechanical pencil costs can vary dramatically. But just like we learned testing pens, the most expensive isn’t always the best. You should be able to find a mechanical pencil you love for just a few dollars or less.</p>
<p><b>Grip: </b>A pencil grip won’t necessarily make your pencil more comfortable to use, and some people actually find them cumbersome. But if you want a pencil with a big, squishy grip, we know the perfect one for you. Surprisingly, our testers found the grips on some of the higher-end mechanical pencils more uncomfortable — perhaps because they’re designed to keep your grasp firmly in place, but not cushion your hand.</p>
<p><b>Lead advancement: </b>The classic mechanical pencil model requires you to click the top to advance the lead. Some newer models have a side-click mechanism instead. Others still have a twist advance. What’s best for you comes down to preference, though the idea behind a side advance pencil is that it’s quicker and disrupts your writing flow less.</p>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Siengepencils.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p><b>Retractable vs. capped: </b>Standard mechanical pencils are retractable, but if you want to look more polished in the boardroom, Pentel makes a capped version.</p>
<p><b>Lead cushioning: </b>Some mechanical pencils use a lead cushion or guard that reinforces the lead against rougher writing styles. If you’re aggressive with your writing utensils, you may want to consider it.</p>
<p><b>Materials and aesthetics: </b>Just like other writing utensils, there are an array of colors and styles of mechanical pencils available. You can get ones that resemble a pen or a conventional woodcase pencil, or you can get something bright and colorful. As a general rule, don’t assume that the quality of the pencil’s “look” is equal to how well it writes.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We recruited the same group of illustrators, hand lettering artists, bullet journalers and designers that we used for our best pen testing to test mechanical pencils. We gave them several weeks to use the pencils throughout their everyday lives, jotting down work notes, writing grocery lists and sketching designs. For quick notes and sketches like this, our testers found that almost all of the mechanical pencils were acceptable. The one exception? The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LXM47K/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pilot &#8211; Eno</a> pencils, which came with lead that broke immediately upon use.</p>
<p>Then, we conducted a focus group in which our testers used each pencil to write assigned sentences (that used every letter of the alphabet) and doodle their own whimsical creations. After that, each tester gave detailed feedback on the experience of using each pencil. From there, we did a qualitative analysis to determine which mechanical pencil was the best.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, our testers had much stronger opinions about each pencil after being forced to write for minutes on end with each one. Also unsurprising, most feedback had to do with comfort rather than how the pencil actually wrote.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">The best overall: Pentel &#8211; Quicker Clicker</h2>

<p>By a narrow margin, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pentel &#8211; Quicker Clicker</a> (0.5mm) took first place in our tests for best mechanical pencil for writing. We liked its slick design and its smooth feel, and at just a few dollars, it’s high quality for a low price. Refilling it was easy, and so was advancing the lead.</p>
<p>Pentel is a Japanese-held company that has been innovating in the stationery industry since the mid-forties. They’ve come up with a lot of “firsts,” including the Quicker Clicker mechanism — Pentel says it’s the “original side-advance mechanical pencil.” It comes standard with Pentel lead and eraser, a strong metal clip and a transparent barrel so you can see the status of your lead. You can purchase it in a myriad of colors, and we especially like the classy look of the sky blue.</p>
<p>There are many a loyal Quicker Clicker devotee out there. Unfortunately, many who have been using it for years don’t like the new and “improved” model with the rubber grip. Our testers weren’t bothered by the grip, but some didn’t like the side advance as much as a “traditional” mechanical pencil that requires you to click the top.</p>

With smooth lead and a slick aesthetic, the Pentel - Quicker Clicker is both a joy to write with and attractive enough to leave out on your desk.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><b>Though the </b><b>Quicker Clicker</b><b> has fine lead, it didn’t break when we were writing — even when used by a heavy-handed writer.</b> It also required very little pressure to write with, which will save you from hand cramps if you’ll be writing for a while. The Quicker Clicker, which our testers described as “smooth and reliable,” comes in three line widths: 0.5mm, 0.7mm and 0.9mm. You can get its lead in the traditional graphite (No. 2 grade), or in shades of violet and blue.</p>
<p>The eraser on the Quicker Clicker is high quality, as far as attached mechanical pencil erasers go. In our testing and regular use, we didn’t notice a lot of residue or “smearing” left from erasing mistakes. One thing to be aware of: Some Amazon users complain that the eraser refills for the Quicker Clicker are hard to find in brick-and-mortar stores. That being said, they’re readily available online.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026ICM1E/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni-ball Kuru Toga</a> (0.5mm) was a standout in our tests. Uni-ball is one of the most highly regarded brands in the stationery world, and the Kuru Toga is one of the most frequently discussed (and recommended) mechanical pencils by the aficionados. We can see why. The lead is high-quality and doesn’t break when you write with it. It’s got a hardy plastic body and clear grip, and feels balanced in your hand.</p>

Only narrowly missing the first place mark due to its hard-to-refill lead, the Uni-ball Kuru Toga impressed us with its high quality and virtually break-proof lead.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026ICM1E/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon</button></a></div></div>
<p>Uni-ball was founded in Tokyo, so it’s no wonder that its name is Japanese. The Kuru Toga was <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/kuru-toga-a-comprehensive-guide/pt/706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named</a> with a Japanese portmanteau of “rotating” and “to become sharp.” This aptly describes the pencil’s rotating lead mechanism which keeps lead, you guessed it, consistently sharp.<b> For this reason, we think it’s one of the best mechanical pencils for writing longform.</b></p>
<p>Like with a traditional mechanical pencil, you click the top of the Kuru Toga to advance the lead, and from there it flows nice and smoothly. So why isn’t the Kuru Toga our first-choice pick? Changing the lead is a little more difficult than usual, due to the very small opening the pencil provides to insert the lead.</p>
<p>Even so, the Kuru Toga beats every other pick in terms of quality and smoothness of writing. And in those respects, it’s also right on par with the Quicker Clicker.</p>

<p>Our testers found this pencil comfortable and easy to use. <b>One tester even went so far as to say that it was his favorite to write with — even more so than the expensive pencils. </b>The only concern with the Paper Mate? The eraser doesn’t erase very well. But with the ubiquitous and cheap auxiliary erasers available on Amazon, we don’t consider this too big a problem. In fact, you could purchase one of these mechanical pencils and a separate eraser for less than the cost of some of the other pencils on our list.</p>
<p>Like our top pick, the Paper Mate requires you to click the side of the pencil to advance it. It’s got a clear barrel so you can see the status of your lead, and it has a textured grip that some users will like. It’s worth noting that this one also comes in a colored pencil version with an array of rainbow leads available.</p>

<p><b>Zebra &#8211; M701:</b> Zebra is a big name in writing utensils, and we’re generally impressed with their products. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003G4SSLK/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M701</a> is not an exception. It’s got the weighted, smooth feel of a high-quality pencil and it encourages neat handwriting. Plus, while the grip isn’t smooth, it also doesn’t dig into your hand. The Zebra lost points because it felt especially heavy, which can tire your hand out over time. Still, some writers may prefer a weightier pencil. At over five dollars, it’s more expensive than most of our pencil picks, but we also think it’s one of the best quality mechanical pencils out there.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Sharp Kerry: </b>There’s no doubt that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quicker Clicker</a> is the best Pentel mechanical pencil, but the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006SW6YO/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Sharp Kerry</a> is probably the classiest. It looks exactly like a capped pen until you remove the cap and see its point. Some testers found it a bit slippery and hard to hold on to. Nonetheless, it can’t be beat for its sophisticated look, and when all is said and done, it writes well.</p>
<p><b>rOtring &#8211; 600 Series: </b>This is a classic design that has an avid following among designers; we’ll call the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001A1POWC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rOtring</a> a luxury mechanical pencil. At more than 25 dollars, it’s certainly an investment. As we would hope, it performed well on almost all accounts: smooth, break-free lead and controlled writing included. If you want a pencil that doesn&#8217;t get in the way when you&#8217;re using a stencil or ruler, this is a great pick. The only thing we didn’t like was the tiny hole you’re forced to fit the lead through when you refill it. It’s a minor complaint, but for a pencil this expensive, we expect near perfection. The rOtring comes pretty close.</p>
<p><b>Uni &#8211; Kuru Toga Roulette: </b>Similar to our runner up, but with an upgraded metal body and knurled grip. Our testers found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004OHNTVC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni &#8211; Kuru Toga Roulette</a> to be “light and efficient” and an overall joy to use. There’s not much to pick on with this pencil — we love its performance. This is a good thing, since one will cost you about ten dollars. If we had to pick something to dislike, we’d say the eraser on this pencil is a little small.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; GraphGear 1000 Automatic Drafting: </b>Our testers found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAU2RU/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GraphGear 1000</a> to be delightfully “futuristic,” and they also liked that the top clicks into place like a pen when you advance the lead. It’s nicely weighted (not too heavy or too light) and writes well and smoothly. The only downsides? Some testers found the lead filling process a little cumbersome and the lead itself a little weak.</p>
<p><b>Staedtler &#8211; Silver Series: </b>A pencil with the name “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BNHMC8/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Series</a>” (and a price point of over ten dollars) invites some big expectations, and for the most part the Staetdler didn’t disappoint. It&#8217;s available with an extra-sharp 0.3mm size and writes precisely and smoothly. Like the rOtring, this is a technical pencil well-known among architects, planners, and designers. Our testers’ biggest complaint with this pencil was the grip; most found it somewhat uncomfortable. If you’re not writing longform content though, this pencil might still be for you.</p>
<p><strong>Paper Mate &#8211; 1.3mm Mechanical Pencils</strong> Paper Mate markets these as an alternative to the traditional woodcase pencils, and they do look like a fat and colorful version of the original. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CRGP8B6/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1.3mm</a> are targeted toward young children who are just learning to write — the larger width of these utensils makes them easier for little hands to control. However, there were plenty of user comments from full-grown adults who love these pencils and the thick lines they create. Are they right for you? It comes down to taste. Most of our testers found them very comfortable to write with.</p>
<h3>Pencils we don&#8217;t recommend</h3>
<p><b>BIC &#8211; Xtra Sparkle: </b>With a name like “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007L1VLO/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xtra Sparkle</a>,” we didn’t expect this BIC to deliver high-octane pencil performance. Still, with nearly 2,000 Amazon reviews, we had to give it a go. Unsurprisingly, it was sub-par in almost every way. When asked to describe it in two words, one tester said “meh” and “whatever.” For quality, we give this one a 50 percent. For jazzing up your kid’s pencil box? A solid 100.</p>
<p><b>Pilot &#8211; Color Eno: </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LXM47K/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Color Eno</a> are the only “colored pencils” we tested, again due to their high number of reviews. Their primary tester, a designer, actually loved their hues. However, he found that the lead broke easily and that the pencils were overall “not super reliable.”</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Sharp Automatic:</b> The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SBSAYE/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sharp Automatic</a> is another pencil that probably lands somewhere in the “meh” and “whatever” zone. It doesn’t stand out for much except its uncomfortable grip and the distinctive way it makes you feel not-in-control of your own writing.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; Twist Erase: </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00822DZLY/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Twist Erase</a> has a cool name, but the lead is too light, thick and dull. Our testers found that you have to press harder than is comfortable to use it. Another complaint: It doesn’t allow for very good control of your writing.</p>
<p><b>Pentel &#8211; GraphGear 500: </b>We loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GAU2RU/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GraphGear 1000</a>, but its little brother didn&#8217;t make the same impression. We found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006HXQXA/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">500</a> to be dull and fragile, with lead that breaks too easily and a lead changing process that’s too time-consuming. This one isn’t worth paying over five dollars for.</p>
<p><b>Alvin &#8211; Draft-Matic: </b>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VTP62U/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alvin,</a> another “luxury” pencil at over ten dollars for one, disappointed us. It’s sleek and cool looking, but it’s uncomfortable to hold, it’s too hard to change the lead and it made our writing uneven and scratchy.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We tend to treat mechanical pencils like they’re disposable, but really, a good one should last you a long time. For one you’ll want to keep around, we recommend the all-around impressive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017DBEIG/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pentel &#8211; Quicker Clicker</a>. If for some reason you can’t get your hands on that one, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026ICM1E/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Uni-ball &#8211; Kuru Toga</a> is also a good bet. And if you do want one you can treat like a disposable, then choose the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001T6QCJC/?tag=ybdpcil-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paper Mate &#8211; 34666PP Clearpoint</a>. It’s great quality for a very low price.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ver a long, hot summer, we tested 19 of the top lunch boxes, bags and coolers designed to keep your food cool and fresh. Our top pick for best lunch box is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006HFC3K2/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coleman &#8211; 9-Can Insulated Lunch Bag</a> with removable hard liner.

<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-chose">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We scoured the web for reviews and mentions of great bags. As always, we picked finalists that have plenty of verified purchaser feedback on major retail sites and eliminated contenders with consistent complaints (even if the complaints were in the minority of reviews).</p>
<p>“Lunch box” is a diverse product category. We looked at four groupings:</p>
<h3>Bento boxes</h3>
<p>These are minimalist trays designed to carry enough food to get most people through the day, and nothing else. Most offer some means of carrying silverware, too; if you need more than 900 calories in a lunch, though, this is definitely not the best way to go (unless you’re carrying something like single-serving potato chips and soda in some other bag, in which case portion control might be exactly what you want).</p>
<h3>Lunch bags</h3>
<p>This is a category that’s a bit ambiguous, but for the most part this is an insulated nylon bag that works like a reusable paper sack. The trick is that some of these bags actually have more capacity than small coolers; the major distinction is that they’re tall rather than wide. For adults, we looked at bags with enough room to keep a big sandwich and something on the side. For kids, we were looking for frustration-free opening and intuitive organization features.</p>
<h3>Small coolers</h3>
<p>The most ambiguous category, we defined the small cooler as capable of carrying more than six but fewer than 13 12-oz. beverage cans. These are mostly horizontally-oriented in the way they sit, though you could argue that a few of them are “tall.”</p>
<h3>Large coolers</h3>
<p>These bags can all carry a twelve-pack of beverages with room for ice, and will carry enough food to feed a family or a small party. A few have multiple insulated compartments, which really makes a difference if you’re carrying a lot of different types of food. If you&#8217;re planning on hauling a picnic for a crowd, check out our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">review of the best cooler</a> or the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-thermoelectric-cooler/">best thermoelectric cooler</a>.</p>

[table id=70/]
<h2 class="collapse" id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Number of insulated compartments:</strong> Separate compartments give you the opportunity to take hot or warm items in the same bag without unnecessarily heating up your ice packs in the main compartment. Some of the bags even have insulated pockets. This will be listed as, for example, 2.1 for two main insulated compartments and one insulated pocket.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> People eat different things for lunch; that’s an uncontrolled variable in a comparison like this. We tried to sort our recommendations into three helpful size categories, but we’ve listed the <a href="#the-19-best" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capacities on our master table</a> based on how many 12 oz. cans we could fit into each bag.</p>
<p><strong>Liners:</strong> Some of the bags we tested feature removable liners. While a removable liner is not inherently more waterproof or stain-resistant than a sewn-in liner, it’s easier to deal with a bag that’s dirty if you can take the liner out to wash it.</p>
<p><strong>Accessories:</strong> A few of these bags come with additional items that you might use: beverage containers, picnic flatware and even reusable storage containers.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>We took these lunch bags and coolers everywhere. We took lunch to work, and to the park. We had picnics at the lake, and snacks at the library. We strapped them to a motorcycle, and we even took food to Disneyland in the middle of a hot July.</p>
<p>At the end of our time with the bags, we sat down and rated each one according to these criteria:</p>
<h3>Construction quality</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9473" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/zipper-construction-quality-1024x682.jpg" alt="Construction quality testing" width="900" /><br />
This is a ranking of considerations like stitching, zippers, durable materials, easy-to-clean liners and insulation that seems like it’ll maintain its shape over time.</p>
<p>Lunch bags aren’t like gear bags or luggage where the contents are more valuable than the container, so we didn’t do any abusive tests. We definitely took away points for cheap liners or thin nylon, though.</p>
<h3>Leak-proofing</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9465" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/leak-proof-testing-1024x682.jpg" alt="testing for leaks" width="900" /><br />
Any of these bags will keep food off your car seat, but we wanted to find out if they were good enough to be truly leak-proof. We filled all the bags with water then shook, flipped and dropped them to see how much they leaked. We also scored this category based on how easy it is to clean the liner of a bag.</p>
<p>While each of the plastic single-meal-sized bento options will keep liquids in place, shaking them around means liquid all over the lid of the entire box. PlanetBox’s metal tray is not watertight at all, but the included soup cup is, and that’s definitely the most mess-free way to carry and eat your tikka masala. (Too bad you can’t put it in a microwave.)</p>
<p>The big bags were quite waterproof, but only to a point. None will actually keep water from leaking out the zipper, and even the locking lid on the Stanley cooler will leak if you hold it upside down. So at the end of testing, a five-star rating means that the liner held water perfectly in an upright position and was easy to remove for cleaning. If the bag scored less than a four in this category, that means water had soaked through the liner (or worse, came dribbling out a seam).</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NSM088G/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jaxx &#8211; FitPak</a> can stop leaks with the included accessories: six portion-control-friendly reusable containers. The bag has an easy-to-wash rubberized liner, but liquids will slowly leak out at the seams if they’re not in the containers. (We give the system a five, the bag itself an even three.)</p>
<h3>Design and practicality</h3>
<p>This score is based on a variety of considerations, including bag shape, how comfortable the straps are, removable liners, features like expanding water bottle pockets and any other unique design considerations that made the bag better.</p>
<h3>Insulation</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9464" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/insulation-testing-ice-cubes-1024x682.jpg" alt="testing with ice cubes" width="900" /><br />
According to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/keeping-bag-lunches-safe/ct_index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perishable food like your egg salad sandwich should be kept at 40° F or below.</a> Any higher than that, and you run the risk of bacteria multiplying (yes, there’s already bacteria in your food) to a level that might make you sick. Not all bacteria will make you sick, but unless you can assay a thoroughly representative sample of every lunch you pack… just pack some ice with your fresh food.</p>
<p>To see how much the insulation in these bags can help, we tested each bag in the hot sun. Smaller bags were loaded with three ounces of ice, and the bigger coolers were tested with six ounces. We left all the bags out in the hot sun (ambient temperature was approximately 102 °F) and checked on them after five hours. The score above is the percentage of that 40° target that the bags achieved; higher is better.</p>
<p>The results are not very promising. There was actually very little difference between the bags; smaller bags stayed cooler, but the biggest difference within a category was five degrees Fahrenheit (4% further from the target temperature).</p>
<p>None of these bags would keep a potato salad safe in a car on a hot day without extra ice to soak up the heat. The more ice you keep in your cooler, the longer your food will stay safe; that’s one more reason to carefully choose the capacity you need.</p>
<p>On a hot day in direct sun, even the single ice pack included in the Jaxx kit and the ice-gel-liner in the PackIt bag were insufficient to keep a lunch in the safe zone for five hours out in the sun. The FSIS recommends at least two ice packs per bag, or an ice pack and a frozen beverage. If you have an icemaker and a supply of sturdy zip-seal bags, you can use ice cubes. However, commercial ice packs are durable and convenient. That said, keeping your bag out of the sun is the most important step.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Coleman &#8211; 9-Can Soft Cooler</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9461" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/coleman-lunch-bag-solo-1024x682.jpg" alt="Coleman 9-can" width="900" /><br />
With a hard plastic “tub” style liner, good pockets and all the other features we looked for in a basic bag, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006HFC3K2/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coleman &#8211; 9-Can Soft Cooler</a> represents an amazing value at around 14 dollars. This is an ideal lunch box for adults or even a picnic bag for two.</p>
<p>While the Coleman wasn’t the very best at keeping a lunch cold without ice, the real trick to keeping perishable food safe is to use lots of ice, and that’s what this cooler is built for.</p>
<p>The removable hard liner is an ideal ice bucket. This is perfect for keeping a six-pack well buried on a scorching hot day, or carrying a 12-pack (without any ice) on a less-intense outing. Could there be a better way to design a lunch box for men?</p>
<p>The best thing about the hard tub liner is that it’s easier to clean and dry than the soft zip-in liners used in many of the other coolers. Trying to get the last few drops of water out of a vinyl bag is a pain, but the Coleman will air-dry without problems and is easy to wipe down with a towel.</p>
<p>This makes an ideal lunch bag for large or bulky lunches. There’s a zippered mesh pocket in the lid that will hold a small ice pack, and of course lots of room for more ice packs inside the tub.</p>

<p>The best reason we could find to use a different bag is if you really need to keep warm and cold food separate. With only one large compartment, you need to decide if you want everything warm or ice-cold. Even in a small insulated bag, though, most hot food will cool quickly: unless you’re carrying soup in a vacuum-sealed container, keeping a hot lunch hot for more than an hour is unrealistic.</p>
<p>The other thing this bag didn’t do is carry the picks from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle review</a>. With a 2.9 inch diameter, the 20-oz Kleen Kanteen will barely squeeze into the mesh side pocket, and while it might count as “fitting,” we’re pretty sure the elastic would tear if you did that every day. Most non-insulated 12-ounce water bottles should fit in the pocket, but there’s enough room inside that you’ll wind up keeping your water in there anyhow.</p>
<p>If you only have a small lunch and don’t want to carry around something this bulky, there are other options. This cooler is a better bargain than even the smallest lunch bags we tested, though, so we recommend that everyone consider it first.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Coleman &#8211; 9-Can Soft Cooler is a good size for a bigger lunch and has room for plenty of ice in the hard liner ‘tub.’</li>
<li>Well-built and utilitarian, Coleman designed this bag with a great set of features and options for the price.</li>

<h3>The best lunch box for work</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9470" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mobento-solo-box-1024x682.jpg" alt="Monbento" width="900" /><br />
An insulated cooler with sandwich bags or reusable containers inside is probably the way most people will want to pack a lunch, but there are other options.</p>
<p>If you’re working in an office that has a break room with a fridge, a microwave and a sink, you might be happiest with a compact lunch box.</p>
<p>The Japanese “bento” concept of taking a lunch in boxes with portion-sized compartments dates back more than four centuries, and modern-day practitioners have <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=character%20bento%20kyarben&amp;rs=typo_auto_original&amp;auto_correction_disabled=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made it into an artform.</a></p>
<p>The three compartmentalized boxes we tried each had some quirks, but on the whole, our favorite was the stacking <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DC29MRU/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Monbento &#8211; MB Original.</a> With two stacking compartments, it has room for a decent-sized lunch, and you can fit a small banana or carrot inside without cutting it into tiny pieces. The included tiny dish also works as a divider of sorts, which will help if you&#8217;re looking for a bento box mostly because you don&#8217;t like your foods to touch one another.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DC29MRU/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/monbento-mb-original.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Great for Work: Monbento - MB Original</h3><p>It isn't cheap, but Monbento gives you a clever way to carry a minimalist lunch.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DC29MRU/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Modetro Bento also performed quite well if your lunches are small enough, but it’s not as flexible as the Monbento. All three of the boxes we tested offered some way to seal liquids inside (PlanetBox includes a cup with a rubber lid), but we felt the Monbento’s seal was the most reliable and easiest to clean.</p>
<p>None of the bento-style boxes offered much insulation at all, and even the included carry bag provided with the Modetro box doesn’t give you a way to use an ice pack. (It barely has room for utensils.)</p>
<h3>The best insulated lunch bag</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9463" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/high-sierra-solo-bag-1024x682.jpg" alt="High Sierra with a sandwich" width="900" /><br />
There are two ways to maximize insulation performance in a lunch bag: use a bag that’s no bigger than you need, or take a lot of ice.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D2PJWM6/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/high-sierra-stacked-comp.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best Insulation: High Sierra - Stacked Compartment</h3><p>This bag maximizes the cooling of your ice packs by separating your lunch into two compartments. It also has a separate pocket for stuff that doesn’t need to be kept cold.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D2PJWM6/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In our testing, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D2PJWM6/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">High Sierra &#8211; Stacked Compartment Lunch Bag</a> was 3% better at keeping cold than our top pick, almost certainly because its main compartment is smaller. If you’re not using much ice, this bag will also let you pack non-perishable food in a second compartment where it won’t warm up the food in your main compartment. If your lunch bag will sit in a climate-controlled environment all morning, this is a good way to manage.</p>
<p>The one downside to this bag is that with all those zippers, there’s a bigger chance that any leaking liquids will spill out. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0078K40OC/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid Lunchblox Bag</a> was slightly better at keeping water in for that reason. In either case, you don’t want to pack liquids inside unless you’re very sure they’re not going to leak.</p>
<h3>The best cooler bag</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9462" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ebags-large-bag-solo-1024x682.jpg" alt="Crew Cooler with lunch" width="900" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to keep things cold for a long time but can&#8217;t haul around a large insulated cooler chest, A large bag with plenty of ice is still your best bet. If you need enough food for a few people, then a large bag like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BNN0MM/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crew Cooler II</a> from eBags has room to spare.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BNN0MM/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ebags-crew-cooler.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Jumbo Pick: eBags - Crew Cooler II</h3><p>Designed for airline crews who pack food for long trips, eBags has packed almost every feature you can imagine into this bag: two insulated compartments, two expanding water bottle pockets and beefy construction all around. A generous insulated lid compartment holds hot food or just accessories you don’t want to ice.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BNN0MM/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>We could get 23 12-ounce beverage cans into the two insulated compartments, and the zip-in removable liner is sealed tight so you don’t have to worry about puddles at the end of the day. Like the High Sierra lunch bag, the second insulated compartment is great for stuff that you don’t want to pack in ice — we found that you can fit a bigger-sized DSLR like a Canon 5D in the lid.</p>
<p>The Mojecto &#8211; Large Cooler Bag is very similar to the Crew Cooler, but it’s four inches shorter; it also has a more padded shoulder strap. If you anticipate carrying your cooler any significant distance, that might be a better pick. Both bags have expanding water bottle pockets, a removable liner and quick-release buckles for the shoulder strap.</p>
<h3>The best lunch bag for kids</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9469" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/LunchBoxes_028-1024x682.jpg" alt="rubbermaid lunchblox with school lunch" width="900" /><br />
A small lunch bag with easy-to-use features is going to be the key to success when picking a lunchbox for school kids. Our favorite small bag is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D2PJWM6/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">High Sierra &#8211; Stacked Compartment Lunch Bag</a>, but for school lunches the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0078K40OC/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Lunchblox</a> bag has a few things going for it. The simplicity of a single compartment in the Lunchblox bag might be better for some kids, and the shoulder strap might come in handy for those who tend to drop things and forget them in the hall or on the bus.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0078K40OC/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubbermaid-lunchblox.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Kids: Rubbermaid - Lunchblox</h3><p>This is a simple bag that will hold plenty of lunch and keep utensils organized.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0078K40OC/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The LunchBlox bag is also a tiny bit better than the High Sierra bag at preventing spills, since it makes a better “tub” shape when it’s lying on its back. If you flip it over, though, liquids will still leak through the zipper.</p>
<p>We love that there&#8217;s a place to store utensils securely and enough space to hold a lunch and a water bottle. (Frozen water bottles are a great way to keep perishables cold.)</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="others-tested">Finalists tested but not recommended</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9471" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/other-lunch-bags-1024x682.jpg" alt="The other lunch bags we tested" width="900" /></p>
<h3>Modetro &#8211; Bento Lunchbox</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0178BIE5G/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Modetro Bento</a> is the least expensive of the bento options we tried, and that might be enough to make it your first pick. The main reason we didn’t pick this over the Monbento is size: the three small compartments limit what you can pack. If you’re chopping up all your food and arranging it sculpturally it’s probably a great choice, especially since the lid is see-through, but if you want to include a stick of celery or a carrot you’ll almost certainly prefer the two deep rectangles of the Monbento box. We were also concerned that the white plastic might stain more easily over time than the black plastic of the Monbento.</p>
<h3>PlanetBox &#8211; Rover</h3>
<p>PlanetBox is all about retro cool, and depending on how you look at things <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006IVM9VS/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the all-metal Rover</a> might be more earth-friendly than plastic. There isn’t any other reason we could find to choose this to carry a lunch, though. Without a way to carry ice, you’d better have a fridge to keep it in, but in that case the tray will get uncomfortably cold.</p>
<p>The compartments stamped into the Rover are functional, but small. The best thing about this lunch box is the securely-sealing soup cup, but we’re pretty sure you already have a reusable container that will do that job (and if you don’t you shouldn’t pay these prices to get one).</p>
<h3>Jaxx &#8211; FitPak</h3>
<p>Probably the biggest downside to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NSM088G/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Jaxx FitPack</a> is a lack of flexibility. No shoulder strap, no removable liner, and a design that forces you to find a way to divide your food among four two-cup and two one-cup containers.</p>
<p>The FitPak set is designed for gym gorillas, so it seemed like overkill for most of our testers; if you’re packing for a family it’s a fairly reasonable size (so long as nobody complains about sharing containers).</p>
<p>Many of the other bags will do the same job, though, with enough cash leftover to buy multiple sets of reusable containers. (Those bags all have shoulder straps, too.)</p>
<p>This is probably a pretty good package for someone who specifically wants the accessories included to fit efficiently into one bag, but we can’t rationalize the price if that’s not exactly what you’re after.</p>
<h3>Everest &#8211; Cooler Lunch Bag</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006HMPVEK/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Everest’s Cooler Lunch Bag</a> is a simple product that meets all the basic criteria. It’s sealed against leaks and fairly well-built, but without even a liner or pocket there aren’t any perks. For a few dollars more, the Coleman 9-Can will be easier to clean and hold more lunch.</p>
<h3>Stanley &#8211; 7QT Heritage Cooler</h3>
<p>A stalwart representative of the old school, we have mixed feelings about our time with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0019D78H0/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley’s Heritage Cooler</a>.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this is the most rugged of the coolers we tested — we’re pretty sure you could run over it with a truck, but the editors don’t like it when we do that. “Few people,” they say, “are ever going to drive over a cooler.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, people do have to carry a lunch bag around. This thing has a handle, but it’s not exactly easy to carry. The Heritage Cooler’s divided compartment also holds fewer than half as many cans as the other coolers its size; you can fit nine cans and some ice in the 15.5 inch-wide frame; the EvoVox cooler mentioned below holds 21 cans in a space just 13” wide.</p>
<p>If the Heritage Cooler gained significant thermal performance or leak-proofing over other bags, it might have earned a special mention, but it leaks when you turn it upside down and it doesn’t really insulate very well, either. What you need for long-term food preservation is plenty of ice, and there are cheaper, better ways of carrying ice than this behemoth.</p>
<p>We do like the included vacuum-insulated ‘Thermos’ flask, though. (Buy it separately, or just buy a good <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mug</a> if that’s what you really need.)</p>
<h3>PackIt &#8211; Freezable Lunch Bag</h3>
<p>PackIt had an interesting idea in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HJ8DFGC/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Freezable Lunch Bag</a> that didn’t really pan out in execution. This is a lunch bag only in the most basic sense of the word; it’s a bag, and you could put lunch in it. It’s small, it’s not easy to carry when it’s frozen and stiff, and when we put liquids in it they soaked through the inner liner. If you’re only ever carrying a dry lunch it might be fine, but absorbing liquids generally means smells will start to accumulate over time, too.</p>
<p>Certainly, the idea of a self-contained ice pack is a good one, but it’s not worth the compromises presented here. The High Sierra or Rubbermaid bags are superior in every way, so long as you can make ice, freeze a water bottle, or buy a separate freezable gel pack.</p>
<h3>Mojecto &#8211; Cooler Bag</h3>
<p>For all intents and purposes, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M9DD67G/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mojecto Cooler Bag</a> is the same bag as the eBags Crew Cooler II, but a little bit smaller. (It’s about four inches shorter and holds four fewer drink cans when you pack them tight.) That’s not an exaggeration: the way the compartments are designed and even the expanding-wing water-bottle pockets are almost identical. The zipper on the eBags cooler is a bit beefier, but the shoulder strap chosen by Mojecto is a bit better.</p>
<p>If you don’t need the extra space and you can find the Mojecto for less, it’s a good choice. List price for the Mojecto is higher than for the eBags cooler, though, so if you’re looking for a big bag, just get the bigger one.</p>
<h3>EvoVox &#8211; Insulated Cooler Bag</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018HE44QG/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Insulated Cooler Bag from EvoVox</a> is a great bag, and nearly got our pick for big-capacity cooler. The construction is rugged, and it seems that EvoVox used neoprene or some other stiff foam in the insulation here that makes the sides stiffer and more protective than the spongy foam in all the other bags. It didn’t make the insulation properties any better, though.</p>
<p>The reason this isn’t recommended above the eBags Crew Cooler or the Mojecto bag is that there’s only one compartment. If you’re not going to be carrying anything that won’t squeeze into the pockets this might be a great bag, but we really loved the flexibility of the two-compartment system when we filled the other coolers with ice.</p>
<h3>Oniva &#8211; Pranzo</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006B0MQU/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pranza “Picnic Time” bag</a> was tough to review. Onvia has carefully thought out many of the features included: dual-compartment insulation for hot-and-cold (okay, ice and no-ice) storage, plus a full set of silverware for your romantic day-trip picnic.</p>
<p>If the main compartment were a little larger and included a removable liner, this would have easily scored a special mention. As it is, the eBags &#8211; Crew Cooler II can do everything this bag does and more, so long as you can come up with some silverware on your own.</p>
<h3>Arctic Zone &#8211; Titan</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00URO2JAS/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Titan</a> is very similar to the Coleman &#8211; 9-Can Cooler, but with a liner you can’t remove, a hard lid and velcro instead of a zipper.</p>
<p>We like the removable shelf and the capacity offered by this cooler, but since it sits in the middle of the size range, it’s hard to say for sure it’s going to be big enough for those who pack for a group. The hard lid does seem more robust than the soft lid offered by the Coleman, but it still doesn’t hold water if you flip it upside-down. We’re also not sure how well the Velcro will hold up over time, compared to a zipper.</p>
<p>If you want more capacity than the Coleman bag and find the Arctic Zone Titan on sale, it might be worth going for. At list price, you can buy two of the Coleman bags and get more drinks with the money you saved.</p>
<h3>Igloo &#8211; Maxcold Gripper 16</h3>
<p>If Igloo could have included a liner and a better pocket on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007QEY9ZA/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maxcold Gripper 16</a> without increasing the price substantially, this probably would have been our favorite bag.</p>
<p>If you want to carry around a whole twelve-pack with ice and stuff some hot sandwiches in the insulated lid for an hour, this bag is fantastic. You don’t get a water bottle pouch, though, and the patch-style pockets that are sewn on won’t hold anything bulkier than the flattest of flatware.</p>
<p>The shoulder strap is basic but well-made, and the handle is very comfortable. The stitching is reinforced at all the right spots, and the strap is even sewn on at a slight angle to reflect the way a bag hangs when it’s loaded. The zippers aren’t exactly heavy-duty, but the main zip is sewn with a liner tape for snag-free zipping.</p>
<p>The antimicrobial lining proved to be fully waterproof in our testing, which is good, but we’d take a removable liner over anti-microbial materials any day.</p>
<p>The Igloo Maxcold doesn’t have features that make it an alternative to pricey coolers like the Mojecto, and it’s also not cheap enough to compete with our top pick. The only things it has on the Coleman nine-can is a bit more capacity and a separate insulated compartment in the lid; the Coleman is better in every other way for about $10 less.</p>
<h3>Ramaka &#8211; Large Insulated Lunch Bag</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011AVNESM/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ramaka’s Large Insulated Lunch Bag</a> is basic, but it fared well in testing. It has everything except a removable liner: sturdy YKK zippers, a nice strap and a big water bottle pocket that actually holds a large Nalgene bottle. It’s not that much bigger than the Coleman, though, and without a removable liner it won’t be as easy to clean.</p>
<h3>GreEco &#8211; Large Capacity Cooler Bag</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for the most capacity-per-dollar, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M13FC46/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GreEco’s Large Capacity Cooler Bag</a> does score a win on that metric. We paid $12 and got 18 cans to fit into the super-tall compartment.<br />
The GreEco bag didn’t leak in our testing, but the construction was merely “good enough” and the shoulder strap was quite short. For a basic bag that you could fold up to keep in a glovebox, this one might be worth considering, but we liked the Coleman much, much more as an every-day lunch bag.</p>
<h3>BF Systems &#8211; Extreme Pak</h3>
<p>We hoped that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004F5IZBM/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Extreme Pak from BF Systems</a> would be a good bargain bag, but there were too many corners cut. The biggest problem here is the liner: It’s sealed with some kind of seam tape, but water still leaked through in the course of our tests. It wasn’t a really bad leak, but if you’re going to be toting ice around all day you’ll wind up leaving puddles everywhere. Not recommended.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9472" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/top-three-bags-1024x682.jpg" alt="Top three bags" width="900" /><br />
We’ve tried to include enough data in our review to help you find a cooler that meets your particular needs. What most people want is a bag that holds enough ice, doesn’t leak or get stained and is easy to clean out at the end of the day.</p>
<p>If you want a small bag to carry a simple lunch around, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D2PJWM6/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">High Sierra &#8211; Stacked Compartment Lunch Bag</a> does all the right things. Split stacked compartments help calm your lunch-organization compulsion and help keep the cold stuff colder.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to carry drinks around for an afternoon (or if you’re packing a monster-work-day sandwich) then the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006HFC3K2/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coleman &#8211; 9-Can Cooler</a> (which can hold up to 12 cans) is a fantastic choice. The hard liner makes it perfect for ice, but it also means your lunch won’t get crushed and any spills will be easy to clean up.</p>
<p>We tested some large cooler bags, too, and we loved the features offered by the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BNN0MM/?tag=ybdbox-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags Crew Cooler II</a>. If you want to carry more food and ice than this will hold (between the two compartments you can almost squeeze in a 24-pack of drink cans) then you almost certainly need something with wheels.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>When it comes to choosing the a money clip, there are two primary factors: fashion and function. We aimed to choose clips that had both. We also know that money clips aren’t complicated. At their simplest, they’re just a bent piece of metal. But even so, there are some distinctions you can make about which are higher quality and will serve you better over time.</p>
<p>So, we combed through Amazon reviews to find clips that users loved for their function and efficiency. Then, we consulted trendy sites like HiConsumption and The Coolist to find clips that fashion-forward folks would want to own. Since these sites focus on curation rather than testing, we were sure to thoroughly test every money clip on this list.</p>
<p>In our research, we found that while many people were looking for traditional money clips, many others were also looking for money clip wallets. Money clip wallets are simply cardholders with money clips attached. Most lack the traditional “pocket,” for cash, which many reviewers note cuts down on bulkiness. Still others liked money bands, which, while not truly a “clip,” performed a similar purpose of holding cash and cards together without the bulk of a wallet.</p>
<p>We decided to test all three of these “clip” types for our review, dividing them into the categories of money clips, money clip wallets, and banded money clips.</p>

<h2 id="who-should-use">Should you be using a money clip?</h2>
<p>The answer to this question depends largely on your habit and preferences. If you’re of the minimalist persuasion (or think that you could be), then a money clip is a natural choice. It forces you to cut back to the bare essentials. As one of our money clip testers put it:</p>
<p>“It was difficult to pare down my wallet to my ID, two credit cards and cash, but it finally accomplished something that I&#8217;ve been wanting to do for a while — get my big fat wallet out of my back pocket.”</p>
<p>If you’re dedicated to carrying several forms of ID, your coffee shop rewards card and a picture of your sweetheart everywhere you go, a money clip may not be right for you.</p>

<p>It’s also worth considering that a money clip, not unlike cuff links or a tie bar, can be an accessory for a special occasion. We spoke with men’s fashion and style blogger, Adam York of <a href="https://youraverageguystyle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Your Average Guy</a> who noted that “when the situation demands it&#8230;unleashing a bundle of crisp bank notes tightly clasped together within a stainless steel money clip will always have a timeless appeal.”</p>
<p>Still undecided? Let’s take a look at some pros and cons of carrying a money clip:</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most clips are sleek and unobtrusive, so they won’t ruin the look of an outfit. The <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/02/14/mans-wallet-giveaway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art of Manliness</a> points out that “often underrated, [money] clips are even slimmer than wallets and can be eye catching if you find a good one.”</li>
<li>Most clips will fit in your front pocket, eliminating the need to sit on your wallet.</li>
<li>Money clips force you to stop carrying unnecessary items (like old gift cards) everywhere.</li>
<li>From a style perspective, money clips have a classic, vintage appeal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most clips cannot hold as many items as a conventional wallet.</li>
<li>Some are so lightweight that users say they wouldn’t know if the clip fell out of their pocket.</li>
<li>Some may consider money clips to be an “outdated” accessory.</li>
<li>Poor-quality or too-tight clips could potentially scratch your credit cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last note; there’s no doubt that in the modern age, many of us no longer carry paper money. In fact, according to the Washington Post half of Americans carry less than $20 in cash each day, and 9 percent of Americans carry none. Happily, many clips are just as effective at holding only a few plastic cards. (We’re looking at you, Adamant.)</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to use a money clip</h2>
<p><a href="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/folding-gif.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-7977 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/folding-gif.gif" alt="" width="900" height="506" /></a></p>
<p>If you’ve decided that a money clip is a good option for you, you may be wondering how to use one. Don’t roll your eyes; we know the obvious answer is “you clip your money together!”</p>
<p>However, there actually is <a href="http://www.mademan.com/mm/how-use-money-clip.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some strategy</a> to using one effectively. First, if you have paper money, you should fold it in half. Fold smaller bills on the outside to discourage people from stealing your money. Keep in mind that if you only carry large bills, you’ll likely end up with more change. Once folded, place the money into the clip, folded side first. Then, slide your credit cards in on top of the cash.</p>
<p>If you are using a magnetic money clip, you may want to avoid using it to carry credit cards. There is some concern that doing so will mess with the chip reader on your card. However, reviewers of the magnetic money clips that we tested didn’t find any issue with this.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Type of clip:</strong> There are a few different types of clips from which you can choose. If you’re planning to carry primarily cash, choose a money clip or band. If you have several cards to carry as well, you may want to consider a money clip wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> At the end of the day, all money clips essentially do the same thing: clip your money. So the biggest difference between any money clip is how it looks. There are clips available in everything from carbon fiber to leather to sterling silver, so do some browsing (and set a budget) before you decide. Also consider the weight and width of the clip, since you’ll likely be carrying it most places you go.</p>
<p><strong>Quality:</strong> Does your money clip spring back into place after you open it? Does it seem like it will break if it’s a little overstuffed? Does it have sharp edges that’ll damage your phone screen? Or does it have a cheap finish that’ll show scratches from its scuffle with your keychain? Keep this in mind when selecting one.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> Some of the more poorly designed clips that we tested could barely open wide enough to fit one bill. Others could probably hold a paycheck’s worth of cash, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Based on our assessment of user reviews, there wasn’t a whole lot of quality difference between the cheaper and more expensive money clips. Some reviews claimed that the $20 clips (like the Storus) lasted them a decade, while more expensive ones looked worn-down after a year. So again, this really comes down to aesthetics. If you want something in solid aluminum or something gold plated, prepare to pay a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>RFID blocking:</strong> Many of the money clip wallets that we tested came with RFID blocking technology, which is supposed to stop thieves from stealing your credit card data. Does your wallet actually need this feature? It’s <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/07/04/535518514/there-are-plenty-of-rfid-blocking-products-but-do-you-need-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debatable</a>. You can also achieve the same RFID-blocking effect with a piece of aluminum foil.</p>

<p>For a product as simple and straightforward as a money clip, we figured the best way to test it was to get it into the hands of every-day users. So, we rounded up ten co-workers (both men and women) and gave them a few simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ditch your wallet and carry all of your cash and cards in a money clip (or money clip wallet, or banded money clip) for one week.</li>
<li>Use it everywhere you go, as you would a normal wallet.</li>
<li>No cheating with an auxiliary coin purse, money pouch or card carrier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our testers did as they were told. Because of the clips’ slim profiles, many of our testers were forced to ditch the old gift cards, outdated IDs and crumpled receipts they’d been carrying. Many saw this as an unforeseen benefit of switching to a clip.</p>
<p>After our testers finished out their week, we asked them a series of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was your money clip convenient to use?</li>
<li>Did your money and cards stay securely in the clip?</li>
<li>How easy was it to both add and remove cash and cards to and from your clip?</li>
<li>How did you carry your clip? (Front pocket? Back pocket? Purse?)</li>
<li>Would you continue to use your money clip after testing?</li>
</ul>
<p>After our testers answered these questions, they repeated the process again with a second money clip (or wallet or band).</p>
<p>Once we had our answers, we did a qualitative analysis to decide which clips were worth testing further. We eliminated the clips that testers found egregiously difficult to use or otherwise problematic.</p>
<h3>Quality check</h3>
<p>Once we had only tester-approved clips remaining, we examined their quality. Did the clips have sharp edges that were likely to scratch a phone screen? Did they feel like they would snap when bent past their natural angles? Did they spring back into place each time they were opened? We noted our observations, then used all of this information to determine the top clip in each category.</p>

<p>Storus, a division of Mosaic brands Inc, makes innovative and unusual “personal storage solutions” that you don’t see on your average trip to the department store (think dual-sided money clips and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FBE0ILQ/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">jelly wallets</a>.) We ordered their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RMO3NK/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smart Clip</a>, which costs between about $20 and $40 depending on the finish you choose. But regardless of the color, it’s secure enough to hold money and cards tightly, while still retaining enough room for a good deal of cash and cards.</p>
<p>The dual sided holders, an anomaly in the money clip world, mean that you can keep cash on one side and cards on the other. The Storus’ durable metal material also stood up well to getting knocked around by keys and purse contents.</p>

It's also the only dual-sided clip on our list that lets you clip money on one side and cards on the other.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RMO3NK/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Upon receiving all of the money clips that we ordered, the Storus immediately stood out for its unique design. Its curved edges, wave-like aesthetic and double-sided clips make it a stand-out in a sea of rectangular clips. We ordered it in the gold color and found that the finish didn’t look chintzy or scratch easily. Reviewers on Amazon also noted that the finish did not wear down after extended use. Plus, our tester shared that this clip even garnered a few compliments when they pulled it out to pay.</p>
<p>The only downside of this clip is that it holds five cards maximum on one side, with our tester noting that (in their experience) it could handle no more than four. Keep in mind though that this clip does have two sides, so you could technically store cards on both. The final verdict from our tester? They’d “definitely continue using it.”</p>
<h2 id="minimalist-pick">The minimalist pick: Adamant</h2>

<p>One of the most common responses to our money clip testing was “who carries cash anymore?”</p>
<p>It’s true, there’s no doubt that we are in the digital age, and many of us rely almost exclusively on credit cards for our transactions. If that’s the case for you, you may want to skip the Storus’ dual carrying capacity and head straight for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3XVNUQ/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adamant</a> instead.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3XVNUQ/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/adamant.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Minimalist Pick: Adamant</h3><p>If you said goodbye to cold hard cash a long time ago, the Adamant is the card-holding clip of your dreams.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3XVNUQ/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>With its cost coming in at just under twenty bucks, this clip’s design is evocative of a bygone era. Its black finish and metallic stripes feel like a vintage car. However, its functionality takes a cue from the modern minimalist movement. The Adamant is best for carrying ID, debit, a couple of credit cards and nothing else; and it holds onto them with an iron grip. Yet despite its tight hold, our tester noted that it was “arguably the quickest and easiest card experience” he’d ever had when it was time to grab a card to pay.</p>
<p>The only downside? According to our tester, this clip’s tight clasp isn’t all that convenient for inserting and taking out flimsy dollar bills.</p>

<p>With nearly 2,000 Amazon reviews, a 4.7-star rating and a sub-20 dollar price point, we knew we had to give the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EBNOQNO/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viosi</a> a try. Luckily, this money clip wallet didn’t disappoint, earning rave reviews from our focus group.</p>
<p>This genuine leather wallet is simple in appearance, with an ID window, several large slots and a magnetised clip on the outside. Our tester noted that it was convenient to use, with the outside clip making it easy to grab cash. Despite relying on a single magnet, this clip gave us no concerns about security. It held on to money firmly until it was time to be removed.</p>

<p>The three card slots and two larger slots in the Viosi also mean that you don’t have to totally convert to minimalism to carry this wallet. There’s plenty of room in it for cards and receipts.</p>
<p>Looking for something even more budget friendly? The folks at Kinzd say their goal is to offer “slim wallets at extremely affordable pricing,” and they seem to be doing just that.</p>
<p>Depending on the color in which you purchase it, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071P82NK8/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kinzd</a> money clip wallet can cost as low as $13 (at time of publish). That’s a great value for a wallet that earned a cumulative 4.5 stars from nearly 1,400 reviewers on Amazon.</p>
<p>This wallet was a favorite among our testers, so much so that others requested to try it even after testing was complete. Our tester noted that everything stayed put in this wallet, and its slim profile made it easy to tote around. Plus, the attached clip held cash safely in place.</p>

<p>The Kinzd wallet is also durable, surviving a skirmish with some books and workout shoes at the bottom of our tester’s bag.</p>
<p>The only downside? The magnetized feature on this wallet clip has a tendency to adhere to other items, like keychains. Though, this may not be a downside if you’re looking to pull all of the essentials out of your bag at once!</p>

<p>If you’re looking for an alternative way to store your money that’s not a traditional wallet and not quite a money clip, consider the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZBADOTS/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prägres</a> wood front wallet. Costing about $14 at time of publication, this contraption is hard to confine to any one money-carrier category.</p>
<p>Our tester was pretty skeptical about this wallet, yet by the end of the week they were asking if they could keep it permanently. They loved the Prägres’ light weight and slim design, which allowed them to carry it in their front pocket. They also traveled with this wallet and found that whipping it out at the airport to retrieve their ID was easy.</p>
<p>The people at Prägres pride themselves on “wallets that make a statement,” and this one will certainly garner some attention. It has a hard, wooden construction that acts as a sort of frame for your credit cards. A band wraps around the entire frame to keep money and cards in place. On the back side of the wallet, you can slide your paper money under the band. A fun add? The wallet comes with three different colored bands to swap out as desired.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, it kept our tester’s credit cards secure, yet allowed for easy removal when it was time to use them. And just in case you plan to do any cannonballs into the nearest pool, the reviews also state that this wallet will float.</p>
<p><i>Editor&#8217;s Note</i>: The wooden version of this wallet is currently sold out, but Prägres makes a convenient and sleek <a href="https://www.pragresproducts.com/collections/all/products/carbon-clip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carbon fiber alternative</a> that comes with a built-in bottle opener.</p>
<p>Looking for an even lower-priced banded alternative? The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AU50H0S/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xband</a> is our budget pick. Costing under $10, the Xband is minimalist in both price and composition. Simple in design, it has two nylon strips in the shape of, you guessed it, an “X,” that hold your money in place. Reviewers loved the simple functionality of this money carrier, and so did our tester. They noted that it was “super convenient,” and they liked that it stayed securely in their back pocket.</p>

<p>More high praise for this simple band? The Xband was easy to put cards and cash in and made it relatively easy to take cards and cash out. Its description claims that you only need to remove one strap to remove your cash, while the other strap keeps the rest of your contents secure.</p>
<p>The only complaint? Much like traditional money clips, the Xband makes it hard to pull just one bill or card out. It’s easier to remove everything, shuffle through it and then clip or band it all back together.</p>

<p><strong>Royce &#8211; Leather Magnetic money clip</strong>: While the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004NZVH5K/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Royce</a> clip didn’t make our top picks, it’s still a quality choice for under $20. Its simple leather construction makes it classy and gender-neutral in appearance. Plus, our reviewer liked that it was “small enough to fit in a women&#8217;s pocket, but not too small to misplace.” The biggest downfall of this clip? Our tester didn’t feel the the magnet was strong enough to hold more than a couple of cards.</p>
<p><strong>Serman Brands &#8211; Real Carbon Fiber money clip</strong>: The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016XBCLW4/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Serman</a> clip feels well-constructed and extremely lightweight in your pocket or bag. It has RFID-blocking technology, and doesn’t scratch easily. What didn’t our tester like about this clip? It’s looser grip meant the clips’ contents got knocked-around easily, and it’s also not the most visually-attractive option on the market.</p>

<p><strong>idclipz &#8211; Slim Carbon Fiber money clip wallet</strong>: Though the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G2CSSNU/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">idclipz</a> wallet clip didn’t make it into our top picks, our tester had rave reviews for it. They loved that it was slim enough to carry in their front pocket, and that the the magnetized clip was strong enough to feel secure. The only downside? A common complaint among our money clip testers: it’s hard to pull one bill out of the clip without everything else coming with it. For another magnetized choice, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EBNOQNO/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viosi</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MUTBAK &#8211; Bunker</strong>: Our tester loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJUVIPA/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MUTBAK</a> for its slim profile and secure clip. It’s also one of the trendier-looking wallet clips on our list, with a worn-in leather look. The only major drawback to the MUTBAK is its overly-deep credit card pockets, which make it hard to retrieve your plastic quickly. Still, if you need a slimmer wallet for a quick vacation, the MUTBAK would be a good choice.</p>

<p><strong>CL Carbonlife &#8211; Carbon Fiber Money Clip</strong>: Though reviewers on Amazon loved the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018HYPYBU/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CL Carbonlife</a>, our tester found that the material was too rigid and made getting money out a difficult experience. In our experience, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RMPQ5O/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Storus</a> is a better pick for your money.</p>
<p><strong>Sharkk &#8211; Stainless Steel Clip</strong>: We think our tester put it best: “the good news about this clip is that the metal is incredibly sturdy and will NOT release your plastic cards. The bad news is that it will NOT release your plastic cards.” They found that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AIY3N02/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sharkk</a> was too stiff, would not budge, and even scratched their credit cards when they tried to yank them out. For a similar design that won’t damage your plastic, we recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3XVNUQ/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adamant</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NapaWalli &#8211; Front Pocket Clip Wallet</strong>: The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073J9W8RP/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NapaWalli</a> has great aesthetic appeal, and our testers liked its small, slim size. However, its downfall was its pockets. Our testers found them so stiff that getting cards out “was a chore.” We recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EBNOQNO/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viosi</a> instead.</p>
<h3>Some more luxurious picks</h3>
<p>Like any accessory, appearance matters. So we decided to share some top-shelf picks that have serious visual appeal. We didn’t test these clips, but they get high style points from an aesthetic perspective. We like the Craighill &#8211; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073GHYYG9/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Square</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073HG1HX6/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wave</a> money clips for their unique shapes, and the <a href="https://www.ahalife.com/product/149000041939/brass-money-clip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maxx and Unicorn</a> &#8211; brass clip for its geometric appeal.

<p>There’s no doubt that minimalism is having a moment, and a money clip ensures that decluttering begins in your pocket (or purse). It should be an item that you buy once and don’t have to think about again for a long time. It should be simple, functional and of course stylish. For the our top pick, we think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RMO3NK/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Storus &#8211; Smart Clip</a> achieves all of those goals. If you’re looking for the best wallet style clip, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EBNOQNO/?tag=ybdclip-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viosi</a> &#8211; front pocket money clip gives you great value at a low price, and for the best banded money clip, the <a href="https://www.pragresproducts.com/collections/all/products/carbon-clip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prägres</a> has our vote.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent over four weeks commandeering the office coffee pot, brewing over 50 pots and consuming about 400 cups to find that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X8NSHGU/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Verena Street &#8211; Mississippi Grogg</a> is the best cheap coffee brand. This light-roast, fair trade and kosher brand out-brewed the competition, pleasing even our pickiest taste tester and receiving complements such as “creamy” and “strong, but not overpowering.” For a bolder flavor profile, we recommend<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006G7WCTI/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Marley Coffee</a> medium roast or<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PV4FG3Q/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Koffee Kult</a> dark roast.</p>

<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Our search began at the local grocery stores to see what was widely available to shoppers. We noted the ubiquitous blends and recorded their price per ounce. We then went to the reviewers on Amazon.com where coffee was available in all varieties. We considered options on Amazon, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Pantry/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=7301146011" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prime Pantry</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonFresh-Grocery/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=10329849011" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon Fresh</a> to find the best-rated cheap coffee options.</p>
<p>We narrowed our list to 20 brands total: 10 brands you know and 10 brands you want to know. Through our research we found that people are branching out to try more coffee flavors, sources and strengths.</p>
<p>Our research was then directed towards the price point and determining what classifies as a “cheap” cup of coffee. If you are heading to Starbucks to grab a grande cup of regular coffee, it will put you back $2.10. McDonald&#8217;s premium roast coffee will cost $1.29. Dunkin&#8217; Donuts medium coffee is $1.89. Frappuccinos, lattes and mochas will double your coffee cost.</p>
<p><strong>Our research has shown that the average ounce of coffee beans costs $0.51.</strong> Given a typical water to bean ratio, the average home-brewed mug costs $0.33 per cup. On the inexpensive side you can brew a cup for $0.15, or with pricey beans you will still only pay $0.57 per cup.</p>

<p>We found that there are a few major differences between coffee brands you know, and ones you don&#8217;t. The first being price. Coffee brands you know had an average per-cost-ounce of $0.51, twenty cents cheaper than unknown brands of $0.73. We first thought this might have been due to production costs from big farms and large processing facilities.</p>
<p>However, we quickly learned about two other factors that affected price: the source and batch size. Most brands you know are Arabica coffee sourced from Ethiopia. Unknown brands had more diverse sources and were a combination of small batch, organic, sustainable, fair trade and/or ethically sourced blends.</p>
<p>Something that kept coming up in our research was “conscious consumerism,” or awareness of the impact your coffee makes on the community, environment and overall quality of life of those who harvest and grow it. Campaigns for products free from animal testing, bee friendly pesticides, compostable packaging and sustainable farming are all part of conscious consumerism.</p>

<p>Sustainable farming is the production of food using techniques that protect the environment, public health, human communities and animal welfare. Seven out of ten of the unknown brands we chose listed organic, fair trade and sustainable farming methods, which is a major reason for the 20-cent increase in average price.</p>
<p>To further our research, we asked all of our coffee testers if they would spend an extra $1.00 on a product if it was proven that the company directly benefited the community or environment. Each tester said yes. In addition, when looking at overall ratings online, organically and sustainably-sourced coffee rated higher overall compared to your typical Arabica coffee.</p>
<p>As a result, the biggest factor affecting your coffee price is not the big brand name but the batch size, sourcing and farming techniques used to obtain it. When choosing a sustainable brand, you can rest assured knowing that while you will be spending a small amount more, you are also doing a small part to help the world.</p>

<p>Your favorite coffee connoisseur might have an argument for single origin vs blended origin beans, but the average coffee drinker will not taste the difference. Each origin has a unique attribute that is added to the bean, but the taste is not the main reason to look into blended or single origin. There are very few regulations that mandate disclosure of type, or percentages, of the blends in your bag of coffee. As a result some expensive blends may be a low percentage of a desirable origin and the majority could be from a less desirable origin.</p>
<p>The important factor to consider with your coffee source is the processing procedure in the location from which it came. For example, coffee beans that are sourced from Ethiopia or Brazil are processed naturally and result in bold and fruity flavors. Africa processes their beans in a washed process that produces more well-balanced and complex flavors with noticeable acidity when roasted. On the other hand, coffee that is sourced from Central and South America tends to be more expensive due to the processing method that reduces mold on the beans.</p>
<h3>Arabica vs. robusta beans</h3>
<p>Coffee can be compared to wine in terms of flavor because it is also affected by soil, altitude and the region in which it&#8217;s grown. The two types of coffee bean options are Arabica and Robusta: But what does this mean? The easiest way to categorize the two is by the altitude in which they grew. Arabica beans are grown in the mountains at an altitude above 2000 feet, while Robusta coffee is found below that, typically on flat plantations.</p>
<p>Arabica is the more desirable bean, and you will find it in nearly all your daily coffee blends. Arabica beans are more popular because they are grown in richer soil that allows the bean to become naturally mild and aromatic. Arabica is a fragile, oval-shaped bean that needs to be grown in cool and subtropical climates. Arabica beans contain about 60% more sugar content than Robusta, adding to their delicious taste.</p>
<p>Robusta plants can carry as much as three times the caffeine  of Arabica, and they are known to have a stronger and harsher taste when roasted. You won’t find Robusta coffee in many blends today as it only comprises 25% of the market, which is mainly restricted to instant black coffees and Italian espresso blends.</p>
<p>Both beans have a range of grades suitable for coffee drinking, but there is a substantial price difference with Arabica beans; they cost nearly double Robusta. This is partly due to the less labor intensive and higher yield harvest. If given a choice, nearly all experts agree that Arabica coffee is the way to go.</p>
<p>All beans we tested were Arabica beans and still fell under the “cheap” category.</p>
<h3>Roast type</h3>

<p>Did you know that lighter roasted coffee actually has more caffeine than darker roasts? The purpose of the coffee-roasting process surprised us. Before roasting, coffee beans are soft with little taste. The roast starts the process of adding flavor. Age, processing method, grind and brew type will also play a role.</p>
<p>Light roast beans and grounds are light brown in color with minimal oil on the surface of the beans. This retains most of the caffeine and tends to be more acidic. Lightly roasted beans reach an internal temperature of 356°F &#8211; 401°F, where they crack just a little and expand in size.</p>
<p>Medium-roasted coffees will show no oil on the surface and have a balanced flavor, aroma and acidity, again with more caffeine than dark roasts. They are roasted to an internal temperature of 410°F &#8211; 428°F, allowing the beans to expand but not past a second crack.</p>
<p>Dark roasts are easily identified with their rich dark brown or black color. Dark-roast beans will have noticeable oil on the surface and taste more bitter, smoky or even burnt. As a coffee roast gets darker, it loses the origin flavors and takes on the flavor mainly from the roasting process. These beans are largest of the three, reaching an internal temperature of 464°F &#8211; 482°F, just past the 2nd crack.</p>

<h3>Ground vs. whole beans and freshness</h3>
<p>Once purchased, the most important factor for brewing your own coffee is the freshness. It’s not a question of whether your coffee will go bad, but when. When making your first cup of coffee in the morning most people would agree that making it quickly and easily is the key, which is the biggest benefit for ground coffee, but you may be sacrificing freshness and taste for convenience.</p>
<p>We love opening up a bag of ground coffee, enjoying the aroma, then easily scooping it into the coffee maker to brew. But, if you have a little bit more time in the morning and a coffee grinder, you will benefit from a bolder-flavored coffee by grinding your own coffee beans.</p>
<p>Coffee beans hold their taste in the bean oils, and once beans are ground, the oils will evaporate and the taste can go flat. The vacuum seal on ground coffee only holds the oil until opened. So as the grounds of coffee go down in the bag, so will the taste. Be sure to reseal the bag after each use.</p>
<p>The question remains, once a bag is open, how long does it last? There are a few factors to consider. The first usually depends on the roast date, the closer to the roast date the fresher your coffee is going to to taste. Next is the coffee bean type, ground coffee doesn’t maintain its fresh taste very long. Seattle Coffee Gear says that ground coffee sealed in a cool, dark place will stay fresh for about two weeks, while properly stored whole coffee beans will stay at best quality for about four weeks after opening at room temperature. Oxygen is your biggest enemy here.</p>
<p>All experts agree that no matter the bean type, ground or whole, they recommend storing your coffee in an airtight container in a cool and dark place. If storing unopened coffee in the pantry, you can expect ground coffee to last up to five months and whole bean coffee to last for up to six months.</p>

<p>Now that we have a better understanding of how complex coffee is, we had to find the best coffee maker to ensure quality control for each brew. We chose the award winning and Speciality Coffee Association of America’s Certified (SCAA) Home Brewer: the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YEYKK8U/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> OXO &#8211; On Barista Brain</a> nine-cup coffee maker.

<h3>Taste testing</h3>

<p>In search of the best beans overall, which can take into account many factors, we also wanted to see which were the best tasting coffee beans as well.</p>
<p>To ensure that no tester had a biased view of any cup they drank, for each test we opened a fresh bag of coffee and prepared in a separate room. Each pot of coffee was prepared based on the coffee instructions and brewed a full pot before anyone was able to have a taste. Each drinker was asked to rate the following categories on a scale of 1-10:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coffee aroma</li>
<li>Coffee taste (Drinkers were asked to taste it black before adding any cream and sugar to their cup. We asked those who mixed the coffee for further feedback on how the coffee tasted with the mix-ins.)</li>
<li>Coffee finish or aftertaste</li>
<li>Overall quality</li>
</ul>
<p>We also asked tasters to guess the brew type (light, medium or dark) and include any flavor notes before anonymously leaving their feedback to later analyze. We have a very diverse group of coffee drinkers, but most tend to drink stronger and bolder coffee. When analyzing the results, we found that the taste testers overwhelmingly liked the stronger tasting light and medium roasts, which matched their pre-testing preferences.</p>

<p>Freshly roasted and prepared in small batches, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X8NSHGU/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Verena Street &#8211; Mississippi Grogg</a> out-brewed all the other options with a warm and inviting taste our staff would love to wake up to. We found that this brew was rich and robust without being overpowering or tasting cheap.</p>
<p>Our trusty testers rated this coffee a 7.55 out of 10 on our overall testing scale. In the aroma category the coffee scored a 7.60 and received the most 10’s out of any coffee we tested. Those who like strong black coffee rated the aroma low with the thought it was going to be “fruity” or “weak,” but were pleasantly surprised with the taste. The coffee finish rated highly as well at 7.80 out of 10. Tasters specifically noted the caramel finish. Most guessed incorrectly that this was a Medium coffee roast.</p>

<p>Canadian favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YVRX5W/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tim Hortons</a> whole-bean light roast has taken the top honors for coffee brands we know and love. Our testers knew right away that this was something they “grew up with” and left additional comments including “traditional,” “classic” and “homey.” In addition, testers guessed accurately that this was a medium brew.</p>

<p>Predating the conscious-consumer movement, Tim Hortons hosted its own Coffee Partnership to help the communities where they buy their beans in Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala and Honduras. A pillar of their community outreach program is the Junior Achievement program, aimed at helping middle school kids with education.</p>
<p>Back to the coffee taste, Tim Hortons roasts their beans in small batches and claims that only three people know their secret recipe. Our testers rated the coffee finish highest in the taste test, noting that it was just a good cup of coffee. Even better, this fail-safe coffee will only put you back $.69 per ounce.</p>

<p><strong>The best light roast and whole bean coffee was our top pick, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X8NSHGU/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Verena Street &#8211; Mississippi Grogg</a>.</strong> The office chatter surrounding this taste test made it a staple on the office shopping list and is now in the rotation of coffee blends brewed. Receiving the most eight, nine and tens across the scoring board, people loved the natural hazelnut flavor found in the roast.</p>
<p><strong>The best medium roast coffee we tested was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006G7WCTI/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marley Coffee</a>, which came in third overall in our test.</strong> Marley is an organic, ethically-farmed and 100% Ethiopian blend with herbal tastes including fruity wine undertones. Our testers loved the taste and finish of this coffee and guessed it was either a light or medium blend. One tester loved the “watermelon or green tea” undertones and most mentioned the unique taste that was a welcome change in the morning. Marley Coffee ranked as the most expensive coffee we tested at $.87 per ounce. Money well spent according to our testers.</p>

<p><strong>The best dark roast was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PV4FG3Q/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koffee Kult</a> dark roast</strong>. This 100% arabica coffee blend, sourced from Colombia, Guatemala and Sumatra offers a full body and rich option for your coffee palate. Our testers knew that this was a dark coffee roast by its strong aroma, but were pleasantly surprised by the wood-fired taste. Most testers did call out the bitterness of this coffee, but pointed out that it didn&#8217;t linger and the acidity was enjoyable. Again, this winner is one of the most expensive coffees we tested at $.88 per ounce, but if you love the bold coffee taste, this is for you.</p>

<p><strong>The best ground coffee was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004DP6LQA/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New England</a> medium roast.</strong> This coffee tricked our bold coffee lovers into thinking it would be a weaker or lighter coffee, but it won everyone over with the taste and overall quality. Our tasters noted the sweet smell and smooth taste of the New England Coffee&#8217;s medium roast. An added benefit of New England’s medium roast is the price, costing a very cool $.45 per ounce, this will please both your taste buds, and your wallet.</p>

<p><strong>Coming in 5th on the list overall and 2nd on the known brands list, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JI498GG/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dunkin&#8217; Donuts</a> medium roast scored major points as a great coffee choice.</strong> Testers were all over the place wondering what kind of roast this was due to its strong aroma and bold taste. Our office testers who enjoy a bold cup of coffee ranked this very highly in taste and finish, but others listed it as harsh and acidic. One tester noted that they enjoyed the coffee more when they let it cool down and added ice to it. We loved that idea! Another wallet friendly choice, Dunkin&#8217; Donuts coffee will only cost you $.44 per ounce.</p>

<p>We couldn’t have a cheap coffee article without mentioning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZZLTR2N/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">McCafe</a> coffee! Rounding the top three, McCafe medium roast scored well among known coffee brands, but ranked seventh in our overall tasting list. Home-brewing this cup of coffee will only set you back $.50 per ounce, very reasonable and below average in cost. Our testers were split if this was either a medium or dark coffee, but either way it ranked well on quality. Our tasters also liked the balanced nature of this brew and included comments such as “bitter, but smooth” and “acidic, but fruity.”</p>
<p>There were two surprises at the bottom of our list, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004LL5O46/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Starbucks</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I8GC9E8/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maxwell,</a> which ranked lowest for brands you know, as well as our overall list. These two coffee giants both received bad scores in taste and finish categories. Comments included “overly acidic,” “slightly burnt” and “basic.” Both costs were below average per ounce. Maxwell was the least expensive coffee that we tested at $.23 and Starbucks ranked in the middle at $.55.</p>
<p>When looking at the list as a top 20 choice we noticed that the popular brands ranked surprisingly low overall. Only three in the top 10 were brands that most people have heard of. Perhaps online shopping is providing availability to more brands that can be tailored to your taste buds.</p>

<p>Our unknown brands overwhelmingly ranked high in all of the categories we tested. Our runner up for best overall coffee and unknown brands was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FTE4NEU/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cameron&#8217;s whole bean</a> light roast. Cameron’s offers drinkers another option in the sustainable and small batch category, but comes in as one of the most expensive options at $.71 per ounce. Tasters commented over and over that this was a smooth coffee and that taste wasn’t overpowering. The finish of the coffee ranked higher than any other we tested.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top ten on our overall list, and the top five in our unknown brands list, both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0189JVAD4/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Subtle Earth</a> whole bean light roast and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006CQ1ZHI/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Death Wish</a> whole bean dark roast have notable features to be considered for your new coffee of choice.</p>
<p>Subtle Earth whole bean light roast is one of the only coffees that made our list, boasting both certified organic and GMO free ingredients. You can tell the care that is taken from farming to finish when looking at the story of Don Pablo’s Subtle Earth coffee. Our tasters picked out a number of fruity and herbal flavors, but what won everyone over was the sweet finish with no added flavor in the beans. Costing you only $.53 per ounce, this flavorful cup provides more than just a boost of caffeine, it can also boost your savings.</p>
<p>Being advertised as the “world&#8217;s strongest coffee,” <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006CQ1ZHI/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Death Wish</a> whole-bean dark roast coffee is not for the faint of heart. We should mention here that this might not be considered a “cheap coffee” as it costs a very bold $1.25 per ounce, but we chose to test it as has a very large online presence and thousands of five-star reviews.</p>

<p>Our coffee testers do love a strong and bold cup of coffee, so though we expected it to rank highly, Death Wish sat in the middle of the pack due to its low marks in aroma and taste. It did gain major points for its finish though, where tasters noted that it was smooth, but had some overpowering bitterness to it. If you need a large jolt of energy with intense flavor, look no further than Death Wish coffee.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, the lesser known brands ranked higher and received more detailed tasting notes. When searching the description of these brands, you will find more information on specific origin, details in roasting and care in the small batches. The attention to detail made from the farming to the roasting will set you back a few more dollars, but know that along with a more satisfying cup of coffee you are also doing your part to better the world.</p>

<p>Making a change from your beloved coffee brand might seem like a daunting task, but considering the vast amounts of tasty, wallet-friendly and environmentally savvy options, we recommend you add the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00X8NSHGU/?tag=ybdchp-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Verena Street &#8211; Mississippi Grogg</a> to your morning routine.</p>
<p>Verena Street sells both whole-bean and ground coffee, decaf, espresso and three other roasting options that can please even the pickiest coffee drinker. We found this brand had a cost point that was right in the middle of all the brands we tested, making it a smart budgeting choice. Testers loved the sweet hazelnut aroma, the surprisingly bold flavor and the caramel finish that shot this coffee to first place in whole bean coffee, light roasted coffee and best overall taste.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent over 25 hours researching and thoroughly testing each aspect of the seven top label makers, including handheld, computer-connected and combination models. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OCEKCB2/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother &#8211; P-Touch PT-D600</a> was the clear choice for best label maker due to its easy functionality and the option to use either its keyboard or plug it into the computer. If you’re looking for a mobile option, then the handheld <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005J7Y6GS/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EPSON &#8211; LabelWorks LW-400</a> is a perfect choice as it has a bunch of one-touch features.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>In our search for the best, we went through multiple websites like Reddit, the best-seller lists on Amazon and we read and watched other reviews to see what the lifetime-users had to say. From there we found out what the most important aspects of label makers were and refined our list. With our criteria, decades spent using label makers and looking at some top choices from places like The Wirecutter, only seven ended up making the cut.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the selection process, we examined these products in a way that would best mimic normal use. For example, we used the labels on common materials like glass, plastic, cardboard and paper and placed them in the freezer and dishwasher to see if they could stand the test of time. We took into account the versatility of the label makers, their user-friendliness and other attributes that made them stand out from the pack.</p>

<h2 id="bit-about-organization">A bit about organization</h2>
<p>We all know it is important to stay organized and usually end up creating a system that works for us, but is it actually worth it? The debate continues on whether those who are organized are smarter than <a href="http://time.com/3852042/disorganized-brain-good-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those who are disorganized</a>. But, taking intelligence out of it, there is indisputably a certain peace of mind when things are organized.</p>
<p>The easiest way to stay ahead of the chaos life brings is to create a universal system wherein your stuff is labelled clearly and everything has a specific spot, even if that means a drawer for miscellaneous items. Printed labels are a great tool because they are “semi-permanent”, meaning you can change them if you really want to, but if you don’t then they are there to stay.</p>
<p>Staying organized can be scoffed at by those who dismiss its importance, but it has been found that “clutter can up your anxiety levels” (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/22/home-organization-stress-survey_n_3308575.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this was a testimonial study</a>). An easy way to reduce bad stress is to use labels to create a system that will help you stay organized.</p>
<h2 id="why-need">Why someone would need a label maker</h2>
<p>Label makers help facilitate organization by allowing you to specify where certain objects are supposed to go or keep track of what herbs are growing in your garden. Labels help create a “system of stuff”, otherwise your memory is taking on the load of knowing where everything is. So with the advent of professional-looking labels, the task of getting and staying clean becomes much easier.</p>
<p>The simplicity of label makers lets you quickly create labels that are always perfectly neat. There is no doubt you can make your own labels with some DIY tricks, but we found that using a label maker is more conducive to remaining organized because it takes no preparation to print or reprint a label. And you don&#8217;t have to spend a load of money, you can just grab a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005X9VZ70/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO LabelManager 160</a>, type something out and push ‘print’.</p>
<p>With label makers you can keep a consistent style that is much harder to maintain with handwriting. You can also set the mood of your organization with different fonts for specific needs, like a professional font for your office or a more fun one for the kids’ rooms. When you use a label maker there is no discrepancy about what it says. In short, label makers are the easiest and most effective way to make labels and stay organized.</p>

<p><strong>Labeling food</strong><br />
There are many different ways to use a label maker effectively, one of which is on food products. Ever avoid looking for that specific spice or herb you want because your cupboard is absolute chaos? We’ve all been there. Or what about when you don’t know how long ago Grandma’s special home-cooked spaghetti sauce has been in the back of the freezer? Labels have purpose (and are freezer-compatible!).</p>

<p>Alongside using labels for containers themselves, you can categorize the inside of your fridge and cupboards with them: “Fruit”, “Meat”, “Leftovers”, “Glassware”, “Bowls”, “Plates”&#8230; you can have a spot for everything and everybody is able to see what should go where. This clear compartmentalizing really holds the power to ease the mind.</p>
<p><strong>Household objects and office supplies</strong></p>
<p>Another key way to take advantage of this organizational tool is to use it for your office and house in general. You can use labels to cover the inside of all cupboards and closets for blankets, towels, toys and whatever else. Remember, starting organized is the key to staying organized.</p>
<p>You can use labels for anything that is unknown on the outside like boxes, flash drives, CDs and DVDs. Think about holiday decorations: (possibly) a disaster waiting to be organized. There is usually not a good spot to just write on big plastic containers. And if you choose to do so, then it is permanent. Although permanence is good when it comes to organization, you still want things to be able to change. That is why using label makers is perfect: you can take them off.</p>

<p>Of course the stickability is an important aspect to labels, which we’ll get to later, but the semi-permanence of labels produced from a label maker puts it way ahead of writing directly on a container. It allows your system of organization to be dynamic when it needs to be, an exquisite balance between flexibility and rigidity. For example, if you need to switch your HDMI from the XBOX to the TV you can use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B013DG2FNW/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother P-touch PT-D210</a> to easily make new cord labels.</p>
<p>More areas that can be organized with labels include office files, wires and power cords, toy boxes, sports containers, art supplies and the list goes on. A huge contributor to why label makers are so useful is because it gives off this professional aesthetic, which makes us more likely to abide by our own organizational code. On top of that, the ability to easily change the label of a container, if needed, and the capacity to quickly make up a new label allows for a near-seamless process of organization.</p>
<p><strong>Learning new languages<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This may sound a bit off the cuff but in our initial research we came across people that have used labels for everyday objects to help them learn a new language, for example before they go on a trip. It makes sense if you think about it, and usually the people who are organized enough to use a label maker are those who will plan ahead for a trip they are taking to Cabo to get those everyday necessities down.</p>

<h3>Handheld</h3>
<p>These are print-on-the-spot label makers. They are incredibly quick and easy to use. There is no other hardware or software involved, just this mini-machine you hold in your hand. You just type out what you want printed, press print and boom! Label. Though some store recent prints and have save functions, these are typically used for one or a few labels at a time.</p>
<h3>Computer plug-in only</h3>
<p>These are label makers that require a computer to use. There is no keyboard on the machine itself so you would usually keep them on your desk or close by. On most there is no requirement to download any software so that you can print within seconds of plugging them into a USB port.</p>

<p>Computer plug-in label makers are best if a lot of printing is required as they can print large volumes for things like address books and business inventory (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JIIKQ/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO LabelWriter 450 Turbo</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DSYEB28/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother PC Connectable PT-P700</a> proved to be especially valuable in these areas). And it&#8217;s the same type of deal: you just plug it in, type what you want, click print and bang! Label! Label! Label!</p>
<h3>Hybrids</h3>
<p>These are a bit more rare and incredibly versatile label makers. Just what it sounds like, it has its own keyboard which you can use to type what you want and print from there and it can be plugged into the computer. These are used for those who have multiple preferences on what they’d like printed, sometimes wanting a more elaborate, imported design and other times wanting the quick there-in-the-moment print job.</p>
<h2 id="features-to-look">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Printer Style:</strong> If you think you are the type who is going to be printing as you go then you will probably want a smaller hand-held label maker. On the flip side, if you are the type to plan out what you want to print then a computer-compatible printer may be more in line with what you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Versatility:</strong> There are a lot of attributes to look for: amount of lines, font sizes, tape width, types of tape, symbols and colors. So first step, figure out what exactly you need it for or what you may want to use it for.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> In terms of the label you should look for something that prints with your preferred resolution and sticks well to the materials you are going to use it on.</p>
<p>For the label maker, if it is impossible to change to the font you want, or the desired size, then there is little reason to buy it. We recommend you check out its rating on ease-of-use where we determined which label makers were the most-user friendly and whose software can be most easily navigated through.</p>

<p><strong>Energy source:</strong> All of the label makers we tested can use batteries (both AAA and AA) and some can be plugged in as well. The computer-compatible label makers are the ones that can be plugged in for power, some even have a lithium-ion battery inside that charges when plugged in. Another thing to keep in mind is how long these batteries can power the product.</p>
<p><strong>Tape efficiency:</strong> One of the biggest user complaints is wasted tape. This is the blank, unused tape on either side of the print on the label. So you are going to want something that either allows you to chain-print a bunch in a row, which you can then manually cut, or that allows you to minimize the amount of unused tape on each side.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6149" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape.png" alt="Printer Tape Data Chart" width="900" height="674" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape.png 991w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-610x457.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-768x575.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-300x225.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-295x221.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-885x663.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-360x270.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-375x281.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-414x310.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/printer-tape-320x240.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The cost of the tape itself is another thing to look at because, assuming you actually use the label maker, you are going to need to buy refills and a variety of types of tape. Also, the durability of the tape is involved here as the tape that lasts longer is going to be more cost-effective (though, after our testing, we’ve found that this is a minimal cost to bear in mind).</p>
<p><strong>Screen legibility:</strong> A huge part of the label-making process is the preview of the print. If you can’t see what you’ve typed and what is going to print then it becomes an ineffective guessing game. You can look for ones that are backlit and that have a big screen to best see what is going to print.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard type:</strong> Most people are used to typing on computers that have a QWERTY keyboard and unfortunately some label makers use an ABCDEF keyboard. If that doesn’t bother you then feel free to purchase whichever type, but all of our choices were QWERTY keyboards.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Initial thoughts</h3>
<p>We first used each label maker before reading any user-manual or guides just to get an initial impression (and because we figured that is what most people do anyways). This semi-subjective first impression definitely played a role in our “overall rating” of the ease of use, but was by no means the only thing considered, especially after reading the user-manuals.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6160 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals.jpg" alt="LCD color display" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pt-p600-w-manuals-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p>After getting a general feel for each label maker, and creating a general network of comparison between each one, we looked at the overall navigation of each label maker. The objective measurements included things like recording the amount of “button presses” it took to do a specific task, such as changing the font size or decreasing the amount of unused tape. We also considered the ability to save past prints and the access to a history of recently printed items.</p>
<p>Once we recorded the amount of presses for a multitude of categories we then compared them to each other. On top of that we rated how well the software was formatted, how easy it was to maneuver through and do any particular task without having to refer to the user-manual (that you will probably throw away with the box it came in). So the combination of the subjective inferences and objective efficiencies is what resulted in our overall rating on the ease of use.</p>
<h3>Versatility</h3>
<p>The versatility of the label maker refers to how many different tasks it can be used for. For this category we took into consideration nearly every aspect of the fonts and tapes possible, including the amount of lines, sizes, types, widths, colors and symbols. We basically measured how many different things the label maker could do. This will become easier to see once you look at the charts.</p>

<h3>Cost-efficiency and refills</h3>
<p>The way we determined cost-efficiency was to find cost per label. We used standard labels of both half inch and full inch widths (when applicable). And because there is no set length of tape we calculated an average cost of 10 feet of the standard label tape. We then made labels using two inches of words (the length from first letter to the last was two inches) with each label maker to incorporate the wasted tape.</p>
<p>Integrating the amount of unused tape we were able to calculate the total amount of labels that would be produced with the 10 feet of tape. So, using the cost of the tape and the total length of tape wasted per label, we determined the cost per label.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6153" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cost-efficiency.png" alt="Cost-Efficiency and Refills" width="900" height="738" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cost-efficiency.png 905w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cost-efficiency-610x500.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cost-efficiency-768x630.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cost-efficiency-300x246.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cost-efficiency-295x242.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cost-efficiency-885x726.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cost-efficiency-360x295.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cost-efficiency-375x307.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cost-efficiency-414x339.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cost-efficiency-320x262.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We also looked at the chain-printing ability on some that drastically decreased the cost per label (by over a third!). Chain-printing is used when you need the same label printed multiple times. The label maker will print your desired number in a row, without giving you time to manually cut the tape. And with this function the label maker doesn’t need the usual required amount of tape to begin printing so it lessens the overall amount of tape used by minimizing the waste.</p>
<h3>Quality of labels</h3>
<p>The quality of the labels is based primarily on their stickiness and durability. We evaluated both these qualities by putting all the standard white labels, of equal lengths, on surfaces for which they would most likely be used. These surfaces included plastic for Tupperware and containers, glass for spices, cardboard for shipping boxes and paper for folders and letters. We used both flat and curved surfaces when appropriate.</p>

<p>We then conducted a general sight test to see if any of the labels lifted on their own. After that we put some Tupperware in the freezer for two weeks to see how they held up. Next we put the Tupperware and glassware into both the microwave and dishwasher. We microwaved them for a total of 10 minutes each and ran the dishwasher five separate times after they were fully cooled.</p>
<p>After all was said and done, we peeled off each one (if they weren’t off already) to see how hard it was to pull off each label, and if it came off in one piece or not. For the labels used on the cardboard and paper we looked at how much material was taken off with the label as a more objective testament to its stickability.</p>

<p>This is where it all comes together, where the versatility, user-friendliness and overall quality of the label maker meet. Of course we all have our own desired uses and specific functions we’d like our label makers to serve, so the most multi-faceted one easily stood out. When you want to be able to print right then and there, on the spot, or import a custom symbol or picture from the internet or your phone the label maker that can do both is paramount.</p>

<p>In deciding the best overall label maker we looked at what could be done, how easy it could be done and how well it was done. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OCEKCB2/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother &#8211; P-touch PT-D600</a> was by far the best overall label maker. It can do the most out of any “standard” label maker (non-computer) with eight different font sizes and six different tape widths. It has an incredible amount of symbols within its program and can almost double the amount of lines per label as compared to the next best.</p>
<p>At first it seemed a bit big and clunky, which makes it more of a hassle to move around compared to the others, but after putting it to use the size was forgotten. It has a great chain printing function which reduces the cost of two inches of words to seven cents per label. The PT-D600 can store 99 labels inside it and is computer-compatible (both PC and Mac) which makes its storage essentially limitless. It prints barcodes and has the highest resolution at 360 dots per inch (DPI) when printing from the computer.</p>

<p>One of our favorite features is the quality of the print preview, there is no mistaking what you are about to print. It is clear and very well backlit. Also there is a great home page from which to navigate where there are a very good amount of templates to choose from (that you would actually use!). This Brother PT-D600 ended up with one of the highest scores on our user-friendliness as it was beyond easy to navigate through.</p>
<p>Another cool feature specific to this label maker was the automatic cutting. In order to get a label from all of the other label makers you had to push down a button to manually cut the label. It’s 2017, who wants to work that hard? Obviously this is not too big of a deal, but nonetheless it is still pretty cool and worth a mention.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The handheld and computer-compatible <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OCEKCB2/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother &#8211; P-touch PT-D600</a> is the most versatile label maker as it has wide-ranging capacities on the machine itself, like 600 plus symbols and six different tape widths, and can be connected to a PC or Mac where you can import images and symbols to customize your labels as you like.</li>
<li>Its print preview function is the best out there. There is a wide screen that has a white backlight allowing you to see what you are trying to print before you do.</li>
<li>The interface is very clear and provides the user with an easy-to-maneuver main menu where files and templates can be simply accessed.</li>
<li>It has a great automatic chain-printing function that cuts down the cost per label to around seven cents and contains a more-than-necessary 99 labels in storage.</li>

<h2 id="best-handheld">Best handheld: Epson &#8211; LabelWorks LW-400</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6163 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400.jpg" alt="EPSON LabelWorks LW-400" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/epson-lw-400-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The best simple label maker was a tough choice because they were all more or less scored the same in user-friendliness. But when we went through all of the comparisons, the ability to save up to 50 labels for reprinting, use a label width of ¾” and print barcodes, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005J7Y6GS/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EPSON &#8211; LabelWorks LW-400</a> became the clear winner. It can also print twice as many lines on one label (four) as its competitors in this category.</p>
<p>With over 300 symbols to choose from and one-push changes there is little to complain about. Well, actually, in the beginning it was a bit harder to get used to because it uses symbols to describe specific actions as opposed to words. So this made the learning curve a bit longer, but ultimately it allows for the quickest changes between font sizes and types, lengths and saves. This makes it incredibly easy and quick to work with.</p>

<p>Something that stood out to us was that this LW-400 will not allow you to print if the text is too long (if you’ve chosen to stray from the automatic settings). There is a nice preview of the print as well, which most of the label makers we tested have, but nonetheless became a favorite function of ours. Another useful aspect of this compact printer is the ability to print up to nine copies so you don’t have to keep pressing print for each copy.</p>
<p>And because there is a shift key it is like using a computer keyboard to input symbols on the number keys, which avoids a lot of hassle (the Brother P-touch PT-D210 has a shift key as well). The wrap-around function allows you to print a label for cables or wires with just one push of a button.</p>
<p>There is also a plethora of tapes that you can use with this label maker. And you can print in up to seven languages. One of the drawbacks is the cost of its labels. Though 12 cents per the label is not too costly (using the same standard two inches of print from beginning to end), it was one of the highest priced labels we tested.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you get used to the interface, the handheld <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005J7Y6GS/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EPSON &#8211; LabelWorks LW-400</a> has the most one-push changes that allow you to quickly switch up the label contents.</li>
<li>You can print up to four lines with this label maker due to its maximum ¾” thick tape, which is 50% bigger when compared to the other handheld options.</li>
<li>It scored near-perfect on the stickability and durability of the labels which is nice to see because the cost per our standard label (two inches of font) averages about 12 cents.</li>
<li>This was the only solely handheld option that allowed you to print barcodes for shipping.</li>

<p>When deciding which computer-compatible label maker was the best (excluding the best overall which was a hybrid) it was a bit of a toss up because each one was dominant in different categories. After much thought, we figured that someone who is buying a computer-compatible label maker is most likely going to want to use if for shipping labels, barcodes and addresses. So we crowned the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JIIKQ/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO &#8211; LabelWriter 450 Turbo</a>.<br />
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JIIKQ/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-450-turbo.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best PC-Connected: DYMO - 450 Turbo</h3><p>The DYMO LabelWriter 450 Turbo proved to be the best in the game for quick and massive prints for things like multiple addresses for letter heading as it can print at an astounding 71 labels per minute.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JIIKQ/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In terms of tape size and type, this printer has the most variety out of any we tested. All of the computer-compatible choices can link up with the address book in your computer. Plus, this DYMO 450 Turbo is really fast, allowing you to print over 70 labels per minute. Unfortunately the standard tape that came with it is not laminated so it performed terribly in the dishwasher (it was the only one whose print faded on the Tupperware and that fell off completely from the glassware).</p>
<p>Something else that was not as impressive as the other options was the software. It was harder to change certain things, for example, moving or getting rid of an imported symbol or image took many more clicks. It was as if it wouldn’t register perfectly and did not allow you to maneuver imported images seamlessly like the other softwares.</p>
<p>There were little downsides in comparison, however, as the Turbo’s labels are incredibly cost-effective and ended up being the cheapest ones we found (reminder: the unlaminated standard labels it comes with are not compatible with the dishwasher). There is very little unused tape and it can print with a resolution of 300 dots per inch.</p>
<p>Alongside the wide variety of tape sizes that are compatible with this printer (more than any other label maker we tested). The types of tape are not necessarily as flashy as the others but DYMO provides you with many durable options that are resistant to heat, cold, water and UV (that are presumably compatible with the dishwasher).</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The computer-connected <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JIIKQ/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO &#8211; LabelWriter 450 Turbo</a> provides you with the most overall choice. There are more than 10 different tape widths you can choose from.</li>
<li>The software isn’t the best but once you get the hang of it there are loads of different templates from which to choose, making it incredibly easy to customize.</li>
<li>This was the fasted printing label maker, printing more than one per second, allowing you to print out your address entire book quickly and without any more effort than setting up the print.</li>
<li>The standard non-laminated tape it came with are not dishwasher compatible and do not stick as well as the other similar labels. Nonetheless there is plenty of stick for sending out packages.</li>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6165 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-210.jpg" alt="Brother P-touch PT-D210" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-210.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-210-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-210-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-210-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-210-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-210-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-210-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-210-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-210-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-210-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B013DG2FNW/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother &#8211; P-touch PT-D210</a> was the runner up to the non-computer label maker. It is extremely clear and easy to use with a normal keyboard akin to that on a computer. The interface is as simple as it gets. There is chain-printing capability which reduces the price of an average label to about eight cents and you can also print multiple copies without chain-printing if you’d like.</p>
<p>There is an auto-store history function which was very nice to have as it allows you to reprint something you recently did without hassle. Unfortunately there are only three font sizes to choose from, but there are over 600 symbols available. As far as the non-computer competition, this PT-D210 stands out with its ability to print on labels only 1/8th of an inch, making it very useful for more detailed organizing.</p>
<h3>DYMO &#8211; LabelManager 160</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6166 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-160.jpg" alt="DYMO LabelManage 160" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-160.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-160-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-160-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-160-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-160-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-160-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-160-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-160-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-160-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-160-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>This incredibly inexpensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005X9VZ70/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO &#8211; LabelManager 160</a> can be bought for about $15 on Amazon (and its buttons have that amazing silky rubber feel to them). Even though the tape didn’t perform well on the cardboard, in all other areas it performed perfectly. So if you are just looking for something to get a quick job done and don’t want to spend more than $20 then this is your go to.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005X9VZ70/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-labelmanager-160-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-labelmanager-160-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-labelmanager-160-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-labelmanager-160-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-labelmanager-160-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-labelmanager-160-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-labelmanager-160-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-labelmanager-160-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dymo-labelmanager-160.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Quick and Cheap: DYMO - LabelManager 160</h3><p>This is the most basic label maker out there, it is very transportable and prints great labels for plastic and glassware for a small fraction of the initial cost and cost per label.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005X9VZ70/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>It is definitely a take-with-you type of label maker. However, due to its compact size, it does not have a shift key which makes attaining certain symbols on the keyboard a bit more cumbersome than it should be. On the flipside, though, the LabelManager 160 makes it beyond easy to change font size, embolden, italicize and underline, as well as print vertical labels. And if you are trying to learn a language, this DYMO has 19 to choose from.</p>
<h3>Brother &#8211; PC Connectable PT-P700</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DSYEB28/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother &#8211; PC Connectable PT-P700</a> had a tough start trying to download and install the software on a Mac, but did fine on the PC. The amount of tape-widths (and the maximum width) this label maker is compatible with, makes it more versatile than the DYMO Plug N Play. Unfortunately, the resolution is only 180 dots per inch on this computer-compatible label maker which really decreases the value of importing images.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6167 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-p700.jpg" alt="Brother PC Connectable PT-P700" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-p700.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-p700-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-p700-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-p700-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-p700-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-p700-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-p700-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-p700-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-p700-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brother-p700-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is the cost of these labels. These were the most expensive labels we tested (at about 13 cents per label&#8211;again using our standard two inches of words) because of the immutable margins, which were an inch on either side. The labels themselves did seem to hold up well in all the tests though. This is another instance where the labels used are flat, which makes them easy to peel and place.</p>
<h3>DYMO &#8211; Plug N Play</h3>
<p>Talk about easy to use. This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00464E5P2/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO &#8211; Plug N Play</a> has it in the name, it was actually plug in and go. You can print without downloading the full version (which you can do with all of the other computer-compatible label makers, but this one was exceptionally easy). However, upon downloading the full version, the recent history saved items would only keep one at a time as opposed to the option of storing many on all the other programs.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6168 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-plug-n-play.jpg" alt="DYMO Plug N Play" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-plug-n-play.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-plug-n-play-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-plug-n-play-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-plug-n-play-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-plug-n-play-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-plug-n-play-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-plug-n-play-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-plug-n-play-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-plug-n-play-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dymo-plug-n-play-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Another downside to this computer printer was its maximum tape size: half an inch. This was a bit disappointing because with such a great amount of dots per inch (300), the printer was not really able to show its full potential. And because of this lack in size, the amount and types of labels and barcodes diminishes. Nonetheless, this was an easy-as-pie label maker to work with.</p>
<p>Also, a quick note on replacing the the lithium-ion battery: it has to be purchased from DYMO and is about $25. This was one of the most common complaints from many of the review sites we checked.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>When it comes down to it, the more you can do with a label maker, the better. And when we look at the versatility and performance of the hybrid handheld and computer-compatible <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OCEKCB2/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brother &#8211; P-touch PT-D600</a>, there was really no other option. This was our top choice because it has the most options in nearly every category, is very cost effective and outperformed every other label maker in testing with six different tape widths, 600 plus symbols and a beautiful display for previewing your label.</p>
<p>The handheld <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005J7Y6GS/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EPSON &#8211; LabelWorks LW-400</a> was easy to use, could print bar codes and had great storage and proved to be a very smart handheld choice. If you want a specialty printer for address labels, stamps or barcodes then the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JIIKQ/?tag=ybdlbl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DYMO &#8211; LabelWriter 450 Turbo</a> should be your pick. Though these two and the rest of the competition could hold their own in some categories, the Brother P-touch PT-D600 was the winner as it has the best of both worlds.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected" class="collapse">How we selected mugs to test</h2>
<p>Our testers have used travel mugs daily for many years and while engaged in activities ranging from truck driving to theatrical stage management, so they had some long-standing demands and expectations. We sorted through countless published professional and consumer reviews and dove into enthusiast discussion boards to find our finalists. We’ve especially kept an eye out for online buzz about flaws and weaknesses, which we’ve tested for and noted. Value is an important consideration for items like this, and we’ve included mugs that ranged in price from $16 to $30 at the time we ordered them.</p>
<p>After our old top pick from Camelbak was discontinued, we started looking for replacements. The Burnout promised to solve all our problems with heat-retention tradeoffs, so we added it to the list. We&#8217;re watching for a new auto-seal design that&#8217;s as easy to clean as the Camelbak, but we haven&#8217;t found it yet.</p>

<h2 id="features-to-look-for" class="collapse">Features to look for</h2>
<p>There are a handful of usability factors that make the difference between your go-to travel mug companion and a dud you’d rather just leave at home. We’ve found the most important factors to be the following:</p>
<p><strong>Leak and spill protection:</strong> You should be able to use a travel mug without fear of spills on your lap or in your backpack.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of opening:</strong> If you want to enjoy a hot beverage while driving, one-handed operation is as much a safety feature as a convenience.</p>
<p><strong>Mess avoidance:</strong> All spouts and lids will collect some liquid while you’re drinking (flip-open lids tend to be the worst in this regard), so in our usability table we’ve rated how safe they are around white silk shirts.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of cleaning:</strong> Nobody wants to use a mug they can’t get clean.</p>
<p><strong>Heat retention:</strong> Hot drinks like your coffee or tea should stay pleasantly hot.</p>
<p><strong>Cup holder/single-brewer compatible:</strong> For those looking for compatibility with a single-cup coffee brewer, we’ve noted which mugs are seven inches or shorter (typical height for a single-cup brewer when the drip tray is removed; your machine may vary), and whether a “shorty” model (usually in 12 oz capacity) is available.</p>
<p><strong>Durability:</strong> Drops happen. A winning travel mug can survive the accidental fall from the top of your car as you absentmindedly back down the driveway on a hectic Monday morning.</p>
<h3>Notes for tea and pour-over brewing</h3>
<p>If you want a built-in loose-leaf-infuser option: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VG761C/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi</a> all sell tea-steeping versions of the mugs we tested here (or snap-in accessories) that might help you out, but we’ve been happy with the convenience of drop-in or basket infusers.</p>
<p>Both loose-leaf tea drinkers and pour-over coffee geeks should note mouth-width before they buy: we found the necks of the Klean Kanteen, Thermos Direct Drink and Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 were too small to take any but the narrowest tea infusers; the Hario V60 pour-over coffee brewer just fits the mouth of the Thermos.</p>
<h3>Why are they all stainless steel?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5461" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors.jpg" alt="stainless steel cup interiors" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stainless-steel-cup-interiors-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Most heat from your mug (once you put a lid on it) is lost through conduction, and the material that conducts the least is nothing at all — hard vacuum. Keeping a vacuum inside the wall of a mug requires a material that’s stiff and strong: steel is stiff, strong, easy to work, and economical. Most of the steel mugs tested specify “18/8 grade” steel or SAE/AISI “304 Stainless”, which contains approximately 18% chromium and 8% nickel. 304 is one of the most widely used alloys in the world (for everything from cookware to the DeLorean to the Gateway Arch) because of its versatility and stain resistance, so there’s a good chance the mugs that don’t specify an alloy are using it or something very similar.</p>
<p>In a strong bath of citric acid, 304 will release slightly more chromium than other alloys do, but for beverage use 304 stainless is as inert as any other stainless alloy, and none of us tasted any unusual metallic flavors in these mugs (even after we left hot orange juice in our top picks for a few hours). If you’re sensitive to trace amounts of nickel or chrome and you drink extra-acidic tea or coffee, consider the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 (which was nearly our favorite and is “non-stick” lined).</p>
<p>It’s probably worth noting here: all these manufacturers specify that they use BPA-free plastics.</p>
<h3>Non-steel mugs</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5462" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo.jpg" alt="ceramic Ello mug with stainless steel mugs behind" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ceramic-mug-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We included one non-steel mug in our lineup, the Ello &#8211; Mesa double-wall ceramic mug. We looked at other popular ‘reusable to-go cup’ designs, but none of them had spill-proof lids or insulating properties that would make them competitive in this line-up. (Some issues, like reports of a smelly latex rubber lid on one popular brand, or lids that were difficult to snap on, made our choice not to test even easier.)</p>
<p>The Mesa does keep your drink hot three times longer than a conventional open-top single-wall ceramic mug (an hour above 140°F instead of 15 minutes), but the sliding closure on the lid did not prevent spills.</p>
<p>While some manufacturers of the stainless steel mugs say you can put them in the dishwasher, the microwave is territory held securely by mugs like the Mesa: we microwaved water to a piping-hot 186°F and were happy to find that the outside of the mug was only a pleasantly-warm 93°F, unlike some ceramic mugs that get insanely hot on the outside when nuked.</p>
<p>So, if you are simply looking for slightly better insulation in a ceramic tumbler that can go in the microwave and the dishwasher, the Mesa is worth considering; if you want to stop spills and keep your drink hot for a long commute, read on.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested" class="collapse">How we tested</h2>
<p>Well on our way to developing permanent caffeine dependence after our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-french-press/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French Press</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-single-cup-coffee-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Single-Cup Coffee Maker</a> reviews, we indulged another caffeine binge as we filled, drained, cleaned and tried to break 13 travel mugs for multiple weeks.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>

<p>The ability to put a travel mug in your bag without fear of making book-and-computer soup separates the best of the travel mugs from the rest. It’s easy to say “this lid locks in the closed position so it won’t leak!” but some locks are easy to defeat accidentally (Contigo West Loop, we’re looking at you). To say without equivocation that the best mugs won’t leak, we put all the mugs in a duffle bag that spent half an hour inside an industrial dryer.</p>
<p>The mugs were filled, dried carefully, weighed, wrapped in a towel and sealed in an individual bag. Then the seals on each mug were double-checked by shaking (all passed) and dropping them before we put them in the dryer. We started the spin-cycle, checked once at ten minutes, then again at the 30-minute mark. All leaks were clearly visible, and we weighed the mugs again after taking them out of their bags to see how much water had leaked out.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48</a>, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H4LUMUA/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Klean Kanteen</a> leaked nothing in the half-hour they were tossed around inside the dryer. The Forge, without any lock or back-up mechanism to keep the seal from opening, only let out a single drop that we could see on its towel-wrap at the ten minute mark, and we didn’t see any more evidence of leaks at the end (nor could we measure the amount of water that had escaped.)</p>
<h3>Spill test</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5464" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test.jpg" alt="ceramic Ello in a spill test" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ello-spill-test-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Another important duty of a travel mug is stopping spills. Some of our testers have worked in locations where only spill-proof mugs are allowed, and far too many of us have experienced the tragic consequences of using unworthy mugs in moving vehicles or at desks covered with important documents.</p>
<p>We simulated a desk-spill by filling each mug halfway with a measured amount of water, then tipping it on its side (spout down). After 15 seconds, we picked up the mug and re-checked the amount of water to determine how much water spilled. We wanted to be sure we were simulating a real-world spill: a lid or seal you can manually close might be great for throwing in a bag, but the spills that matter are the ones that happen while the lid/lock isn’t closed. (Note: we tested the Ello &#8211; Mesa both opened and closed. It spilled so much while it was supposed to be “sealed” we included that number on the chart.)</p>
<p>The self-sealing mugs practically cheat on the spill test, and that’s why we like them. Of the mugs that spilled nothing when knocked over, also note that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Forge</a> has a lid design which prevents it from rolling off your desk.</p>

<p>Keeping a mug clean is one of those tasks that makes the difference between “buy it for life” and trashing an expensive mug in disgust. Our rating here is based on hand-washing with a sponge, scrubber or bottle-brush, but we’ve also noted if the manufacturer says you can put the whole mug in the dishwasher.</p>
<p>We tested how easy it is to effectively field-clean the mugs with a method similar to systems used by metallurgists looking for cracks in airframes: a (non-toxic, water-based) fluorescent paint was poured into the mugs and then out through the drinking spout. Next, the mugs were filled with soapy water, agitated, drained through the spout, and rinsed in the same way.</p>
<p>While the paint came out in our simple rinse procedure without any obvious dribbles or droplets remaining in most cases (there was a tiny drop left inside the Klean Kanteen’s three-piece seal), we did spot some residue left behind on all the mugs under a UV inspection light.</p>

<p>The Contigo Autoseal system is great for convenient spill-free sipping, but its springs and levers are immersed in your pumpkin-spice foam and nutmeg sprinkles.</p>
<p>The hinged-lid Thermos and Zojirushi mugs are pretty easy to clean, with the Thermos Direct Drink taking an edge here because of a vent design that&#8217;s a hole rather than a tube.</p>
<p><strong>Some notes on dishwasher compatibility</strong></p>
<p>All of the lids for these mugs (with the exception, inexplicably, of the OXO Good Grips) are guaranteed safe for top-rack dishwasher cleaning. Some also guarantee that the body of the mug will be okay on the top rack, but only if it’s an unpainted stainless steel body — a mark against the Auto-Seal Transit’s silicone grip design. Stanley and Bubba are both willing to back up their mugs in dishwasher use despite paint and plastic accessories; the hammertone paint looks OK, but the plastic rings on the Bubba seem destined to trap dishwater over time.</p>
<p>While we wouldn&#8217;t recommend daily dishwashing of these mugs (the extreme heat expands and contracts the steel along the seams that keep the vacuum in, which is why many manufacturers say it voids their warranty). If you want to be able to throw it in the top rack every once in awhile for a deep-cleaning, though, it&#8217;s encouraging to know that a company has your back even if the vacuum fails after ten or twenty years.</p>
<h3>Heat retention test</h3>

<p>We ran two tests to measure how well these mugs retain heat. The first test gives a broad overview of mug performance when starting with water at typical restaurant serving temperature; the second test shows how our favorite mugs performed when starting with a lower temperature.</p>
<p><strong>High-temperature heat retention</strong></p>
<p>In the first test we poured very hot water (it was a lot of pouring, so starting temperature varied, but we’ve normalized the differences to show loss from a 185°F starting temperature) into all the mugs and checked the temperature after an hour. Results are in the main table above.</p>
<p>We found that all of the mugs, even the air-insulated Ello &#8211; Mesa, will keep your Starbucks coffee hot enough to be ‘drinkable’ after sitting around for an hour. Not only that, <strong>two of the mugs we tested kept beverages hot enough to burn you</strong>. We want to point out that this kind of test obscures some basic usability complaints that are frequently made in comments about award-winning mugs: they keep boiling-hot coffee so hot that you may need to take extra steps in order to drink it. Some mug-owners on Reddit suggest ice cubes — no, that’s not a joke, <em>ice cubes</em> — to get your fresh cup of hot coffee or tea down to a drinkable temperature.</p>

<p>The Redditors were absolutely right: when we made tea with freshly-boiled water in either of the top two insulation performers (the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 or the Thermos Direct Drink Insulated Bottle) we found that it won’t be cool enough for most people to drink (below 155°F) until an hour later, even if you leave the lid off completely.</p>
<p>Mugs like these are great if you want to keep drinks hotter for longer. Just be sure you cool your coffee or tea before adding to the mug, or pour out your beverage to drink until temperatures inside the mug have reached a safe level.</p>
<p>Studies show that the severity of burns start getting significantly worse at temperatures above 175°F, so temperature curves between 200°F and 175°F aren’t showing anything but a danger zone. A study published in the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08814.x/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Journal of Food Science</em></a> shows that most people will mix cream/milk (or colder coffee) into their hot coffee to bring it down to around 140°F if they’re going to drink it immediately. Further, the Specialty Coffee Association of America cupping and tasting protocols recommend that evaluation of flavor should not begin until coffee has cooled to between 160 &#8211; 140°F.</p>

<p>With that in mind, our second test used water heated to only 167°F. We filled five mugs: three top-ranked in our first heat test, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak &#8211; Forge</a>, and a heavy, 18 oz-capacity open-top ceramic mug as a control.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes, 50ml of water was decanted from each mug into a 100 ml pyrex beaker every 15 minutes. With a bench thermometer and K-type probe, we took eight samples from each mug, leaving a slightly larger sample at the end. This controls for the way most of us drink away the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water#Heat_capacity_and_heats_of_vaporization_and_fusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific heat capacity</a> of the water in our travel mugs if we sip periodically over the course of a commute or while working at a desk.</p>
<p>The best and worst performance in this test still correspond roughly to what we saw the first test we ran, but it does show that even in this less-generous scenario the Forge can keep coffee in the “comfortably hot” zone all the way up to two hours, though it’s 15°F cooler than the Thermos. That’s longer than any of us likes to keep the same mug of coffee around, so we’re more than satisfied. (Any insulated mug is also far, far better than a ceramic open-top mug, which lost the same amount of heat in less than 20 minutes.)</p>
<h3>Drop test</h3>

<p>Other than falling off a desk, the most likely accident a mug will endure is falling off the roof of a car or truck. We subjected the mugs to a battery of drop tests to give a real-world worst-case assessment of what will happen when you forget which pocket your keys are in and set your mug on the car’s roof “just for a second.”</p>
<p>We included a drop onto a padded surface in our leak test earlier, and all of the mugs escaped that without damage (most didn&#8217;t even leak).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5454" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids.jpg" alt="cracked lids from the drop test" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cracked-lids-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>In the first part of our (more destructive) drop test, nearly all the mugs also survived falling from desk height onto concrete with only some road rash. The exception is the the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48, which cracked badly enough that the lock is only barely holding together.</p>
<p>We carried on dropping the mugs from higher and still higher heights, eliminating mugs that were too broken to be usable. The eight-foot drop cracked five of the remaining eleven mugs. After the ten-foot drop, one more (the Thermos Direct Drink) was eliminated. We’ve separated those mugs still working into “indestructibles” which look the same as they did after the first drop, and “juggernauts” which still do their jobs perfectly, but bear cracks or other deformation beyond scuffs or scrapes. The Forge, for example, shows obvious signs of fracture on one arm of the carabiner loop — it doesn’t flex or bend, though, and the seal mechanism functions as before.</p>

<p>Two of the mugs we tested kept heat inside so well, they actually made it difficult to test what we considered “normal” use because we had to dump extra cold half-and-half or ice cubes in so that we could drink from them without suffering burns. Make no mistake, this almost-magical feat is surely appreciated by those who want to drink a hot cup of home-brewed coffee eight hours after they pour it.</p>
<p>We’ve picked the The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a> (sometimes called Direct Drink) bottle as our favourite for that kind of use, since it was slightly easier for us to clean and it didn’t rattle around in our cupholders as much as the skinny Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 did. Bloomberg called this &#8220;the best mug for heat freaks” and we concur with that assessment: this mug stayed 15°F hotter than lesser mugs even when we were pouring the heat away in our 165-minute “sipping test.”</p>

<p>The Thermos performed flawlessly in our leak test, sealing its lid tight and locking with a back-up mechanism. It doesn’t seal itself every time you set it down, the way our top pick does, so you have to either close the top every time you sip or invite spills — but if you do knock it over with the lid open, it won’t spill as much as most of the other mugs we tested.</p>
<p>The Thermos &#8211; Sipp started developing a crack in the eight-foot fall. While that’s not nearly as durable as the CamelBak &#8211; Forge, the Thermos is much tougher than the other best-insulating mug, the Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48 (which probably won’t close anymore if you drop it onto concrete). The Thermos is also entirely dishwasher-safe and easy to hand-wash, and has a handy loop on the back of the lid that makes it easy to carry around.</p>
<p>Note: This is one of the more confusingly-named products we researched — it’s sometimes called things like “Sipp Stainless Insulated Drink Bottle” and is nearly identical to the “Commuter Bottle.” Whatever the name, we liked it.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>

Contigo is now one of the most prolific brands in the travel mug market, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Auto-Seal Transit</a> is the best model in their line.</p>
<p>Auto-sealing mugs like the transit are perfect for use at your desk, around fussy librarians or while driving. It&#8217;s basically impossible to spill anything from this mug while you&#8217;re drinking from it, and the spout prevents drips from gathering the way they will in flip-top designs.</p>
<p>Contigo mugs represent what really has become the baseline for travel mug functionality: To beat Contigo at their own game, a mug must be easy to drink from with one hand while still preventing spills, must be easier to clean, stay hot for longer, and take more abuse. The now-discontinued Camelbak &#8211; Forge was the only model that was better overall (still losing in heat retention), while the Thermos &#8211; Sipp has much better heat retention but doesn&#8217;t stop spills.</p>
<p>The Transit survived our ten-foot drop test with only a superficial crack in the easily-removed spout-cover. That cover is an interesting perk; a quick turn covers up the drinking spout to keep dirt out. It&#8217;s a nice perk that doesn&#8217;t get in the way when you don&#8217;t need it.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-150x150.png" data-srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-150x150.png 150w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-425x425.png 425w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-295x295.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-360x360.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-375x375.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-414x414.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit-320x320.png 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/contigo-transit.png 500w" width="150" height="150" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Safe Sipping: Contigo - Transit</h3><p>A great mug from a trusted brand that's highly durable and spill resistant. A great choice if you don't mind sacrificing heat performance and if you're OK with hand-washing.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Auto-Seal mechanism is unmatched at stopping knock-down spills, but the Transit gave up a teaspoon worth of liquid in our 30-minute tumble test. That&#8217;s a good result, but not as good as the bank-vault seal on the Thermos &#8211; Sipp. If you want to stash a mug in your bag this is not a bad pick, but we wouldn&#8217;t take it on an all-day trip with a full load of coffee inside a backpack.</p>
<p>In our temperature test, the Transit only lost 34°F of heat in the first hour, while the base-model Contigo &#8211; West Loop lost 40, so the minimal price difference is far less significant than the performance gap. That&#8217;s still a major difference from the Thermos and Zojirushi mugs, which lost less than half as much heat in the same time. The Transit&#8217;s result is in line with other good wide-mouth mugs that you can fit a sponge into, but it&#8217;s not amazing.</p>
<p>One failing of Contigo&#8217;s design is the seal mechanism: it&#8217;s a pain to clean. If you have a dishwasher or only drink clear tea, you&#8217;ll probably never have a problem with this, but you&#8217;ll still want to double-check that nothing gets stuck in the springs and levers inside this lid. The Transit&#8217;s lid is the only part you should put in the dishwasher, but the body isn&#8217;t difficult to hand wash.</p>
<p>On the whole, this is a great mug with a long heritage of good design. The price is right at about $15, and if you ever need to drink your coffee in a place where spills would be a disaster this is an excellent choice.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal Transit is easy to use for one-hand-sipping without leaving you vulnerable to spills.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking for an affordable mug that won&#8217;t break quickly, the Transit is very good on both counts.</li>
<li>Clean-up is the only weakness in this design: The springs that seal the spout are immersed in your drink, and can&#8217;t be removed for washing.</li>
<li>For secure carry in a bag the Transit was better than most, but it did leak a teaspoon worth after half an hour in a spin-cycle.</li>

<p>From a startup company founded by rocket scientists, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DJS1LHN/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Burnout termperature regulating travel mug</a> is one of the few new products that&#8217;s trying something different. We bought this mug for our 2019 update.</p>
<p>Burnout pulls the heat out of your drink in the first minute after you pour. This neat trick is accomplished with a layer of wax that&#8217;s inside the mug&#8217;s stainless steel walls. Once the wax melts, it&#8217;ll help keep all of that heat inside the vacuum-insulated chamber, even as you drink your favorite hot beverage away.</p>
<div id="visualizer-19338-1989054302" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-19338"></div>
<p>The problem with the heat-sucking material inside the Burnout is that it&#8217;s too good at its job.  If the mug starts at around room temperature, hot coffee (at just below an ideal brewing temperature of 190-200°F) will cool to 140 in fifteen minutes. If you like warm coffee instead of hot coffee, that&#8217;s probably ideal.</p>
<p>You can get a bump in heat if you take the time to boil some extra water and dump that in the Burnout for a few minutes before you add your beverage. (Pre-heating with 110°F tap water does basically nothing.)  Boiling extra water isn&#8217;t such an inconvenience for pour-over, french press and tea drinkers, but it&#8217;s a big hassle if you&#8217;re relying on a coffeemaker like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-keurig/">our favorite Keurig</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, pre-heating with boiling water also cancels out the safety goal of this mug, since the temperature is still at a scalding 172 after thirty minutes and takes two hours to hit our preferred 155. Yes, you can pre-heat for a shorter time and add milk to fine-tune the temperature, but you can do the same with our top heat-retention pick, the Thermos &#8211; Sipp, by adding an ice cube when you pour your coffee.</p>
<p>Even if a hot-ish 135°F sound perfect to you, the biggest problem with the Burnout is the lid. This design uses an internal stopper that seals a sippy-cup spout (very much like the Contigo Autoseal designs) but with a sliding, locking toggle switch instead of a push-to-drink system. This means you don&#8217;t get automatic sealing when you stop drinking, but it&#8217;s still difficult to clean out all of the springs and levers on the inside. It can also spit out drips when you close it.</p>
<p>Worse still, even when the stopper is in the closed position, it leaks. It&#8217;ll keep dribbles from coming out if you turn it upside down, but as soon as you drop it on the floor or shake it around it&#8217;ll let drips out. The slider switch is fairly easy to use, but it&#8217;s also vulnerable to getting bumped open inside a bag; this mug did poorly in our tumble test.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the price. If you&#8217;ve been waiting and waiting for a travel mug that would give four-hour warmth without burning your tongue, maybe $100 doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot. Compared to our other mugs, though, that&#8217;s a pretty crazy price.</p>
<p>We love the idea of this mug, but the concept just hasn&#8217;t been executed well enough to justify this price tag. If it were dishwasher safe and had a bomb-proof seal like the Thermos, maybe the price tag and fiddly work required to plan a perfect pre-heat routine would be worth it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HYOGTTG/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zojirushi &#8211; SM-SA48</a> has received so many accolades from reviewers, it’s hard to imagine a review that excludes it. This mug is the state of the art in vacuum insulation performance from a company with a long history of designing great food and drink containers. That said, the diminutive SA48 was so narrow and tall that it rattled around in our cupholders (and was hardest to clean inside, even with a bottle brush).</p>
<p>We also included the SA48’s sibling, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01077GFV8/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YAE48</a>, which is specifically marketed as a “Travel Mug” and seems designed to address concerns about cup holder size and the height restriction imposed by single-cup coffee machines. The wide mouth means that the YAE48 is easier to get a kitchen sponge into when cleaning, but it sacrifices insulation and leak-proof performance with that giant lid (which actually unscrewed from the body during our spin-cycle bag-leak test).</p>
<p>Neither mug is especially durable; the SA48’s lid shattered on a desk-height drop and the YAE48 wouldn’t stay closed after an eight-foot drop split it across the lock. The warranty on these mugs is also limited to insulation performance for five years, which is disappointing when the lids and locks have this many intricate parts.</p>
<h3>Contigo &#8211; Auto-Seal West Loop</h3>
<p>This is the third version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Auto-Seal West Loop</a> design, now easier to clean than old models, and with a lock button. Sadly, the lock doesn&#8217;t prevent leaks and it&#8217;s still immersing springs in your drink.</p>
<p>The West Loop is a good mug, but the Transit is more durable and holds heat better. The only trade-off is that the Transit sacrifices dishwasher compatibility because of the silicone grip. The West Loop&#8217;s insulation is guaranteed to be safe in the dishwasher, but if you buy a painted model you can count on flaking and peeling of the finish after a few months cleaning it that way.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5470 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo.jpg" alt="Klean Kanteen mug on a white counter" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/klean-kanteen-solo-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We included the winner from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">insulated water bottle review</a>, the Klean Kanteen, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H4LUMUA/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">but in a 16 oz. size</a> to match the other mugs and with the manufacturer’s leak-proof “café cap.” (We did not include the Hydro Flask in our line-up; in our water-bottle test the 32 oz Hydro Flask didn’t insulate as well as a 20 oz Klean Kanteen, and while the flip-cap lid on the Hydro Flask is easier to use with one hand, it has all of the problems of the other drip-flip lids we tested).</p>
<p>The Klean Kanteen is still a drink container we like, but it’s not easy to open and close with one hand (and in fact took a fair bit of effort to open with two hands), and it has more parts to disassemble for cleaning than any of the other mugs.</p>
<h3>Thermos &#8211; Stainless King Travel Mug</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5471 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug.jpg" alt="solo of Thermos King stainless mug" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/thermos-mug-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Thermos is the oldest and best-known name in insulated drink containers in the western world (“thermos” became such a prevalent word that US courts ruled it was legal to use as a generic term for insulated bottles in 1963). We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DZQT0E2/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Stainless King Travel Mug</a> along with our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>.</p>
<p>The King is available with a handle, which may appeal to those who keep a mug in the cold and pick it up with bare hands, but we found that a trigger-action mug like our top pick was even better since we could carry it and take drinks from it even with gloves on. The twist-action closure on the Stainless King wasn’t really designed to open and close with one hand, and requires disassembly if you want to put it in the dishwasher.</p>
<h3>Stanley &#8211; Classic</h3>
<p>We’ve included this self-sealing mug, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VG761C/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stanley &#8211; Classic</a>, which only comes in their retro-lunchbox-style “hammertone” finish, as the only painted mug guaranteed dishwasher safe; the paint does seem thick and durable, and we haven&#8217;t seen reports of it chipping or peeling the way the Contigo paint does. The functionality is generally good, but it wasn’t even as leak-proof as the Contigo mugs were. The spring on the trigger-button of this mug was also much, much stronger than the other self-sealing designs, which was a big turn-off for some testers (and didn’t keep it from leaking at all). The design also had more parts to keep track of than the other self-sealing mechanisms.</p>
<h3>Bubba &#8211; Hero Elite</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186EP0JW/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bubba</a> was included because it has the highest price to consumer rating ratio of any of the mugs we found, and the ceramic liner is a unique feature. While on the whole this mug seems a decent value, that liner didn’t prove to be an asset in any way we could find, and the way the lid collects drips and spreads them around is just annoying. The fact that the plastic ring which attaches the lid to the body just popped off in our eight-foot drop test makes us wonder how long it would take for grime and water to start collecting at that joint (even in normal use).</p>
<h3>Timolino &#8211; Icon</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0038XKF60/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Timolino &#8211; Icon</a> won top marks from <em>Cook’s Illustrated</em>, and it performed well in our cleaning and drop tests, but the drip-flip lid is a serious annoyance that was also noted by Amazon reviewers. While it didn’t break, this mug did leak around the seal every time we looked at it funny, so we wouldn’t put it anywhere near a computer bag.</p>
<h3>OXO Good Grips- SSDWTM</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-01/the-best-spill-proof-travel-mug-for-every-professional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XF97OTI/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this OXO mug</a> quite difficult to destroy. Dropping it three times from ceiling height before giving up. We like its durability, but the push-button lid is the only one we tested that isn’t dishwasher safe, and it traps a good quantity of fluid in the spout even after it’s closed, which makes it messy to drink from.</p>
<h3>The discontinued champion: CamelBak &#8211; Forge</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5467 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge.jpg" alt="the CamelBak - Forge on a table" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/camelbak-forge-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><strong>Ed: the Camelbak &#8211; Forge was discontinued in 2018, and we&#8217;re sad to say that it hasn&#8217;t been replaced with an equivalent design. Our original review is preserved here for posterity.</strong><br />
The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EPGMZZS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CamelBak &#8211; Forge</a> is as smart as it is tough. The mechanism for opening and sealing the spout whenever you pull the “trigger” is simple and effective, and the Forge practically turns itself inside out for you when you need to clean it. (Even replacing the o-ring for the seal would be trivial.)</p>
<p>The Forge keeps your drink hot for a very long time; not as long as some of the mugs we tested, but well within the expected performance of a vacuum-insulated travel mug with a wide-mouth opening. Mugs with narrower openings (like our runner-up pick below) will keep the heat for longer, but that makes them harder to clean and fill.</p>
<p>In our leak test, the Forge did leave evidence that it had let out a single drop when we checked at 10 minutes into the half-hour spin-cycle test; no further leaks were found at the end of the test, and the amount lost didn’t register on our electronic kitchen scale.</p>
<p>The Forge doesn’t have a way to lock out its trigger the way Contigo’s latest designs do, but CamelBak has shaped a loop at the back of the lid that totally protects the trigger from basically anything other than your finger. It’s possible that some object of the right shape could press on it in just the right circumstances, but on the spin-cycle leak test the Forge was far more effective than the other self-sealing mugs (even the ones with locks).</p>
<p>What’s more, the loop is a convenient way to clip the Forge onto a backpack, bike bag, or just to hook a finger through, and it also prevents it from rolling if it’s knocked over. (That means it won’t just stop you from spilling coffee: it’ll also save you from that embarrassing conversation where you have to ask your coworkers if they’ve seen a mug rolling around on the floor.)</p>

<p>CamelBak has catered to the outdoor enthusiast crowd for decades, and has a great reputation for warranty work and customer service. They guarantee this mug for life against defects in the workmanship or materials, which doesn’t strictly cover things like worn rubber o-rings or driving over it with a cement truck, but when we looked for comments on repair services we found that CamelBak is often very generous.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line" class="collapse">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Caffeine keeps us alert, awake, and energized. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0160LEYFY/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; Transit</a> ensures that it will also go into your mouth, not onto your lap or computer. The easy-to-sip-from self-sealing design make it a clear winner for most uses, though it doesn&#8217;t have the best heat retention.</p>
<p>If you like your drinks at tongue-scalding temperatures, consider the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybdtmug-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp</a>, which keeps boiling water too hot to drink for an hour, even with the lid off. The Thermos is also easier to clean than most mugs. It will spill if you knock it over with the lid flipped up, but when it’s locked you can rest assured it won’t come open in your bag.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After over a month of research and testing, we found Stillpoint Aromatics to be the best essential oils based on factors such as scent, farming and production, and storage practices.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur writer and researcher for this article is a holistic health practitioner studying nutrition, human anatomy, physiology, spirituality, as well as aromatherapy. After over a month of research and evaluation, we determined <a href="https://stillpointaromatics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stillpoint Aromatics</a> offers the best essential oils. They source the finest plants and make the greatest effort to preserve the oils’ pristine quality by keeping them in cold storage, capped with nitrogen. Running a close second — and for half the price — <a href="http://www.floracopeia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floracopeia&#8217;s</a> essential oils smelled very fresh and quite similar to Stillpoint’s, but lacked the energetic quality from our top pick.</p>

<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-found">How we found the best essential oils</h2>
<p>After several weeks of exhaustive research, we sifted the Internet to find as many essential oil brands as possible that were available in America. We searched through web retailers, scoured essential oil and natural health blogs, online forums and reviews, along with searching through Subreddits like /r/essentialoils and /r/aromatherapy.</p>
<p>We then spoke with professionals in the business including a Clinical Registered Aromatherapist, several massage therapists and a Holistic Health Coach. In addition we read through scientific research studies, and numerous essential oil, natural health and aromatherapy books — both historical and modern.</p>
<p>Finally, with a clear understanding of exactly what makes a great essential oil, we combed through our large list of candidates — plus found a few more companies of high integrity — to see if they truly met the demanding criteria for quality.</p>
<p>With this knowledge we selected a total of seven different brands to test in-house:</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-seven-best">Compare the best essential oil companies</h2>
[table id=34 /]
<h2 class="collapse">What are essential oils?</h2>
<p>The term, “essential oil” is actually the shortening of a historical term: “quintessential oil,” alluding to the oils as the spirit or life force of the plant. Of course the oils are a physical substance, not supernatural; however, their ethereal aromas and therapeutic talents can have a spiritual, as well as a mental/emotional effect on us.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.naturalhealthyconcepts.com/2014/12/04/essential-oils-fda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential oils are in fact NOT oils at all</a>, they’ve simply acquired that name because they do not mix with water, just like regular oils. They are a vital liquid present inside living plants — a natural solution of various complex chemical constituents. <strong>Scientifically, essential oils are concentrated aromatic volatile plant compounds</strong> <strong>(‘volatile’ meaning they can change state or evaporate very easily).</strong> They are mostly derived from the flowers, leaves, stems and fruits of plants, while some are extracted from the bark and even the sap of trees.</p>
<p>Inside the living plant, essential oils serve several purposes, one of which is defense. Acting like the plant’s immune system, the oils help it fight off fungus or bacterial infection, and protect it from insects and animals. Another purpose is reproduction; the pleasing aromas attract pollinating insects like bees and butterflies. We’re not the only animals who like the smell of flowers.</p>
<h2 class="collapse">How are essential oils produced?</h2>
<p>The most common processes for extracting the essential oils from the plant material after harvesting are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distillation &#8211; steam from boiling water passes through plants drawing out the oils, then the oils are separated from the cooled, re-condensed water</li>
<li>Expression &#8211; (also called cold pressing) heavy pressure squeezes the oils from the materials; used mainly with citrus fruit peels<br />
Maceration/Distillation &#8211; the plant material is softened in warm water to release the oils</li>
<li>The amount of essential oil present within the plant material is scarce, more so for some plants than others. <strong>It can take up to 60 roses to produce one single drop of rose essential oil.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="collapse" id="essential-oils-vs">Essential oils vs. absolutes vs. hydrosols</h2>
<p>When searching for and purchasing essential oils from reputable companies you might come across the terms “absolute” and “hydrosol” often right next to the essential oils of the same plant. Be aware, these are not the same as essential oils.</p>
<p>An absolute is a fragrant liquid that is extracted from the plants using chemical solvents, like alcohol. Though the solvents are removed after the extraction process, there still remains a tiny amount of the chemical in the final product. Absolutes are much thicker and more concentrated than essential oils, and because of this they are often used in skin care products and lotions.</p>
<p>A hydrosol is simply the aromatic water that is left over from the steam distillation process. Hydrosols are basically just scented H2O and are generally used as perfume, cologne, air or fabric freshener, or they can be added to a soothing bath.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="benefits">Benefits of essential oils and aromatherapy</h2>
<p>Aromatherapy is an ancient practice of natural healing and plant medicine that has been documented in human civilizations around the world for over 6,000 years. The use of prescribing aromatic plant extracts for massage, for bathing and for mental, emotional and spiritual imbalances has proven benefits through both practical and scientific evidence.</p>
<p>The scents and the therapeutic capacities of each essential oil are unique to each plant and can have many physiological and psychological benefits. The oils have the ability to calm and release stress, to uplift depression, to stimulate and awaken the body and mind, to relieve sore muscles, or even loosen a cough if used correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Aromatherapy does not literally take away stress or depression, but rather it balances the disturbances within your body and mind, and fortifies your weaknesses, allowing your body to heal itself.</strong></p>
<p>And since the oils have anti-viral, anti-fungal and antibacterial qualities within the plants, we as humans can also make use of these benefits for our own health. Again, of course, when used properly.</p>
<p>It’s very important to keep in mind that the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates essential oils mainly as cosmetics, NOT as therapeutic supplements, herbs or medications. So if you come across an essential oil company or salesperson who claims their oils can cure certain diseases or mental illnesses, they are violating federal law and can be prosecuted and fined by the US government.</p>
<p>One very public example of this came in September of 2014 when <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2014/ucm415809.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FDA cited both dōTERRA</a> and <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2014/ucm416023.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Young Living</a>, multi-level marketing essential oil companies. FDA agents found clear evidence that some of Young Living and dōTERRA reps were making claims that their oils could prevent and cure Ebola and many other illnesses! The situation was quickly remedied.</p>
<p>Such bold claims should raise red flags for wise buyers. Be a smart consumer.</p>

<p>Essential oils can be considered, fundamentally, as medication. Although derived from plants and natural resources they are still used as a treatment for health ailments. The oil’s high concentration makes them very powerful and potentially dangerous substances if used incorrectly. It is imperative that you do thorough research before using any essential oil because if used improperly they can cause serious health issues like allergic reactions, rashes, burns and long-term internal damage. The temptation to self-diagnose and self-prescribe can be a great influence in using essential oils, but without professional diagnosis and supervision, you run a risk of causing yourself harm. With that in mind here are some very important guidelines to follow:</p>
<p><strong>Avoid use of essential oils (unless under medical supervision) if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You are pregnant</li>
<li>You have a skin condition</li>
<li>You have asthma</li>
<li>You have severe allergies</li>
<li>You have epilepsy or are prone to seizures</li>
<li>You have heart disease</li>
<li>You have high blood pressure</li>
<li>You are on a course of treatment with prescribed medication</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules for safe usage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many essential oils are too powerful to be applied directly to the skin undiluted (also known as “neat”), they must be diluted with a neutral carrier oil, such as jojoba oil, to avoid irritation.</li>
<li>Never use essential oils on or around the eyes or mucous membranes.</li>
<li>Several oils, like bergamot and other citrus, can cause allergic sensitivity to the sun and should be used with caution.</li>
<li>Children and the elderly can be extra sensitive to the effects of essential oils.</li>
<li>Essential oils are flammable, so keep them away from open flames.</li>
<li>Never ingest essential oils unless it is under the close supervision and prescription of a clinically-trained medical or aromatherapeutic professional. Some oils can be toxic, and if taken internally may be fatal. If you don’t know the specific chemistry of the oil, do not take it internally.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we’ve laid out some ground rules for essential oils, let’s see what you can do with these little gifts from nature.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="uses">Uses for essential oils</h2>
<p>Of course essential oils smell great, but there’s much more to them than just a pretty scent. There are three main techniques to make use of essential oils: aromatic, topical and internal.</p>
<h3>Aromatic</h3>

<p><strong>Diffusion:</strong> This is the healthiest, safest and most effective method of use. The fragrances from essential oils that are detected through your sense of smell actually have profound effects on your body, mood and behavior. When the oils are diffused into the air the healing properties of the essences enter your body through your nose while you appreciate the pleasant smell. The best way to achieve these benefits is by using an essential oil diffuser. We <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-essential-oil-diffuser/" rel="noopener">reviewed these diffusers in-depth</a> and found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPV473S/?tag=ybdoils-20" rel="nofollow">Smiley Daisy</a> to be the best.</p>
<p>As the vaporized microscopic particles come into contact with the soft and moist tissue inside your nose and sinuses their beneficial properties enter directly into your bloodstream and get dispersed throughout your body. At the same time they travel up the olfactory nerve (the one that operates your sense of smell) to the limbic region of your brain where you process feelings and emotions. This is also an important area of the brain involved in memory. Smell and memory are processed through the same part of the brain; that’s why when you smell cookies baking in the oven you may have flashbacks of childhood.</p>

<p>As you smell the beautiful aromas this triggers your brain and the cells of your body, affecting your mood to uplift or calm you, affecting your behavior to slow you down or excite you, affecting your thinking to help you clear your mind and think sharper while remembering important things.</p>
<p>And since the essential oil particles are entering your bloodstream, you are also getting the physical benefits they may offer like muscle relaxation, pain relief, improved digestion and more.</p>
<p>Another added benefit of diffusion is its ability to clean the air. When the air in a space is stagnant, smelly and unclean — like in the winter when your home is closed up — there can be infectious airborne bacteria, viruses and spores floating about ready to make you sick. But when the right essential oil is diffused, in the correct amount, you can actually kill those little buggers in the air before they get to you.</p>
<p>In a quote from aromatherapy expert, David Crow, he writes, “[T]he antimicrobial effects of essential oils are most potent not when the oil is used in liquid form… but when pathogens are exposed to the vapors of the oils.” Not only do the oils clean the air and get into your nose, but they are also penetrating your skin, getting into your bloodstream, protecting and healing you.</p>
<p>Don’t overdo it though. Remember, these oils are extremely concentrated. Prolonged exposure to essential oils can cause ill effects like headaches, nausea or other unpleasant symptoms. Vary your use with different oils of different chemical compounds so that they don’t build up in your system. And avoid letting your diffuser run all day, every day; there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Inhalation:</strong> With oils that are safe to use on the skin (know before you try), you can also take a single drop into one of your hands and rub your hands together to warm them up and spread the oil. Then cup your hands around your nose and take in a deep breath. Doing this, you can achieve the same mood and emotional benefits as with diffusion. A little goes a long way.</p>
<p>It’s good to note that most essential oils can lose their healthy powers when heated, so it’s best to avoid heat-based diffusions like candles and incense burners; stick with a good diffuser.</p>
<h3>Topical</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5375" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage.jpg" alt="eye dropper using essential oil on hand" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/topical-usage-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>For cautionary reasons, it is safest to assume that all essential oils should not be applied to the skin undiluted. Some are safe to use ‘neat’ right out of the bottle, while others can cause you great pain or irritation. Again, know all about your oil before you use it!</p>
<p>A typical dilution is around 2%, which means adding about 12 drops of essential oil to every one ounce of carrier oil. A carrier oil is a neutral nut or vegetable oil you use for dilution. Jojoba and Argan oils are the most common and beneficial, but almond, grapeseed, olive, coconut, sunflower, avocado or kukui oils will work just fine.</p>
<p><strong>Massage:</strong> Place several drops of your diluted oil mixture into your hand and rub them together. Then spread that oil onto your skin — or your partner’s skin — with long strokes. The warmth and friction of your hands will dispense the oil directly into the skin, muscles and bloodstream. Using the right essential oils can relax tension, relieve sore muscles and even improve your skin. Plus it just feels so darn good to get a massage.</p>
<p><strong>Compress:</strong> For localized issues like aches or bruises, place about ten drops of essential oil into a bowl of hot water. Soak a clean cloth in this water solution, then place the cloth on the troubled area for about 10-20 minutes. Repeat if necessary. As before, make sure you know if the oil you use is safe.</p>

<p><strong>Bath:</strong> Avoid dripping your essential oil directly into the bath water; you always want to mix it first with a natural emulsifier like honey, milk, a carrier oil, or even sea salt. Doing this will help emulsify and disperse the essential oils into the water. If you don’t do this, the oils will simply sit on the surface of the water and come into direct contact with your skin, possibly causing burns and dermal toxicity.</p>
<p>Try 5-10 drops of essential oil into ½-1 cup of emulsifier or salt, then stir that mixture into your warm bath water. Soak and relax for as long or as short as you wish as the oils penetrate your skin and stimulate your senses. Be aware that the overuse of essential oils in the bath can cause irritation, so choose only the mild and soothing extracts, and be smart.</p>
<h3>Internal / Ingestion</h3>
<p>Ingesting essential oils for health benefits has been prescribed for centuries by experienced professionals. This process, when administered safely and correctly under supervision, can have profound healing effects on your body with issues like digestion, immune defense and hormonal imbalances. However, ingesting the wrong oils — or even the right oils in the wrong portions — can have disastrous and permanent effects on your internal tissues and overall health, and worst of all, you may not even realize any damage has been done until decades later in your life.</p>
<p>In short: <strong>DO NOT TAKE ESSENTIAL OILS INTERNALLY unless they have been prescribed to you individually by a qualified and clinically-trained medical professional or Clinical Registered Aromatherapist.</strong> When working with essential oils you are ultimately playing with chemistry; if you do not know the specific chemistry of the specific oils, and what that specific collection of chemical constituents in that oil can do to your body, then avoid internal administration and stick with the aromatic processes.</p>
<p>The practice of taking essential oils internally, by mouth, has been a heated debate within the essential oil community. Since the recent rise of the multi-level-marketing essential oil companies, and other brands claiming that their oils are pure enough to eat, the idea of freely ingesting essential oils has plagued the minds of the average consumer.</p>
<p>In our research, we came across a number of ill-informed consumers who readily believe that any essential oil, from any company, is safe to consume. Sadly, the exact opposite is true: ANY essential oil can be harmful if ingested improperly and without professional supervision.</p>
<p>Clinically trained professionals have spent years learning the delicate and complicated chemistry of essential oils and how they relate to the sensitive tissues of the human body, inside and out. Please, seek the guidance of a knowledgeable professional before putting any essential oil into your mouth.</p>
<p>We’ve learned how to safely use essential oils, now it’s time to go shopping.</p>

<p>When we set out to find the best essential oils available in America we thought it would be a straightforward matter of finding the companies with the best ratings and reviews, buying some oils and testing them for smell and feel. We never expected to find it such a difficult task.</p>
<p>In the world of essential oils there is an enormous amount of controversy and competition, with some companies accusing other companies of being less pure, while others claim trademarks and exclusivity on their products. All of this noise creates plenty of confusion for the average consumer to sift through, especially since there is no official regulation or oversight on the essential oil industry, federal or otherwise.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, the FDA generally classifies essential oils as cosmetics, but they can also <em>sometimes</em> be considered drugs. In a quote direct from <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Products/ucm127054.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the US Food and Drug Administration website</a>, “The law doesn’t require cosmetics to have FDA approval before they go on the market.” In addition, if a product claims to affect the health and function of the body, such as relieving anxiety, aiding digestion or calming sore muscles, the product must be approved by the FDA as a drug, which is a very long and costly process.</p>
<p>Most private and holistic essential oil companies simply can’t afford to go through that process, so they instead opt to comply with the FDA’s much more lax regulations regarding cosmetics; no approval required. So this leaves the real regulation up to you, the consumer.</p>
<p>To help us get a more clear understanding of what to look for in essential oils we spoke with Clinical Registered Aromatherapist, Anna Doxie. She is the founder of the <a href="http://authenticaromatherapyeducation.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute of Holistic Phyto-Aromatherapy</a> and Director Coordinator and Director of the Southern California Region of the <a href="https://naha.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy</a> (NAHA) and an esteemed Aromatherapy instructor. We’ve also combed through NAHA’s educational materials, consulted the prolific writings of Dr. Robert Pappas — a highly respected name in essential oil testing and education — and sought many other independent sources of information to present to you some guidelines for finding the best essential oil:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultivation of the plants</li>
<li>Distillation and Extraction</li>
<li>Testing and Purity</li>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Labeling and Information</li>
<li>Price</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cultivation and farming</h3>
<p><strong>The most important terms to look for regarding the way the plants are grown and harvested are Certified Organic, Wild Harvested, or unofficially organic</strong> <strong>(sometimes called “unsprayed”).</strong> A reputable essential oil company will freely disclose all information about where and how their source plants are grown, and they’ll be proud of their organic choices.</p>
<p>More importantly, the founders and owners of the companies will have personal relationships with the farmers so they can be certain of what they are getting. There are many tiny, locally operated farms around the world who can’t afford the extremely high costs of organic certification, yet they still practice organic farming which includes: no use of chemical pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers, no genetically modified seeds, and healthy crop rotation to protect the soils. That is what is meant by Unsprayed.</p>
<p>Wild harvested is just that, the plants are cut from their natural, indigenous location; no farming, totally wild.</p>
<p>Another important factor to know about the oil is the geographical location each plant was grown. Plants grow naturally and thrive in climates and conditions suitable for their health. Plants farmed in locations outside of their natural habitats will be less effective when distilled. The climate, the soil, the time of year (and sometimes even the time of day) have great effects on the quality of the essential oils and good companies know this.</p>
<h3>Distillation and extraction</h3>
<p>Distilleries can be certified organic also, but as with the small farms, small distilleries can’t afford the certification, yet they practice organic methods.</p>
<p>It is important to know exactly how the oils were extracted. As we discussed earlier with how essential oils are produced, specific methods are required for specific plants. A good essential oil company will declare the method used for each individual oil. If you don’t see any method of extraction, or you find a blanket statement saying that all their oils are steam distilled, be wary, they could be fake.</p>
<h3>Purity</h3>

<p>This is the biggest and most hotly argued aspect of the unregulated essential oil market. Be aware, there are no official legal bindings to the terms, “Pure”, “100% Pure”, “Natural”, and “Therapeutic Grade”; in fact there are no grades at all regarding essential oils. If you see any of these, or similar terms on essential oils, they are completely meaningless marketing slogans.</p>
<p>For effective therapeutic uses, it is imperative that only the purest of essential oils are used. What we mean by ‘pure’ is that the only thing inside that tiny bottle is the essential oil from the specific plant on the label, no additives, no other chemicals, no synthetic fragrances or diluents, and no other kind of oil — natural or otherwise.</p>
<p>To cut costs many low-quality companies will fill their bottles with mostly vegetable oil or water and only add a small percentage of real essential oil. Others will put in cheaper essential oils that smell similar to the real plant and label it as the real thing. An example is using litsea oil in place of lemongrass. This is called adulteration.</p>
<p>The worst deception is when poor companies use synthetic fragrances mixed into vegetable oil and pass it off as true essential oil. This is where the real danger to your health can come: the National Academy of Sciences reported that the 95 percent of synthetic fragrances come from petroleum and have the potential to cause cancer, birth defects, central nervous system disorders and allergic reactions.</p>
<p>So how do you know if the oils are real?</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>In order to know if an essential oil is pure and true it must be tested in a chemistry lab. The Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) test is a standard in the industry. This test separates and analyzes the chemical compounds while confirming the elemental composition within a sample, helping chemists to determine whether or not the essential oil has been tainted. Good companies will have third-party GC/MS reports for every batch of oil available for you to read.</p>

<p><a href="https://essentialoils.org/news/eo_myths" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Robert Pappas says</a>, &#8220;There are a lot of companies out there selling essential oils and most of them have no ability (or in many cases no desire) to do the necessary quality control to verify what they are getting from their supplier before they pass it on to their customers.” The GC/MS test determines the quality and can show evidence of adulteration, although it is not perfect. Good companies will employ other tests as well like, Organoleptic (sensory tests), or FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy).</p>
<p>There are many companies out there, even popular, big name essential oil companies, whose oils have been independently tested by consumers with GC/MS and other processes, and have been found to include synthetic and other ingredients within their apparently “pure” essential oils. That is why it is so important to have batch-specific tests for every oil, and to buy from a company you really know and trust.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5379" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet.jpg" alt="storing bottles in a cool cabinet" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cool-storage-cabinet-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, essential oils are volatile which means they can degrade quickly under poor conditions, especially with exposure to light, heat or oxygen. To protect the integrity of the oils it is best to keep them in dark glass containers in a cool location in your home — refrigeration is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Every essential oil has a unique shelf life and the good companies will tell you how many years the oil will keep its potency. It’s a good practice to write the date on the bottle when you first open it so you know exactly how old it is years later.</p>
<p>There are few companies who take storage to the highest regard by keeping their oils refrigerated in bottles with nitrogen pumped in to prevent exposure to oxygen. You don’t need to go that far at home, but just don’t leave them in the sun.</p>
<h3>Labeling</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5380" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats.jpg" alt="product details on a label" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bottle-label-stats-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Very simply, you want to read on the label — or information page for every oil — the true Latin name of the plant from which the oil was extracted, as well as the country from which the plant was harvested. Some companies will go further and tell you the method of extraction, the farming quality and also the chemical family of the oil. Plus seeing the batch number on the bottle helps you match it with its testing.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>The old adage, “you get what you pay for” is generally quite true when it comes to essential oils. Producing and distributing high-quality essential oils is a time consuming and expensive process. If you find an essential oil at a price significantly lower than most major brands, you’re not getting a good deal, you’re probably getting a fake product.</p>
<p>The most expensive oils will usually offer you the highest purity, quality and integrity. What you’re paying for is the care and great attention to quality. The last thing you want to save a couple of bucks on is your own health or the health of your family.</p>
<p>Knowing the average cost of a good quality oil needs to be taken into consideration when purchasing from large companies with large marketing agendas. Marketing costs a lot of money, as do quality essential oils, so be certain that every dollar of your hard-earned money is going fully into the quality of the essential oil rather than its promotion, advertising and salespeople.</p>

<h3>Scent</h3>
<p>Very simply, the essential oil must smell like it’s supposed to, and that’s where knowing the aromas comes in handy. If your bottle of eucalyptus smells more like mint, then you probably don’t have eucalyptus in your hands.</p>
<p>Of course, you won’t know this until you actually buy and open the oil yourself, so we took care of that for you.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Since we are not chemists, nor do we have the resources or equipment to evaluate the chemical purity of the essential oils, we stuck with methods of evaluation available to the average consumer. Out of the nearly 40 different essential oil companies researched we were able to narrow down the list to a total of seven reputable companies by using the parameters listed above in our section ‘<a href="#what-to-look-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What to look for when purchasing essential oils</a>.’</p>
<p>Then we purchased bottles of Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), and Lemon (Citrus limon) from each of the seven companies we selected to perform our in-house testing. We gathered a group of four people from our office and administered a formal blind smell test to evaluate which oils smelled the best and which smelled the worst out of the selections.</p>
<p>Disguising the names of the companies we placed two drops of each oil on a strip of white card paper marked with a single letter for reference. We had each test participant smell a strip of lavender, one at a time, from each company rating it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freshness</li>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Familiarity</li>
<li>Purity (smelling something in the background besides the lavender)</li>
<li>Richness (fully rounded smell, or incomplete and empty)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, once each brand of lavender was evaluated individually we asked them to compare all of the different lavender scents to judge their personal preference and to rate which ones gave the highest sense of quality.</p>
<p>We then did the whole thing over again with the lemon essential oils. Here are the cumulative rankings from the testing:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5372" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings.png" alt="blind scent ranking data chart" width="901" height="645" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings.png 901w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-610x437.png 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-768x550.png 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-300x215.png 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-295x211.png 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-885x634.png 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-360x258.png 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-375x268.png 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-414x296.png 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blind-scent-rankings-320x229.png 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Finally, we performed a common and simple test for purity. Since essential oils are not truly oils they respond differently when they come into contact with blotting paper. When pure essential oils are dropped onto a piece of blotting paper they will impregnate the paper and then evaporate leaving no obvious trace. However, if you place a drop of diluted essential oil on blotting paper, the vegetable oil used to stretch the original will leave an oily stain on the paper.</p>
<p>We placed a single drop from each bottle onto individual pieces of blotting paper and watched with fascination as the spots disappeared with every sample. No dilutions. No carrier oils. All pure. We expected that, but it’s nice to see it in person.</p>

<p>Based in Sedona, Arizona, Stillpoint Aromatics was the passionate creation of Joy Musacchio and Cynthia Brownley, two highly educated women who have been working with essential oils since 1990. In seeking the world’s best sources these very resourceful women have cultivated first-name-basis, personal relationships with farmers and distillers around the planet.</p>

They have excellent oil scents, along with the highest standards for farming, production and storage practices.</p><a href="http://www.stillpointaromatics.com/essential-oils" target="_blank"><button>See Price at StillpointAromatics.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In 2010 they started Stillpoint to offer over 200 of “the purest therapeutic quality essential oils that we have ever experienced.” Additionally, they offer true Aromatherapy Certification programs that are accredited with both the National Association of Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA) and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists (AIA).</p>
<p>Here’s what makes their essential oils so great:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultivation and distillation: All of their oils are either Certified Organic, Wild Harvested, or Unsprayed (organically grown without certification)</li>
<li>Testing and purity: Every single batch of every single oil they sell is GC/MS tested by an independent laboratory in France. Then the chemical family of the oils is printed directly on the bottle’s label to assist experienced Aromatherapists.</li>
<li>Storage: Once they receive their shipments directly from the distiller (no middlemen) they immediately pour them into amber-colored bottles, then they remove the oxygen by filling the remaining space in the bottles with nitrogen before placing them in cold storage; this drastically reduces oxidation and greatly enhances the shelf-life and vibrancy of the oils. And if that weren’t special enough, Joy and Cynthia literally hand-pour every bottle to order. What this means is, the essential oil stays in cold storage, with nitrogen, until you place your order, only then will the oil be poured custom into the tiny 15mL amber bottle, just for you! No one else takes such pride and care.</li>
<li>Labeling and information: Each hand-poured bottle displays:<br />
-the Latin name<br />
-the source country<br />
-the quality of farming (organic, etc.)<br />
-the part of the plant this oil came from<br />
-how it was extracted<br />
-the chemical family of this oil<br />
-the batch number, so you can see the GC/MS test for that specific oil</li>
<li>Price: Yes, these oils are pricy. At $23.00 for a tiny 5mL bottle of wild lavender, it’s the second most expensive oil, with Oshadhi coming in first at $36.30 for 10mL. But the price is well worth it for the enormous quality you are getting with these oils.</li>
<li>Love: Every order shipped comes with a custom, handwritten note from Joy and Cynthia thanking you for choosing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our scent tests the Stillpoint’s oils started off smelling mild and fresh, but then after a minute or two they magically blossomed and became very rich, deep, vibrant, stronger and more clear; almost like a fine wine opens up after being uncorked for some time. And for those who may be sensitive to subtle energies, these oils possessed a very clean and high vibration, which is an enormous benefit when using the oils for spiritual practice. No other oils we tested performed this way.</p>
<p>Our testers rated Stillpoint tops in all tests. With their impeccable standards for quality and preservation, there is no question that Stillpoint Aromatics has the best essential oils.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.floracopeia.com/Essential-Oils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floracopeia</a> is another small, independently-owned company with very ethical roots. Started in 2004 in Grass Valley, CA by David and Sara Crow, Floracopeia is our second-best essential oil company. Like Stillpoint, they have strong personal relationships with their distillers; they will even get their hands dirty as they help harvest the plants for extraction when they visit.</p>
<p>Floracopeia’s goal is not only to offer great essential oils but also to help create sustainable ecological, environmental and economic situations that support the small, rural farmers and distillers, as well as the planet. Their Eco-Projects, like the wild agarwood trees in Thailand, reduce illegal harvesting and help create a sustainable forestry system while supporting the livelihoods of the local villagers. And just like Stillpoint, David and Sara offer training and certifications in Aromatherapy.</p>

<p>All of their essential oils are either organic or wild harvested, and while they do not do their own testing, they rely on trusted and vetted relationships with their distillers who provide them with GC/MS tests.</p>
<p>The labels on the Floracopeia bottles offer all the important information you need from a trustworthy brand, including Latin names, organic quality, country of origin and batch number. Not as information-rich as Stillpoint’s bottles, but they still give you all the significant facts for quality oil.</p>
<p>Floracopeia’s very delicate and pure scent comes at almost half the cost of Stillpoint Aromatics’ oils. Priced at $25.00 for a 15mL bottle of organic lavender, that’s about $1.67 per mL, compared to Stillpoint’s $3.17 per mL for wild lavender.</p>
<p>Although Floracopeia doesn’t provide the extensive storage and preservation practices like Stillpoint, their pure and authentic essential oils, with ethical and sustainable practices, as well as a good price, make them an easy pick for our runner up.</p>

<h3>From Nature With Love</h3>

<p>Our third choice was a company called <a href="https://www.fromnaturewithlove.com/soap/EssentialOils.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From Nature With Love</a> in Oxford, CT. In our scent tests they actually scored in second place overall however there were a few other issues that dropped them below Floracopeia.</p>
<p>First, their bottles didn’t come with the little plastic dripper caps that cover the mouth of the bottle (aka. orifice reducer), they just had a simple screw cap. Without the orifice reducers, you either have to pour the oil out and make a mess or dip an eye dropper into the oil which can potentially contaminate the product if you’re not careful. Plus if oil gets into the little rubber bulb of the eyedropper it can get stuck in there and go bad, further contaminating the oil.</p>
<p>Second, From Nature With Love is a wholesaler which means they offer products like cosmetics bases and other ingredients for making your own lotions, creams, soaps and more. So their primary focus is not top quality essential oils, but instead, being a one-stop shop for natural body care cosmetics makers.</p>
<p>Third, even though they are a member of NAHA, only some of their essential oils are organic — the lemon was not — and they do not perform GC/MS testing. However, they do fill the amber bottles with nitrogen just like Stillpoint, but that’s the extent of their preservation.</p>
<p>From Nature With Love has some very nice oils, and if you’re planning on making your own lotions they’re a good buy. But for everyday uses, we’d recommend sticking with Stillpoint Aromatics or Floracopeia.</p>
<h3>Mountain Rose Herbs</h3>

<p>Based in Eugene, OR, <a href="https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/catalog/aromatherapy/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mountain Rose Herbs</a> offers USDA Organic essential oils, in addition to a variety of other products like teas, spices, bath and body items, and kitchen tools. They are a very eco-conscious and sustainable company, but in the scent tests we tried, they seemed to lack the aromatic quality of the top choices.</p>
<p>The prices were about average at $12.75 for 15mL of lavender, but with so many alternate products they offer, their full attention to quality in the essential oils becomes spread a little thin.</p>
<h3>Plant Therapy</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5384 size-full" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles.jpg" alt="plant therapy bottles" width="900" height="596" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles.jpg 900w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-610x404.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-768x509.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-300x199.jpg 300w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-295x195.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-885x586.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-360x238.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-375x248.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-414x274.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/plant-therapy-bottles-320x212.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.planttherapy.com/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plant Therapy</a> essential oils is a family owned company in Twin Falls, ID, and they’ve teamed up with world-renowned Aromatherapy expert, Robert Tisserand to help them ensure their oil’s quality and purity. They offer both USDA Organic and conventionally farmed essential oils in all the popular scents, and they test each batch with GC/MS.</p>
<p>With all those glowing statistics it came as a surprise that our testers gave very mixed reviews with these oils. Some thought they were strong and clear, while others noticed strange undertones and even artificial, candy-like qualities. Because of this, they ranked number five overall in our smell test.</p>
<p>Plant Therapy’s labels are a bit scarce in their information. They display the proper Latin names and the USDA Organic logo, but that’s it. Instead of including the country of origin and other important notes — which can be found on the website — they have a long description of what the oils could be used for and how to use it, followed by an FDA disclaimer so they won’t get in trouble.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.oshadhiusa.com/essential-oil-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oshadhi</a> is a German company imported to America and it was the most expensive oil at $36.30 for 10mL of lavender; that’s more than Stillpoint. But even with that high price these oils got some pretty low ratings with our test group. They noticed sourness in the lavender, hints of chemical flavor in the lemon and weakness in all the scents.</p>
<p>They do sell only organic and wild harvested oils and have been in the essential oil business since 1990. Their labels have everything you need to know, including the chemical family of the oils and very clear batch numbers, but that just wasn’t enough to convince us to like the the way they smelled.</p>

<p>This brand got the worst test scores of all. <a href="https://www.rockymountainoils.com/shoprmo/essential-oils/shop-singles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocky Mountain Oils</a> from Orem, UT smelled weak and medicinal; someone even said it smelled like a laundry detergent. This was our only brand that did not offer organic oils of any kind, and perhaps that lower quality of farming was what gave them such strange aromas.</p>
<p>RMO, as they brand themselves, tests every batch with GC/MS analysis which you can easily view on their website, but their labels are inconsistent. All of them show the Latin name, but only some offer you the country from which the plants were sourced, but like the other companies, all useful information can be found on the website.</p>
<h3>Other companies</h3>
<p>The popular multi-level marketing companies, dōTERRA and Young Living didn’t make our top picks for several important reasons: their high retail prices, their lack of organic certification for all of their oils, and their insistence that most of their essential oils are safe to take internally not giving any regard to the potential health hazards of self-prescribing without professional clinical supervision.</p>
<p>We want you to be safe and we don’t want abundant marketing to convince you that you can be your own chemist without the necessary training. For all of these reasons, we have chosen not to include these companies in our testing.</p>
<h2 class="collapse" id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Every one of the oils we tested offered their own unique signatures of aroma, and with this very subjective task we have undertaken, it made finding the best essential oils an extremely difficult project. Our criteria was strict and our noses were ready for the challenge. When it comes to your health we didn’t want to let money be a deterrent for finding you the truly best.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stillpointaromatics.com/essential-oils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stillpoint Aromatics</a>, with their vibrant, rich scents, plus their devotion to the utmost of quality in sourcing, storage and preservation made them stand out high above the crowd. You can sense the life and the energy in these oils, and no other brand can compare to that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.floracopeia.com/Essential-Oils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Floracopeia</a> has a passionate dedication for the health of the planet and the farmers who work upon it, while providing pure and authentic essential oils. Their freshness and integrity is present in every bottle of oil they offer, and at nearly half the price of our top pick they earn a deserving and proud second place.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own preferences in scents, brands and quality, so your personal opinions on what you like best may differ from ours. With a respectful, neutral perspective and a fresh experience on essential oils we are confident that you will get the most exceptional products from these companies.</p>
