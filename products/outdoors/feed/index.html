				<description><![CDATA[Our team of testers carried six bags for 12,000 steps and tested five factors before choosing the Boost as the best gym bag with a shoe compartment.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur team of testers took 12,000 steps and 12 trips to the gym in pursuit of the best gym bag with a shoe compartment. After a week of side-by-side testing, we determined that the best overall is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boost &#8211; Sports Gym Bag</a>. It’s inexpensive yet sturdy, water-resistant and provides the most enjoyable day-long carrying experience. Close behind was the roomy, durable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011R5MHKC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas &#8211; Team Issue</a>, best for athletes and outdoor exercisers.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>The market for gym bags is filled with great products in wildly varied size and price ranges. To narrow our testing field, we set our budget at 50 dollars and only looked for bags with excellent average review ratings at the usual online retailers.</p>
<p>From there, we checked lists from Men’s Health, Wirecutter and NY Magazine. When we found a bag that was on multiple lists and met both our buyer-rating and budget criteria, we added it to a shortlist for testing.</p>
<p>Finally, we talked to our gym-going colleagues and friends to find out which bags they use and love. Our final list is made up of high-quality, inexpensive, well-loved bags that have the features to make your trips to the gym more productive and maybe even less smelly.</p>
<h2 id="lineup">Compare the best gym bags</h2>
[table id=328 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>We chose gym bags specifically with shoe compartments to test, and that distinction naturally lent itself to at least medium-sized bags. Our goal was to find a bag comfortable enough to carry, but big enough to fit not only our shoes and gym outfits, but also toiletries and cosmetics, a change of clothes, a full water bottle and one specialty equipment item (we chose boxing gloves). If walking to the gym, you may want a smaller bag like the gym-friendly pick in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-laptop-backpack/#17-inch-pick">Laptop Backpack review</a>. If transporting large equipment, you&#8217;ll want to check out larger bags.</p>
<h3>Weight</h3>
<p>Depending on the weight of the equipment you’re carrying and the distance you have to travel with your gym bag, you’ll likely want as lightweight a bag as possible. If you’re opting for a heavier bag for either style or sturdiness, you’ll want to make sure the bag’s straps are adequately padded. All the gym bags we tested are two pounds or fewer, with the exception of the Everest.</p>
<h3>Material</h3>
<p>We looked for a bag that we were confident could last and remain fresh for a long time. We considered material type (body of the bag and zippers included), which influences how much weight a bag can bear, how susceptible it is to tearing and its breathability.</p>
<p>Generally, gym bags with shoe compartments are made of nylon (often laminated and less breathable), polyester (more breathable), or some combination of the two. The strongest bags in our bunch were blends. In the case of our top pick, different weaves are added to the mix, but a backing is still present to keep out water.</p>
<p>You should also note that breathable fabric also allows water in. Nylon technically gets soggy more than polyester if you let it sit in the rain, but it&#8217;s the rubbery backing that keeps your clothes dry inside.</p>
<p>To mitigate the effect a waterproof bag might have on the smells trapped inside, find a bag that includes a vented shoe compartment.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>Most gym bags with a shoe compartment will do a fairly decent job of holding everything you need. What sets the great apart from the good is a bag’s ability to organize. The amount, size and arrangement of pockets can make a huge difference in how functional a gym bag is. When working out under a time constraint, digging for the items you need can be incredibly frustrating. Check for pocket numbers and layouts that will make your life easier, not harder.</p>
[table id=330 /]
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Over the course of a week, we tested six different bags  on our commutes and in our gyms. We standardized our packing lists to include sneakers, clothes for working out, a change of street clothes, cosmetics, a water bottle, electronics, keys and a pair of boxing gloves.</p>
<h3>Packing and functionality</h3>
<p>Our picks ranged from four pockets to nine (with the shoe compartment included), with the Mier &#8211; 20 inches Sports Gym bag at the lowest end and the Everest &#8211; Gym Bag with Wet Pocket at the highest. The latter became our organizational favorite, but still wasn’t our top pick overall.</p>
<p>As we packed for each of our trips to the gym, we used our standardized packing list to establish a preference for one gym bag over another. We wanted to know which bag was the best organizational help and which felt like a bottomless pit. Packing and using the same gear for our trips gave us a clear indicator which bags we liked to use best.</p>
[table id=329 /]
<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>Each gym bag accompanied our team members on their individual commutes, but each bag was also taken for a roughly 2,000 step journey to compare comfort levels. We rated the comfort level of each bag on a star system, where one is “ too uncomfortable to use again,” two is “became very uncomfortable quickly”, three is “pretty comfortable”  and four is “no discomfort at all.”</p>
<p>Because different testers can comfortably carry different weights, potentially influencing this test, we also made a more direct assessment of strap padding.</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25398" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key.jpg" alt="Testing abrasion resistance with a key" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Key-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We left each bag hanging with 30 pounds inside for one hour to test the strength of straps, buckles and zippers. Next, we applied a scratch test. For the scratch test, we took a key and scraped the outside and the lining of each bag with varying degrees of pressure (first soft, then firm, then as hard as possible) and recorded any tears or permanent scratches.</p>
<h3>Breathability and smell</h3>
<p>To test how well our bags dealt with moisture and smell, we performed two tests. For the first test, we kept our dirty gym clothes in the bag for a full eight hours, and after taking the clothes out, noted how long the bag retained its dirty smell. We unzipped each bag but did not fully open them, and checked in at the half hour, hour and two hour mark.</p>
<p>For the second, we muddied an old pair of sneakers and put them into the designated shoe compartment. Then, we checked back in an hour to see if the mud was dry. We also checked to see if we could smell the shoes from the outside of the bag from both a foot away and right next to the bag.</p>
<p>Our goal was to find a gym bag that resisted odors entirely, but it became clear that this was unrealistic, so we placed greater emphasis on the second test and the breathability of a bag’s shoe compartment.</p>
<h3>Water resistance</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25397" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water.jpg" alt="Testing waterproofing" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gym-Bags-Testing-Water-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>We also poured a cup of water directly onto our bags to test claims of water resistance or waterproof-ness. For bags claiming to be only water resistant, we accepted damp clothes as a result, but not wet ones. Waterproof bags needed to keep clothes inside completely dry.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>If you’re carrying specialized equipment that sees a lot of outdoor use, you’ll want a gym bag with a shoe compartment that cleans easily. As a final test, we gave each of our gym bags a thorough cleaning with wipes to compare maintenance effort.</p>
<p>We counted how many wipes it took to clean each bag, checked to see if mud remained in nooks and crannies after a single cleaning pass and gave extra kudos for machine washable bags.</p>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Boost</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25402" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Boost.jpg" alt="Boost" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Our tests to find the best gym bag with shoe compartment confirmed our initial intuition; many of these bags are excellent, and this was a tough race. Ultimately, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boost</a> proved itself as our favorite with its attention to detail, overall functionality and affordable price.</p>
<p>The Boost gym bag was near the top of our list for functionality thanks to its structure and layout; it has five total pockets (including the shoe compartment), and one is meant specifically for holding wet clothes or swimsuits. It has no designated place for toiletries, but our team was satisfied storing those in the front pocket. On the side is a mesh bottle pocket we found perfect for holding the full range of sizes we&#8217;ve tested in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">water bottle review</a>, and the shoe compartment was vented, which helped it perform well in our breathability and smell test.</p>
<p>In terms of comfort, we loved the Boost gym bag for its comfortable straps, and for the way its shape helps it stay easy to carry on long trips. The unique (among this group of bags) textured material – a nylon-blend oxford weave – made the bag feel more luxurious.</p>

Its thoughtful design makes the Boost a great, functional companion for the gym</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Performing well on our durability test was an absolute must, and the Boost gym bag did not disappoint. We thought its unique fabric texture might rip easily, but no amount of pressure in our scratch test damaged the bag. In the weighted hanging test, we found that the reinforced seams and metal clasps held the load without trouble. The added reinforcement on the bottom of the bag and its water-resistant (though not waterproof) outside ensure this bag will last a long time.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Boost &#8211; Sports Gym Bag excels in combining versatile functionality with subtle style.</li>
<li>If you need a fully waterproof gym bag, you’ll need to look elsewhere (like the runner-up from Adidas), but this bag can handle a bit of water, and can keep wet clothes separate.</li>
<li>The relatively low price and high durability of this gym bag make it ideal for long term use without making a big investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="runner-up">Runner up: Adidas</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25401" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Adidas.jpg" alt="Adidas" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011R5MHKC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas &#8211; Team Issue</a> came highly recommended not only by a number of review websites, but also by some trusted friends and colleagues who swore by its longevity and spaciousness. Our team found that it lived up to its reputation, but fell slightly short in terms of functionality.</p>
<p>The main pro of the Adidas bag is that it combines lightweight comfort with durability. We knew from other tests that this bag would be durable, but from the way the fabric blend (nylon, polyester and elastane) felt in our hands, and considering the bag weighs less than two pounds, we were surprised by how well it stood up to abuse.</p>
<p>In our durability tests, this bag performed extremely well. The straps barely strained holding 30 pounds for an hour, and no amount of scratching (on any of the distinct fabric types) left a lasting mark. It comes with a lifetime guarantee, but we don’t think you’ll need to use it.</p>
<p>It’s the elastane in the fabric mix that gives this bag its stretch and lightweight feel, and the nylon provides a fair degree of water resistance, especially on the reinforced bottom. We found too that the lining of this bag was great at repelling moisture — lugging around wet clothes or swimsuits won’t be an issue, nor would setting this bag down in a puddle on the locker room floor.</p>

<p>Our Adidas gym bag was slightly quicker to clean than our top pick and also included a vented shoe compartment, which we liked for our muddy shoes and sweaty clothes. Even with five total pockets, though, its spartan functionality (or lack thereof) knocked it to number two on our list.</p>
<p>Despite a small toiletries section, the main pocket felt way too disorganized. With almost no structure (and no water bottle pocket), we found that our items continued to slide around in transit, knocking our attempts at organization further out of alignment.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Adidas &#8211; Team Issue is a great bag for athletes because of its easy cleanability and cavernous design.</li>
<li>For a busy, everyday gym-goer, this bag’s lack of structured organization made finding things too difficult.</li>
<li>The mix of durability and light weight this bag provides makes it a comfortable way to lug your gym gear that will last a long time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-other-finalists">The other finalists we tested</h2>
<h3>Coreal</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25403" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Coreal.jpg" alt="Coreal" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CTPM7MC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coreal &#8211; Sport Gym Bag</a> is another gym bag that makes great use of its pockets. High functionality combined with a fully waterproof shell almost earned it a top spot.</p>
<p>We found this bag to be spacious yet organized and especially liked the side pockets. A dedicated water bottle pocket seems like it should be a prerequisite for a good gym bag, but not all of our picks had one, so we appreciated Coreal for including theirs. This bag passed our packing functionality test easily.</p>
<p>The most fully waterproof of all our finalists, we felt so confident in this bag’s impenetrability that one of our testers took it into a torrential downpour. It protected the contents inside and proved its worth even further.</p>
<p>A completely waterproof shell does come with one main drawback, however, and that is the Coreal gym bag’s complete lack of breathability. The bag is mainly waterproofed ripstop nylon, and the shoe compartment has no vent. During our testing, we noticed that our muddy shoes were not dry after an hour and that the Coreal bag retained the smell of our sweaty gym clothes overnight.</p>
<p>If you live in an especially wet climate, or favor swimming as your exercise of choice, this orderly, highly waterproof bag is perfect. If, on the other hand, you aren’t keen on at least wiping down your gym bag after every use, more breathable designs on this list may serve you better.</p>
<h3>Everest</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25394" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Everest.jpg" alt="Everest" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F3FVTC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Everest</a> was the top of Wirecutter’s list of best gym bags for a while before they reconsidered due to durability issues. Likewise, a number of other sites and friends suggested giving this bag a try, and it performed well until our durability test, where it ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Nine pockets (including shoe compartment) make it very easy to put everything in exactly the right place when using this bag; there is even an extra water bottle pocket, which would be great for bringing coffee or tea during a commute to an early morning workout. The inside compartment of the Everest gym bag is smartly divided and we especially liked that it included both a wet-item pocket and a pocket for toiletries and cosmetics. We felt that this bag could have easily held double our packing list and remained high in our functionality ranks; there really is a place for everything.</p>
<p>This bag may not be waterproof and is barely water resistant – our clothes were definitely damp after we did our water test – but it did a great job at not holding onto odors. While the lining of the main compartment was a little more difficult to clean than others, we had no trouble wiping the shoe compartment of its mud thanks to its more water-resistant material.</p>
<p>Where the Everest gym bag lost our testers was in its durability testing; even before applying full pressure, we were able to tear the polyester canvas on the outside of the bag. During the hanging test, we also saw that the seams were straining and were worried they might pop; our top three gym bags with shoe compartments performed much better.</p>
<p>Our testers also found that the sub-par straps on the Everest bag less comfortable to travel on their shoulder than most other bags on this list. Though Everest provides padding for the long strap, we found it to be insufficient. This gym bag will serve you really well for a while, but if you have to walk far with the bag or expect to have it for a long time, you may want to reconsider.</p>
<h3>G4free</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25395" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/G4free.jpg" alt="G4free" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>A few of our testers prefer backpacks over duffels, so were excited to give the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KV96XFU/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">G4Free &#8211; 3-Way 40L</a> convertible backpack a try, thinking it would be more comfortable.</p>
<p>While we found this bag to be high on our functionality list – it’s convertible and has lots of organization features – we were disappointed to find that the padding for the duffel strap was much more substantial than the padding for the backpack straps. This makes carrying the G4free less comfortable as a backpack than it should be.</p>
<p>When performing the weighted hanging test with this bag, we did separate tests for the duffel straps and the backpack straps. The duffel straps performed well, but the backpack straps did not. Though it’s likely the backpack straps were made thinner to make sure they tuck into their pocket during conversion, we thought a bit more reinforcement wouldn’t hurt. Our key also made some faint marks during the scratch test portion of our durability investigation.</p>
<p>Pluses of this bag include its lightweight design and its waterproof shell; like the Coreal gym bag, though, the shoe compartment was not vented and made for wet, muddy and smelly sneakers. We appreciated the addition of a toiletries pocket, but missed the water bottle pocket.</p>
<h3>Mier</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25399" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mier.jpg" alt="Mier" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Our testers might have marked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A4Z4VC8/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mier &#8211; SPO002</a> higher if other products on this list hadn’t been so excellent. As a gym bag with shoe compartment, it’s perfectly adequate, but has nothing to set it apart from the rest.</p>
<p>We were excited by the structure in this bag, a factor which usually makes packing easier, but with only four total pockets, we felt like some of our smaller items had nowhere to go where they wouldn’t get lost. This alone doesn’t make this bag our least favorite, but combined with its poor performance during other tests, it didn’t quite live up to expectations. There is almost no padding on the straps (which struggled as a whole throughout testing) to provide comfort and we quite easily put marks in the nylon material of this bag during our scratch test. Other gym bags jumped ahead quickly in the rankings.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>During our testing, we looked for a gym bag with excellent features that could be had for under 50 dollars, and the competition was quite close.</p>
<p>Our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLQP1T1/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Boost &#8211; Sports Gym Bag</a>, earned its number one spot by passing all of our durability tests and particularly wowing our testers in packing functionality and comfort.</p>
<p>We placed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011R5MHKC/?tag=ybdgymbag-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas &#8211; Team Issue</a> in a very close second place, and it’s a great choice for sports equipment. The high quality of this bag means you may never have to replace it.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Before choosing our rolling duffel bag contenders, we consulted with two flight attendants, Erin Lee and Lam Nguyen, for their tips on buying a high-performing rolling duffel. Erin and Lam have 47 years of combined steward experience between them.</p>
<p>Lam points out that the two downfalls of most rolling duffel bags are poorly designed handles and wheels that don’t roll smoothly. “It can be awkward because duffel bags aren’t made to have wheels, due to their long shape,” she says. “It helps to have large wheels that won’t get stuck in cracks in the ground and a handle design that’s ergonomic and easy to pull up and push down.”</p>
<p>For checked luggage, Erin recommends a duffel made of ballistic materials, which are the most durable.</p>
<p>We also researched buyers’ most highly sought-after features by reading through Amazon reviews and Reddit threads. Based on our findings, we searched for duffels with the following qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-wheeled, rather than four-wheeled (two-wheeled rollers can handle a variety of surfaces better than four-wheeled; spinner wheels also protrude and take up more space in overhead bins)</li>
<li>An exterior made of nylon (preferably ballistic) or polyester with at least an 800 denier count (see our “Fabric” section below)</li>
<li>A D-shaped or clamshell opening, which is generally easier to access than a slit-style opening</li>
<li>A roomy but well-organized interior</li>
<li>A balanced design that stands up on its own without tipping over</li>
<li>Sturdy, wide-set inline skate wheels</li>
<li>At least two exterior handles plus a base grip for easy carrying and lifting</li>
<li>A smooth telescoping handle</li>
<li>High-quality zippers</li>
<li>Price point below $150</li>
</ul>
<p>We tested two categories of rolling duffels: carry on (around 21 inches in length) and full size (about 30 inches).</p>
<p>For our full-size duffel category, the 30-inch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005OQZ5ZA/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FŪL &#8211; Tour Manager Deluxe</a> caught our eyes first. Made of durable 1680D ballistic nylon, the bag features a clamshell design that can also transform into one large compartment. We also selected the 30-inch, 1500D-polyester <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010C61G8G/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Olympia &#8211; Drop Bottom Rolling Duffel</a>, which users praise for its lightweight yet sturdy construction.</p>
<p>Our carry-on contenders are the 20-inch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HO8F8I/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A. Saks &#8211; Expandable Wheeled Duffel</a>, a spacious, expandable design made of 420D nylon, and the 21-inch expandable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D45H5P4/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags &#8211; TLS Mother Lode Mini</a>, a reviewer favorite made of 840D and 900D twisted poly.</p>

[table id=327 /]
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Fabric</h3>
<p>Duffel bags are mainly soft-sided and therefore prone to tearing when checked at the airport. So it’s important to choose one that&#8217;s made of sturdy fabric with a high denier count. Denier — the “D” you often see in fabric descriptions (such as 600D, 1200D, etc.) — is a measurement of fabric weight.</p>
<p>Generally, the higher the denier number, the stronger the fabric. However, the measurement is only good for comparing weights within one fabric category (for example, a 600D polyester is actually weaker than a 450D nylon, and so on).</p>
<p>Nylon is a great rip-resistant, durable fabric for luggage, with ballistic and Cordura nylon being the heaviest and sturdiest. Polyester is a more lightweight and less durable option; if you’re going to buy a poly duffel, look for one that’s at least 800D.</p>
<h3>Wheels</h3>
<p>Duffel bags come in two rolling variations: two-wheeled (rollers) and four-wheeled (spinners). Each has its pros and cons, and the choice ultimately comes down to personal preference.</p>
<h3>Two-wheeled</h3>
<p><b>Pros: </b>Wheels tend to be larger and recessed (meaning they’re better protected) and are easier to roll over a variety of surfaces than four-wheelers. They also can be rolled up flights of stairs (spinners have to be lifted up stairs) and can handle speedy maneuvering (like when you’re running to catch your flight at the airport) without catching.</p>
<p><b>Cons: </b>They can only roll forward and backward, and their recessed wheels take up space inside the bag.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Choose a two-wheeled duffel with the wheels placed a good distance apart. If they’re too close together, the bag will tip more easily from side to side.</p>
<h3>Four-wheeled</h3>
<p><b>Pros: </b>Spinners can swivel 360 degrees and be pushed ahead of you or pulled beside or behind you while upright. They don’t pull on the arm and shoulder.</p>
<p><b>Cons: </b>A spinner’s wheels are “on” at all times, so you will need to monitor your bag if you’re on even the slightest incline. Because the wheels aren’t recessed, they take up space in overhead bins and are more susceptible to damage.</p>

<p>To test our duffel contenders, we packed them with clothes, shoes, toiletries and other travel essentials to test capacity, compartment usability and general ease of packing. Then we dragged the duffels over various terrains (pavement, dirt, gravel and cobblestones) and up three flights of stairs to test the quality of their wheels and telescoping handles.</p>
<p>We also carried them by their other handles and lifted the carry-on duffels over our heads to gauge how easy it would be to place them in an overhead bin. We then rated the duffels using these metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive design</li>
<li>Ease of packing</li>
<li>Pockets and compartments</li>
<li>Materials and construction</li>
<li>Zippers</li>
<li>Wheel performance</li>
<li>Top, side and telescoping handles</li>
<li>Ability to stand upright</li>
<li>Aesthetic look</li>
</ul>

<p>The heavy-duty <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005OQZ5ZA/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FŪL &#8211; Tour Manager Deluxe</a> was the clear winner in the full-size category. Made of super-durable 1680D ballistic nylon, the FŪL has a split-level design with a hard-sided, water-resistant bottom. Its wide-set inline skate wheels make for a stable, balanced roll, and its telescoping handle extends smoothly and doesn’t wobble. We also like its heavy-duty oversized zippers, which are easy to grab and don’t catch.</p>
<p>All in all, the FŪL is a pleasure to pack. Duffel bags of this size can sometimes feel like black holes that require lots of digging to find the one thing you need. But the FŪL is thoughtfully segmented to prevent that. Among the outer pockets are two deep compartments at either end of the bag — one perfect for shoes or boots, and another next to the telescoping handle for stowing plane tickets, snacks, and other travel necessities.</p>
<p>The top half of the duffel is separated from the hard-sided bottom compartment by a zippered flap, so travelers have the option of dividing the bag into two self-contained compartments or leaving it as one large compartment accessible from the top opening. The hard sides of the bottom compartment make it especially easy to pack, since they stand upright and don’t fall in on themselves. The duffel’s top opening could be a bit larger for easier access, but it isn’t a dealbreaker.</p>

<p>One feature we found unnecessary and disappointing for such a well-designed bag is the mesh “window” in the middle of the bag’s separator flap. A solid, windowless flap would be a much sturdier choice for dividing the top and bottom compartments. We also wish there were a strap or pocket to stow the flap when unzipped, just to get it out of the way.</p>
<p>Weighing in at 10 pounds when empty, the FŪL is on the heavier side (the Olympia &#8211; Drop Bottom Rolling Duffel weighs about 6.5 pounds). However, if the duffel’s sturdy ballistic nylon and strong construction can hold their own on the tarmac, it’s worth the weight — especially since a similarly sized suitcase weighs about 12 pounds on average. When packed, the FŪL can stand upright on its own, though it did fall over about a third of the time during testing.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The FŪL &#8211; Tour Manager Deluxe is built heavily but solidly, with 1680D ballistic nylon, heavy-duty zippers and wide-set, strong wheels that roll smoothly.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s organized well to make good use of its interior space, with a special pocket for shoes and an interior divider flap to separate the bag into two large compartments.</li>
<li>The FŪL’s clamshell design features a hard-sided bottom that conveniently doesn’t collapse in on itself while packing.</li>

<p>Intuitively designed and loaded with well-thought-out features, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008MCZ224/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags &#8211; TLS Mother Lode Mini</a> may just be the perfect carry-on bag. The duffel’s exterior construction is well-designed and solid, remaining upright and refusing to fall over no matter how full we stuffed it (the bag even comes with optional interior rods that can be quickly installed to increase upright support). With large, corner-set inline skate wheels, the duffel rolls smoothly with minimal tipping.</p>
<p>The Mother Lode Mini has a total of four exterior handles, which made it easy to lift horizontally — essential for stowing a carry-on in a plane’s overhead compartment. The bag’s telescoping handle extends to three heights, making it comfortable to pull for travelers of various statures (and kids, too).</p>
<p>We appreciated its stowable strap for securing other luggage on top of the bag, as well as the ID tag tucked securely into a viewable mesh pocket. Even its zipper-pulls are specially designed, ergonomically shaped for the curves of the thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>Inside the bag, a zippered flap separates the clamshell duffel’s two compartments: a hard-sided bottom half and a soft upper compartment, which can also be accessed via the bag’s top opening. While the bottom half features an optional Velcroed divider, the top compartment includes compression straps that can function for the bag’s one-compartment and two-compartment options. The bag is expandable and also includes exterior compression straps.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005OQZ5ZA/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FŪL &#8211; Tour Manager Deluxe</a>, the duffel’s top opening is disappointingly small and cramped, especially when the interior divider flap is unzipped and you’re left with one large interior compartment. This may be our only criticism of the Mother Lode Mini, and since the bag functions best with its two compartments separated anyway, it’s not a dealbreaker. The trade-off is a hard-sided segment of the soft top compartment that hinders it from opening wider, but it also protects and further stabilizes the bottom of the bag.</p>
<p>In a perfect world the Mother Lode Mini would be made out of nylon rather than 840D and 900D twisted poly. However, polyester with those denier counts is plenty durable for a carry-on duffel.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The expandable eBags &#8211; TLS Mother Lode Mini is loaded with great features and perks designed especially for travelers, such as movable interior compartment dividers, an ID tag and even ergonomically designed zipper pulls.</li>
<li>The duffel stands up extremely well on its own due to a hard-sided bottom half that extends one-third of the way up the front of the bag. The bag also includes optional interior rods that can be installed for extra support.</li>
<li>This duffel features large, smooth-rolling inline skate wheels positioned at the corners of the bag to reduce tipping.</li>

<h3>Olympia &#8211; Drop Bottom Rolling Duffel</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25682" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olympia-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olympia-solo.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olympia-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olympia-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olympia-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olympia-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olympia-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olympia-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olympia-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olympia-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olympia-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olympia-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>With a cheaper price point, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010C61G8G/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Olympia &#8211; Drop Bottom Rolling Duffel</a> is a perfectly good bargain option. Though the Olympia’s 1500D polyester pales in comparison to the FŪL’s brawny 1680D ballistic nylon, the Olympia is lighter in weight, has a wider top opening for better visibility and is well-built for the price. Its inline skate wheels also performed well in our tests, though they aren’t as wide-set and stable as the FŪL’s.</p>
<h3>A. Saks &#8211; Expandable Wheeled Duffel</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25678" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-180x120.jpg 180w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a-saks-solo-320x213.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Made of 420D nylon, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HO8F8I/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A. Saks &#8211; Expandable Wheeled Duffel</a> is built like a traditional soft-sided duffel, with collapsible sides and no hard bottom. It rolls well, though its telescoping handle is a bit wobbly and a good couple of inches shorter than the eBags duffel. The A. Saks doesn’t stand up well on its end. We do like its extra cushy carrying handle, and the bag is expandable.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After assessing four top-rated rolling duffel bags, we named the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005OQZ5ZA/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FŪL &#8211; Tour Manager Deluxe</a> as our pick for best full-size duffel bag. The FŪL duffel won us over with its extremely durable ballistic nylon exterior, superior construction and great use of interior space. While we didn’t love the unnecessary mesh window in the bag’s interior divider flap, it wasn’t a dealbreaker for such a high-quality travel bag.</p>
<p>For the best rolling carry-on duffel bag, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D45H5P4/?tag=ybdduff-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eBags &#8211; TLS Mother Lode Mini</a> was our hands-down favorite, solidly built and packed with perks and features that made it a pleasure to test (despite its smallish zippered top opening).</p>

				<description><![CDATA[After testing four top-ranked options, the Brita - BB10 won our pick as the best filtered water bottle for safe-to-drink city water.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter using four top-ranked bottles at home, on the go and in the great outdoors, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H1F6N2F/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; BB10</a> won our pick as the best filtered water bottle for better taste from safe-to-drink city water. If you&#8217;re going out into the wilderness, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C6HAYCS/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grayl &#8211; Ultralight</a> is a purifying water bottle that removes organisms like bacteria and protozoa, as well as mineral contaminants like heavy metals.</p>
<h2>How we selected</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve tested a lot of water filters over the years, including <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">the best water filter pitchers</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-faucet-water-filter/">faucet filters</a>. Our staff has come to appreciate the taste of chlorine-free drinking water without the added expense of buying bottled water.</p>
<p>We looked for systems in two different classes:</p>
<p>First, we looked at filters that were designed to remove only bad-tasting elements like chlorine from treated, safe-to-drink water. The standards for this type of filter are fairly easy to meet, but they&#8217;re specific. An activated carbon block or column of granules will capture most of the stuff you can smell in city water.</p>
<p>Second, we looked at bottles designed for use in the back country and overseas travel, where the concern is more for biological contamination than taste. We consulted guides from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Center for Disease Control</a> and <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/pubs/pdf/hi_res/07231304hi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forest Service</a> to ensure we were checking for the right factors.</p>
<p>We narrowed our choices to bottles that had affordable replacement filters and were easy to purchase. A few other picks, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075X5R67T/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Katadyn &#8211; BeFree</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078WYNCZ5/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LifeSaver</a>, weren&#8217;t available when we tested and weren&#8217;t competitive with the LifeStraw on pricing despite using similar technologies.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<p><strong>Carbon filters</strong> &#8211; If you want a filter to remove the taste of chlorine and other volatile substances, activated carbon is economical and very effective. It isn&#8217;t effective at removing dissolved minerals, though, and the size of particles carbon passes through will depend on the design. Carbon filters soak up less and less contaminants the more they&#8217;re used, and they can&#8217;t be cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>Ion-exchange filters</strong> &#8211; If you want to remove the dissolved salts and metals in water, ion-exchange resin will grab them. Some new tests also show that this works to capture microbial contaminants. This is one of the technologies used in <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">Zero Water filter pitchers</a> to get rid of all dissolved solids. Like activated carbon, the filter is used up as it cleans water, but you can&#8217;t tell how much it has left unless you count the number of times you fill the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Particle filters</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re mostly worried about avoiding beaver fever while backpacking, a hollow-fiber or ceramic filter can be effective at removing everything from silt to tiny virus and bacteria organisms, depending on the size of the holes. In the extra-dense microbiological filters they require hand-pump pressure or hours-long gravity filtration to make questionable water safe. These filters are fairly easy to clean and continue using for a long time, but they don&#8217;t do much to improve the taste of city water or if you use treatment drops.</p>
<p><strong>Particulate ratings</strong> &#8211; NSF International and other water quality testers rate filters based on the largest compounds they can possibly let through. A smaller class number or absolute filter size will be more effective, but it will also stop working more quickly. Class I is the important class, since this means the filter stops particles larger than 0.5 microns, and that category includes some of the most worrisome organisms in mountain streams.</p>
<p><strong>Effectiveness against biological contaminants</strong> &#8211; Class I particulate ratings — or better still, testing that shows compliance with the NSF Standard 53 or 58 for “cyst reduction / removal” — mean filters can trap protozoan cysts like giardia or cryptosporidium. However, these filters might still let some bacteria (which can be as small as 0.2 microns) through. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/backcountry_water_treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC highly recommends</a> using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XVMZG2/?tag=ybdfilbot-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chlorine dioxide treatment</a> or just boiling water before you filter it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re travelling in populated areas, virus-size organisms are a bigger concern and require an even tighter, slower filter that meets <a href="https://www.msrgear.com/blog/water-101-decoding-water-filter-testing-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the strict P248 standard</a> for worst-case water supplies. That kind of filter requires a high-pressure hand pump or a slow gravity-drain mechanism.</p>
<p>Bottles like Grayl and Seychelle claim to be effective at removing viruses with ion-exchange filters, but they don&#8217;t publish the specifications of their tests and they&#8217;re definitely not P248-rated.</p>
<p><strong>Flow rating</strong> &#8211; The more quickly water flows through a filter, the easier it is to use. That&#8217;s almost always a trade-off with effectiveness, though. Also remember that if you use water that&#8217;s cloudy, the particles will plug up your filter more quickly and reduce the flow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hether you’re using them during a sweat session at the gym or to get through a hot summer day, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3017491/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a> show that cooling towels can significantly boost endurance levels. We put five top-rated cooling towels to the test to determine which ones perform best, wearing them while doing housework on a hot day, outside in the heat of the sun and during a workout at the gym.</p>
<p>The best cooling towel was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel</a>, a highly absorbent towel that kept us cool and comfortable for a span of two consecutive hours. We also chose the best cooling towel for sports — the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel</a>, a mesh poly blend towel that felt especially lightweight and breathable as it cooled us off during our gym time.</p>

<li><a href="#bottom">The bottom line</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected cooling towels to test</h2>
<p>To put together our lineup of test-worthy cooling towels, we first looked over the top-rated best-sellers on Amazon and searched for user recommendations on Reddit and YouTube. We also read through buyer reviews on Amazon to determine what cooling towel features were most important to users, which we then used to filter and narrow down the top towel choices on our list.</p>
<p>Out of those top picks, we chose towels that were highly rated on Amazon and under $30 each. We also made sure to test a variety of fabrics and materials — polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), 100% polyester and polyester-nylon blends — to determine which were most effective at cooling us down.</p>
<p>The final filtered list included two cooling towel giants: the ShamWow-like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IAUZ3LS/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frogg Toggs &#8211; Chilly Pad</a> and two cooling towels by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q7T3C3T/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mission</a>, an “instant cooling gear” brand touted by big-name athlete ambassadors like Serena Williams and Dwayne Wade.

<h2 id="how-they-work">How do cooling towels work?</h2>
<p>When a moistened cooling towel is placed around the neck or on any skin surface, evaporative cooling comes into play — the skin’s temperature causes the towel’s moisture particles to heat up and evaporate, further cooling down the temperature of the towel. The result is a refreshingly cooling feeling against the skin.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3017491/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> published in the <i>Journal of Athletic Training</i> found that those who wore a cooling towel during exercise could endure the workout longer because it changed the participants’ perception of how much thermal strain they were experiencing. In our own research, we found that cooling towels seem to be used by everyone from gym enthusiasts and festival-goers to menopausal women battling hot flashes and mothers giving birth.</p>
<p>Ideal for vacationers, golfers and those who work outside or in perpetually hot environments (such as chefs), cooling towels seem to take the edge off of a variety of overheated situations and help keep wearers cool during the summer months.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<h3>Fabric</h3>
<p>The fabric of the cooling towel you choose will depend largely on how you intend to use your towel. If you want to cool off without soaking your clothes, polyvinyl acetate (PVA) towels like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel</a> are great because they will retain moisture and cool you off without sacrificing your outfit. Mesh polyester blend or 100-percent polyester towels such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F6R5J9S/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mission &#8211; Enduracool Techknit Cooling Towel</a> have a wetter feel and tend to be drippier, so they’re better for use at the gym, during a sports activity or in any situation where you don’t mind your clothes getting a little wet.</p>
<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Cooling towels come in a variety of sizes, with some brands (such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel</a>) offering a broader range than others. A small-to-medium size (about 10–13 inches by 32–40 inches) is perfect for wearing around the neck during a workout. Larger-sized towels (14–30 inches by 41–60 inches) are great for keeping the entire body cool — after sports events, during heat waves, etc. Many cooling towels offer UPF sun protection, making them perfect for draping over the shoulders while outside in the sun.</p>
<h3>Washability and storage</h3>
<p>Since you will most likely want to wash your cooling towel often, it’s a good idea to pick one that can be conveniently thrown into the washing machine.</p>
<p>PVA fans, take heed: Since PVA dries to a hard, cardboard-like finish, you’ll want to wash your towel and then fold or roll it up while still wet. Attempting to fold or roll your towel after it dries may result in tearing. If you don’t need to fold or roll your towel for storage, feel free to lay it out flat to dry.</p>
<p>Some cooling towels come with storage pouches and even hooks to attach to your gym bag or backpack for easy transportation while wet or dry.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>To determine the best cooling towels out of our top five picks, our testers wore each towel around their neck and shoulders for a span of two consecutive hours while doing housework and yard work. We also wore them during gym sessions to find out how well they cooled us down while we were hot and sweaty. Our testers then rated the towels using the following criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>After wetting/activating the cooling towel with room-temperature water, how long does it actually stay cool?</li>
<li>How cool does it feel against the skin (without re-wetting) within the first 10 minutes of use? Within the first 30 minutes? Within the first hour?</li>
<li>How pleasant does the towel’s fabric feel against the skin?</li>
<li>Does it get clothes wet, or do they remain dry during use?</li>
<li>How well do the size and shape of the towel work for its intended purpose?</li>
<li>Is it machine washable?</li>
<li>How easy is it to store?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-overall">Best overall: Chill Pal</h2>

<p>Our pick for best cooling towel overall is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel</a>, which remained moist and cool throughout our testing periods, didn’t get our clothes wet and was soft and comfortable to wear. Made of cushy polyvinyl acetate (PVA), the Chill Pal feels buttery against the skin, with one side textured and the other smooth. Its 12 inch by 32 inch size was ideal for draping easily around our neck or over our shoulders.</p>
<p>After soaking it in water and wringing it out according to the directions, the towel immediately felt cool against our neck and retained that coolness for the next hour of use. In the hour following that, the towel did begin to warm slightly, but we were impressed by how long it remained moist — well beyond our two-hour consecutive testing period — and even more impressed that it only lightly dampened our shirt during that time.</p>

<p>As a PVA cooling towel, the Chill Pal dries stiff. Though it can be washed cold in the washing machine, it shouldn’t be dried in the dryer. We recommend folding or rolling the towel while it’s still moist and pliable, and then air-drying it to prevent molding before storing it in its pouch.</p>
<p>Priced at about $13, the Chill Pal comes with a storage pouch and carabiner, so it can be clipped onto your bag or backpack before and after use. Because it does an excellent job of cooling the body down without soaking your outfit, we recommend it for those who need to cool down at work, while out and about on a hot day (Disneyland, anyone?) or during house and yard work.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel impressed us with its marathon moisture retention.</li>
<li>The towel remained cool longer than any of the others in our testing lineup.</li>
<li>Because it leaches little to no water onto clothing, the Chill Pal is ideal for use at work or in situations where you need to preserve your outfit.</li>
<li>Since it dries stiff, you need to air dry and roll it up while it is still pliable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lightweight, soft and breathable, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel</a> is our top choice for a cooling towel to use while at the gym or during sports. After we “activated” (wet) the towel with water, it remained cool against our skin throughout our hour-long workout.</p>
<p>Made of 45% polyester and 55% polyamide mesh, the Alfamo is not as absorbent as the Chill Pal PVA towel and therefore doesn’t distribute moisture evenly throughout the towel for long, making it a bit drippy. However, we found the wetter quality of the towel to be especially refreshing while working out and a non-issue for gym clothes, since we were already sweaty. We also like that the Alfamo offers UPF 50 sun protection, which will come in handy for those who exercise outdoors.</p>

<p>The Alfamo gets extra points for its sizing variety; while the other towels in our lineup only come in one or two sizes, Alfamo offers four different sizes: 11 by 33 inches, 13 by 40 inches, 14 by 47 inches and 29 by 60 inches, priced from around $8 for the smallest size to about $27 for the largest.</p>
<p>Like the Chill Pal towel, the Alfamo comes with a waterproof storage pouch and carabiner for easy transportability. The towel is machine washable, and can be dried in the dryer on low heat. Bonus: Alfamo also offers a lifetime guarantee on their towels.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Light and breathable, the Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel was the perfect weight to wear while exercising.</li>
<li>The towel’s polyester blend delivered slightly more moisture when wet, which provided extra cooling power during sweaty workouts.</li>
<li>The Alfamo offers four different sizes to wear around the neck, shoulders, torso or entire body.</li>
<li>It’s not as absorbent as PVA towels, meaning it’s a bit drippy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After testing five highly rated cooling towels indoors, outdoors and at the gym, we narrowed our picks down to two favorites. Our favorite cooling towel overall, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKLYWFU/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chill Pal &#8211; PVA Cooling Towel</a>, holds moisture for an impressive amount of time without leaking onto clothes, cooling us off for two hours straight and keeping our outfit intact. For sports and working out, we recommend the airy, mesh <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010T9RL2G/?tag=ybdctowel-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alfamo &#8211; Cooling Towel</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter four weeks of testing five best-selling models in the summer heat, we&#8217;ve concluded that electric coolers are not actually very good at keeping things cold.

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>After searching for reviews, we found that only a few sites have really compared and tested electric coolers. We relied on the comparison from OutdoorGearLab to set our expectations, which is to say we realized that many buyers aren&#8217;t happy with these coolers.</p>
<p>We searched for coolers that customers liked most, and found a set of five with fairly good reviews and a similar set of features. We wanted to compare with a 45-quart ice-filled cooler from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">cooler review</a>, so we settled on that size as a baseline.</p>
<p>We specifically looked for an upgraded or higher-tier cooler to compare with mainstream models, and settled on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HXJS6H/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dometic &#8211; TC35-DC-A</a> because of its thermostat control. Dometic isn&#8217;t the only company selling a model like this, but they have a good reputation among RV and van enthusiasts.</p>
<p>We also bought two smaller coolers with high review counts — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27 Voyager</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007ZYH4BM/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Igloo &#8211; Iceless 28 Quart</a> — that we could use as a comparison for the effect of cooler capacity on cooling performance.</p>

<p>An electric cooler is a bit like the traditional <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">insulated ice chest coolers that we&#8217;ve reviewed before</a>, but it uses a thermoelectric “Peltier” device to move heat out of the cooler rather than absorbing it into ice.</p>
<p>The device itself seems almost too good to be true: Electricity carries heat from one side of a semiconductor pad to the other. Interestingly, that means if you reverse the polarity of the power cable, most of these coolers will turn into heaters.</p>
<p>These are usually advertised as &#8220;ice-free&#8221; coolers, and that&#8217;s how we used and tested them. You could add sealed gel ice packs to an electric cooler to help it absorb more heat, but dumping in a bag of ice can cause electrical shorts and isn&#8217;t recommended.</p>
<h3>Limitations of electric coolers</h3>
<p>There are two factors that limit the effectiveness of an electric cooler: the thermoelectric mechanism itself and the effectiveness of insulation.</p>
<p>The bigger the device and the more amperes of current you push through it, the more heat it can move. There are limits, though: Most thermoelectric systems can only change the temperature on one side by 30 or 40 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the problem of getting rid of all that heat on the outside: All the models we tested use an aluminum heatsink and fan to dissipate the heat once it&#8217;s on the outside of the cooler. Better performance would require larger, more complex heat-dissipation systems.</p>
<p>Coolers for drinks and snacks have another major hurdle to overcome. Even when the cooler has good insulation, If you’re opening the lid constantly, the heat rushing in makes efficiency quite poor.</p>
<h3>Power draw of electric coolers</h3>

<p>The coolers we tested are designed to only use 5 amps of 12-volt power, which is about the same draw as one headlight. That&#8217;s low enough that it won&#8217;t kill your battery over a short stop.</p>
<p>The battery for our tester&#8217;s Honda Odyssey minivan is rated for two hours of reserve capacity at 25 amps, so we could theoretically run one of these coolers for 8 hours before the battery would hit the bottom quarter of reserve life. You don&#8217;t ever want to go that low on the same battery you&#8217;re starting your vehicle with, though.</p>
<p>On a dedicated deep-cycle battery you can get away with more use, but most of us don&#8217;t have one of those in the car. These coolers are really only designed for active cooling while you&#8217;re driving or when you have access to a 120-volt AC outlet. (120-volt operation requires <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009PUQ3C/?tag=ybdecool-20">a separate adapter</a> not included with most electric coolers.)</p>
<h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and cons of electric coolers</h2>
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Electric coolers don’t require making or buying ice to keep lunch and drinks cool (or hot) while you&#8217;re driving.</li>
<li>No ice means no water soaking into your lunch.</li>
<li>Thermoelectric coolers are far less expensive than compressor-type refrigerators.</li>
<li>Fewer moving parts means that these coolers should be more reliable (or at least easier to repair) than refrigerators.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>An electric cooler won&#8217;t chill enough to protect raw meat on a hot day.</li>
<li>Most models aren&#8217;t as easy to clean as a good ice chest.</li>
<li>A thermoelectric cooler needs to run constantly, so it actually drains your battery faster when parked than a 12-volt compact fridge would.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vs-regular-coolers">Ice chests vs. electric coolers</h2>
<p>For the sizes that we tested, manufacturers rated the cooler performance at 40 degrees lower than the temperature outside the cooler, but that assumes a lot of things.</p>
<p>if you need to keep food (or anything else) below 40 degrees, you’d be better off using ice. When surrounded with ice, perishables are protected from heat for two or three days. So long as your food is in a waterproof container, even melted ice will typically keep food at safe temperatures for another day or so.</p>
<p>If you’re only keeping drinks chilled, or if you’re transporting something like medication that’s safe up to room temperature, an electric cooler will help you out without the constant re-stocking that makes ice inconvenient.</p>
<p>Adding frozen gel packs can help level the playing field between electric and regular coolers, but of course that still requires you to have access to a freezer.</p>
<h2 id="vs-fridges">Electric coolers vs refrigerators</h2>
<p>The key advantage that a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072MLT6QW/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">12-volt refrigerator like this 50-watt model from Dometic</a> has over a thermoelectric cooler is that it can keep your food cold even in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Refrigerators use a coolant (like R-22, the modern replacement for Freon gas) that changes from liquid to gas inside a coiled metal tube. That process sucks all the heat out of your fridge very efficiently. A compressor makes that gas liquid again for another pass through the coil, and as the process repeats indefinitely, it can move an amazing amount of heat.</p>
<p>This phase-change system still works well on an incredibly hot day, but all those moving parts make a 12-volt fridge more expensive than a thermoelectric cooler.</p>
<p>Thermoelectric coolers will chill your drinks or help keep your lunch cold while your AC is on while you&#8217;re driving, but they need a constant supply of power. Reading <a href="http://campinnforum.com/community/threads/12v-120v-freezer-fridge.3816/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user testimonials about real-world use of 12-volt fridges and freezers</a>, it&#8217;s clear that the more expensive systems are more efficient at keeping things cold, but they still need extra battery capacity to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>Another big difference between an electric fridge and a thermoelectric cooler will be the built-in thermostat. A fridge cools quickly in short bursts to maintain a steady average temperature, while a thermoelectric cooler will need to run constantly and still not hit 40 degrees Fahrenheit on a hot day.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Internal size:</b> The size of a cooler is usually measured in quarts. The best way to keep food cool is to pack the cooler&#8217;s space full of pre-chilled or frozen beverages, so pick a size you&#8217;ll really use.</p>
<p><b>Shape:</b> Most coolers are roughly box-shaped, but some are designed to fit in between front bucket seats if you have that configuration in your vehicle.</p>
<p><b>Door orientation: </b>Coolers can be made to open upward, like an ice chest, or sideways, like a fridge. Some can work in both positions, but generally the top-opening models are the most versatile and popular.</p>
<p><b>Dividers and shelves:</b> If you have food that should be stored at different temperatures, large full-featured coolers should come with slide-in pieces that will help you keep specific items closer to or farther away from the cooling element.</p>
<p><b>Power draw:</b> Your vehicle&#8217;s battery has some reserve capacity, but you don&#8217;t want to risk getting stranded by using that all up. Higher power means better cooling power, though available models we looked at only differ by about 20 percent.</p>
<p><b>Thermostatic control: </b>A built-in thermostat will turn a premium cooler on and off to try and maintain a set temperature. This will save power if you&#8217;re only using it in an air-conditioned car or on a cloudy day, but in a heat wave it&#8217;ll be running full-time anyhow.</p>
<p><b>Drain plug: </b>This isn&#8217;t as critical a feature as it is for regular ice-filled coolers, but it still makes rinsing out an electric cooler much easier.</p>
<p><b>Heating mode:</b> Most thermoelectric coolers can be switched from chilling to heating simply by reversing the polarity of the power plug, moving heat into the cooler instead of out. This is a nifty perk if you&#8217;re delivering lunches, but our test crew agreed that they&#8217;d rarely use it.</p>

<p>We set up our group of coolers on the patio for six days of 90-plus-degree weather. Each cooler was loaded with a pack of hot dogs, a pair of yogurt cups, and a water bottle. All items were refrigerated to about 40° F before we loaded up the coolers, but the coolers themselves had been sitting in 80° outdoor temperatures.</p>
<p>The coolers were running off of household electrical power for this test, which required the use of adapters not included with most coolers.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re storing or transporting perishable food for more than a few hours, 40 degrees is the hottest temperature that will still stop bacteria from multiplying and keep your food safe.</p>
<p>We checked temperatures with an instant-read probe thermometer in the morning and afternoon, but we also tracked changes over the week with two SensorPush wIreless data-logging thermometers.</p>
<p>For a control, we loaded the top-ranked model from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">review of the best coolers</a>, the ORCA &#8211; 40 Quart Classic, with 20 pounds of ice and checked its temperature at the same time.</p>
<div id="visualizer-24388-2114740939" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-24388"></div>
<p>The first day of the test was overcast, with temperatures starting at 80 degrees and dropping to the mid 70s. This is close to the conditions inside the back of a car or truck, and the coolers did not perform as well as we&#8217;d hoped. After two hours, temperatures in most of the coolers stabilized at a mere fifteen degrees colder than outside air. The high starting temperature of the coolers just couldn&#8217;t be overcome by the thermoelectric systems.</p>
<p>As expected, the temperatures in the evening were much better, finally dropping down below 40 and even freezing in one unit when outside temperatures were in the 60s overnight. But that&#8217;s still not the performance necessary to keep perishable items like potato salad safe if you have to unplug when you&#8217;re stopped.</p>
<div id="visualizer-24394-125325372" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-24394"></div>
<p>When we looked at the temperatures from the two data-log thermometers, it was clear that the insulation and cooling power of these coolers is insufficient for use outside on a hot day. As soon as the sun hit the spot they were sitting at around 10 a.m., the temperature would climb above 50 in a better cooler or all the way up to 70 in a cheaper cooler. Things only dropped again when outside temperatures fell below 70 overnight.</p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t expecting these coolers to perform well in the hot sun, but look at these results and think about what conditions you&#8217;ll actually be using your cooler in.</p>
<p>Ice and bear-proof insulation like you&#8217;ll find on <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">the best coolers we&#8217;ve reviewed</a> are still far superior to a small thermoelectric device when it comes to keeping the heat out of your food.</p>
<p>That goes double when you consider that ice doesn&#8217;t need electricity to do its job. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009PUQ3C/?tag=ybdecool-20">A 120-volt adapter</a> will help if you&#8217;ve got power hookups or a hotel room overnight, but that&#8217;s not usually an option if you&#8217;re camping.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27</a> has the best combination of size and performance. With the best cooling performance on a 90-degree day, this 29-quart cooler will help keep your food and drinks cool.</p>
<p>Koolatron makes a wide range of electric cooler sizes, from a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JLNBW4/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tiny six-pack chiller</a> to a full <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q754E4/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">45-quart party cooler</a>. We picked the P27 based on reputation among reviewers, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint. This cooler is an ideal size for family road trips, holding a two-liter bottle along with a few days&#8217; worth of snacks.</p>
<p>This cooler kept coldest on hot days during our test, but it&#8217;ll still allow the contents to get up around 50 degrees sitting outside on a 100-degree day. That&#8217;s fine for chilling drinks and a packed lunch you&#8217;re going to eat the same day, but if you&#8217;ve got your vehicle parked in the sun for any amount of time it won&#8217;t keep dairy products safe.</p>

The cooling performance was also the best we saw among all the coolers we tested. It's still not as cold as ice, but it's more convenient.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>If you do want to keep food below 40 degrees in this cooler, there are a few essential tricks you&#8217;ll need to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t leave the empty cooler in the car when it&#8217;s parked in the sun; take it with you so it starts out at room temperature rather than baking-hot.</li>
<li>Use frozen water bottles and gel packs whenever you can to help absorb heat on a hot day. Yes, that makes this a barely-upgraded ice chest, rather than a truly iceless cooler, but it will help keep your food safe. Don&#8217;t dump ice inside or get this cooler wet, though.</li>
<li>Make sure there&#8217;s some room for air to move inside the cooler and chill everything evenly. If you want to sort the items from most temperature sensitive to least sensitive, that will help too, but watch out for items sitting beside the chiller fan getting frozen.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;re just carrying lunch and a drink every day, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009PGNS/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">18-quart Koolatron P-20</a> is a better buy, since it&#8217;s slim enough to fit between the front seats of a van or truck with bucket seats. But if you&#8217;ve got room for this bigger cube-shaped cooler, it&#8217;s more versatile.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking at buying anything bigger than the P27, you&#8217;ve got to seriously ask yourself if mediocre cooling performance will be worthwhile. Thermoelectric coolers are an excellent choice for drinks, but milk and other quick-spoiling food will need extra ice packs or some different kind of cooling solution.</p>
<p>One final note about quality: While we don&#8217;t have any complaints about the electronics or operation of this cooler, the Koolatron label was not applied carefully at the factory. Also, the plastic slide-lock is pretty stiff and flimsy. There was also tape residue on the side of the cooler we bought. This is a good cooler, but it&#8217;s not a shining example of quality control.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The size and performance of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27</a> is better than the other models we tested.</li>
<li>While the Koolatron is better at cooling than the others we tested, it&#8217;s still no match for a 100-degree heat wave even when plugged in.</li>
<li>This cube-shaped cooler can sit so the door opens to the side or from the top.</li>
<li>For taking drinks and food on a small picnic, this is excellent.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a cooler that has a bit more room, the 45-quart  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagan &#8211; EL6244</a> has the right features and design to make the most of thermoelectric technology.</p>
<p>Compared to the size of the Koolatron &#8211; P27, the Wagan is just less than double the length. The lid opens in two sections, and you also get a set of wheels and an expanding handle to help cart all your drinks around.</p>
<p>With enough carrying capacity for two full 24-pack flats of beverage cans, this is a great cooler for tailgating. Note, however, that if you fill this cooler completely with warm beer or soda, it will probably never be able to cool them as well as it all off the way a refrigerator wcould. Always chill your food or drinks at home before you pack an electric cooler.</p>

<p>Like every other model we tested, the temperature spikes we measured inside this cooler during the hottest parts of the day were extreme. On a 100-degree day, the thermoelectric components can only keep the contents of this cooler at 54 degrees.</p>
<p>If you just want to keep your beverages at a more refreshing temperature without dealing with ice, it&#8217;ll do just fine. If you want to pack this with food and take it to a party, make sure you carefully pack the most perishable items next to a frozen water bottle or ice pack.</p>

<p>Other extra features that make this cooler stand out are removable dividers and a drain plug. The drain probably hurts insulation a bit, but it&#8217;s very nice for easy clean-out after a longer trip. The dividers make all the difference when you&#8217;re trying to keep your perishable items close to the chiller unit and want to fill up empty space with heat-absorbing frozen water bottles.</p>
<p>Another perk is built-in storage for the power cord: Tthe standard arrangement on most models is a little pig-tail electrical cord sticking out the side or a flush-mount socket, but Wagan tucks all the connections inside a pop-open door on the lid. The lid itself might crack if you let this cooler roll around in the back of a truck, but it keeps electrical connections safe from damage and keeps your cord from getting lost.</p>
<p>Despite the bigger size and extra features, the Wagan usually sells for about $15 less than the half-size Koolatron. It&#8217;s tricky to suggest that this is going to be a better pick for most people, though, since it did get 6 degrees warmer on a hot day.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagan &#8211; EL6244</a> is a bigger, better-equipped 45- quart cooler.</li>
<li>The lower price of the Wagan reflects performance, cooling is in the middle of the pack.</li>
<li>Wheels will help you move food and drinks around when you reach your perfect picnic spot.</li>
<li>Internal dividers are great at keeping your food and drinks separate.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HXJS6H/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dometic &#8211; TC35-DC-A</a> is a cooler with extra features that might justify its cost among a select group of buyers, but in terms of pure functionality it’s not doing much extra. The main feature to note is a thermostat, which will allow you to fine-tune the internal temperature and save power.</p>
<p>Dometic is well-known for their RV and trailer accessories: Ffrom fridges to air conditioners, Dometic products are all designed to make life on the road a little bit more luxurious. Compared to the full-power portable freezers Dometic sells, the TC35 is just not all that compelling despite the lower price.</p>
<p>The Dometic kept our lunches cooler than the Wagan, but not as cold as the Koolatron.</p>

<p>The one extra feature that separates it from the rest of this lineup is a digital thermostat: you can set a range of temperature controls to fine-tune the cold (or heat) from the thermoelectric plate.</p>
<p>With a seven-step range between freezing and 60 degrees Ffahrenheit when in cooling mode, this is the kind of control that might make the Dometic really useful when transporting something temperature-sensitive that can&#8217;t freeze and can&#8217;t get too hot.</p>
<p>That kind of control sounds great, but like a speedometer on your minivan that goes up to 300 miles per hour, it&#8217;s misleading. The ability of this cooler to hit anything below 50 degrees is dependent more on the outside temperature than on the controls.</p>

It was pretty good at keeping things cold, but not good enough to justify the price.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HXJS6H/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The lid on the Dometic seals securely, which is great for insulation performance, but the spring latch is pretty stiff, and our tester accidentally left the lid cracked open during one afternoon of testing because he didn&#8217;t push down hard enough.</p>
<p>Dometic was the only manufacturer to include an AC 120-volt power adapter with their cooler. Cheap 5-amp adapters are easy to source, but it was a nice touch.</p>
<p>Dometic&#8217;s build quality is actually right in line with the higher price you&#8217;re paying, which is nice to see. Everything about this cooler is a little bit more rigid and carefully finished. Where other coolers feel like boxes of plastic with cooling modules glued to the side, this feels like a product someone set out to design.</p>
<p>That said, a nice-looking cooler that doesn&#8217;t keep your egg salad sandwich from spoiling on a hot day isn&#8217;t where we&#8217;d recommend spending extra money. The Wagan is just as nice to use, if you don&#8217;t need a thermostat to keep your cooler from freezing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000Q754E4/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P95</a> is a larger 45-quart version of our 29-quart top pick, and it has one nice feature that sets it apart: aA two-position shelf that keeps food and drinks organized in layers or sections for easier access. That&#8217;s especially handy if you&#8217;re using this cooler so the door opens sideways, like a fridge.</p>
<p>Unlike the P27, though, the P95 had terrible cooling performance. Given that it&#8217;s probably the same components in a larger box that shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising, but the other large coolers performed better.</p>

<p>With the smallest internal capacity and the lowest price, the Igloo &#8211; Iceless 28 Quart cooler was also able to get our test lunch to the lowest temperature on an overcast summer day. The Igloo was truly freezing cold at 25.9 degrees on a 65-degree afternoon.</p>
<p>That performance was followed up with a flop, though, as the Igloo failed to get below 64 degrees on the following 97-degree day.</p>
<p>The cooling element had built up some frost during the extra-cold day that we assumed might account for some of the poor performance. Even after the frost was thoroughly melted the next day it was clear that the Igloo just didn&#8217;t have the insulation to keep its cool.</p>
<p>If your requirements are flexible and you just want a cheap cooler, the Igloo is not a bad design overall, with a useful carry handle and a good-looking exterior. Don&#8217;t set anything heavy on the lid, though, or the head-dissipating fan inside will start to rub on the plastic shroud.</p>
<p>The Igloo is the only cooler that we tested which fits comfortably between the front seats of our tester&#8217;s minivan, but that&#8217;s not enough to make it a good buy. After thorough testing, we&#8217;d check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U6YTMRM/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">small coolers from Wagan</a> before we&#8217;d settle on the Igloo for this role.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After thoroughly testing these electric coolers side-by-side with our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-coolers/">best-in-class ice-filled cooler</a>, we&#8217;re fairly disappointed in all of them.</p>
<p>Despite claims that an electric cooler can get 40 degrees below ambient temperatures, we mostly saw temperatures that would quickly lead to spoiled food over the course of a long trip. You also need to supply 12-volt power constantly to keep things cold, or treat the electric cooler like a regular cooler and pack it with frozen items anyhow.</p>
<p>If you only need to keep pre-chilled food and drinks cold while you&#8217;re driving on long trips, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001MQ7DQ/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koolatron &#8211; P27 Voyager</a> is the top performer. This 29-quart model stayed coldest throughout our testing, and it&#8217;s a useful size for carrying picnic-sized meals.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something a little bit bigger, the 46-quart <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072PRFQL3/?tag=ybdecool-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wagan &#8211; EL6244</a> has wheels, dividers and a drain feature that makes clean-up easier. It sacrifices cooling performance, but the price is also slightly lower.</p>

<h2 id="compare">Compare the best gas grills</h2>
[table id=290 /]
<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected gas grills to test</h2>
<p>Many manufacturers of gas grills frequently update or improve their models, so we looked for gas grills that would not likely be replaced in a couple of years. Although these upgrades are often minor, we focused on grills that manufacturers had released in 2018-2019.</p>
<p>If you have a couple thousand in expendable cash, you could plunk it down on a high-end <a href="https://www.napoleon.com/en/us/grills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Napoleon</a>, which has years’-long warranties. A Napoleon, however, may be out of the average consumer’s price range, so we instead we researched the moderately expensive Webers, one of the leaders in the industry.</p>
<p>Weber has several series of gas and charcoal grills — each with a lofty name, like Summit, Genesis and Master-Touch — and we chose to test the Spirit II, since its features are similar to less-expensive brands.</p>
<p>Our tester then personally checked out all of the grills sold at Home Depot and Lowe’s, and since we wanted an equitable test, we selected grills that we believed would be a fair match against the Weber. (For the record, we also considered grills sold at Target, but the selection only included older models.)</p>
<p>To be comparable with the Weber, the grills needed to have at least three burners, two side shelves, approximately the same size cook space (475 square inches) and at least 30,000 BTUs. (If you want to know more about BTUs — British Thermal Units — and their importance, check out our review of the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-portable-air-conditioner/#btucalculator">best portable air conditioner</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, we kept to a budget of no more than $300 each for the other two finalists. Models with cabinets are more expensive, so we chose models that had carts instead. Both the Char-Broil Performance and <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dyna-Glo-4-Burner-Open-Cart-LP-Gas-Grill-in-Black-DGF493PNP-D/302774519" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyna-Glo</a> are highly rated by consumers and are available in two to five-burner models. Oddly, Char-Broil’s price decreases with the larger models, and we chose the five-burner for a very reasonable $199 and the comparably priced four-burner Dyna-Glo.</p>
<h2 id="assemble">Assembling a gas grill</h2>
<p>First off, if there’s an offer (from whichever store you purchased the grill) for free assembly, grab it. Unless you really enjoy building things from nuts and bolts, be forewarned that assembling a gas grill requires two people and two hours of time. Lowe’s sells the Char-Broil fully assembled, so we paid the service charge for its delivery. Amazon usually charges for assembly, but for the Weber, it was free at the time we purchased it. However, since this service might not be available in your location, we decided to assemble the Weber and the Dyna-Glo ourselves to compare difficulty.</p>
<p>The Weber’s shipping weight is 116 pounds, and even with two people, it would be back-breaking to lift and carry the boxed Weber from the driveway to the backyard. So we unpacked and constructed it in the driveway. Although all of the pieces and hardware looked like we were about to put the disassembled Tin Woodsman back together, the Weber’s instructions were detailed and specific. Tools were required (not included), but everything fit perfectly into position.</p>
<p>Assembling the Dyna-Glo was a completely different experience. It weighs less than 65 pounds, because its materials are so much less substantial. The Dyna-Glo’s hood was encased in styrofoam for shipping, but it was dented in several spots. Metal splinters came off its side panels, and its framework was so flimsy, we worried it would not support the grill box. Surprisingly, it held, but the Dyna-Glo’s sturdiness didn’t compare well with the Weber’s.</p>
<h2 id="how-tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Each grill had an igniter button, and following their manual’s lighting instructions, we preheated the grills to 500°F, which took between 10-15 minutes. We then cooked hamburgers, steak and chicken on each grill in the same way.</p>
<h3>Hamburgers</h3>

<p>We put four beef hamburgers on each quadrant of the cooking grate to determine whether the grill was hotter in the back, sides or front. We seared the burgers for three minutes, turned them and using a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-digital-meat-thermometer/">digital meat thermometer</a>, cooked them to medium-rare, between 140°F and 145°F. We let the burgers rest five minutes before cutting into them.</p>
<h3>Steak</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23812" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/measuring-steak-temps-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Next, we heated the grills back up to 500°F (there was always heat loss when the grill hoods were opened) and seared one-inch-thick New York strip steaks (seasoned only with Kosher salt and black pepper) on both sides for three minutes. We then lowered the heat and continued to cook them, turning frequently, until the digital meat thermometer hit 135°F. We took the steaks off the grill and allowed them to rest 10 minutes before cutting into them.</p>

<p>We spatchcocked a whole chicken, cut it in half and seasoned each half with Kosher salt and black pepper. Then we turned off two or four burners, depending on how many burners each grill had, and cooked the chicken with indirect heat by putting the chicken on the unlit burners for 30 minutes. When the leg and thigh were cooked through, we transferred the chicken to the lit burner and crisped up the skin until it was golden brown.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Char-Broil-Performance-Black-And-Stainless-5-Burner-Liquid-Propane-Gas-Grill-with-1-Side-Burner/1000523547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Char-Broil &#8211; Performance &#8211; 463347519</a> five-burner gas grill that we tested had a couple of minor design flaws, but otherwise it grilled everything virtually the same as our upgrade pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weber Spirit II &#8211; E-310</a>, and actually bested the Weber in our steak competition with a better sear. At only $199, it’s a fantastic value for this well-made and sturdy grill that we believe will last you several grilling seasons.</p>
<p>Let’s get the design flaws out of the way. Its temperature gauge is located on top of the hood, so we couldn’t easily see the temperature without getting closer and looking directly down at the gauge. Second, the hood has a stainless steel handle that gets searingly hot when grabbed near the curvature close to the lid.</p>
<p>Physically, the Char-Broil has some of the same features as the Weber: porcelain-coated cast-iron cooking grates, recessed porcelain-coated flame tamers — which vaporize grease and force excess grease to drip below — and a tapered drip pan that funnels grease to a small tray underneath the fire box.</p>
<p>The Char-Broil took five minutes longer to heat up than the Weber and Dyna-Glo, but when it hit 500°F, it maintained that temperature and distributed the heat evenly throughout its 475-square-inch cooking space.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with grilling, then you know it’s vital to monitor how quickly food is cooking and, if necessary, adjust the heat or move food to the upper rack so it doesn’t burn. We didn’t need to do either with the Char-Broil. The heat stayed consistent, and there were no flare-ups or hot spots. It wasn’t quite “set-it-and-forget-it” cooking, but it was definitely stress-free.</p>

<p>The hamburger we placed in the rear of the cooking space cooked a little faster than the burger in the front, but we simply switched them, and they finished at the same time as the burgers on the sides. The indirect-heat method worked very well with the chicken, which was cooked through and juicy. The steak was a wonder: It seared beautifully, and the fat crisped to a delicious golden brown.</p>

<p>The five-burner Char-Broil also has a side burner with 10,000 BTUs, which can be used for sauteing onions or peppers or making a pan sauce for your grilled meats and vegetables. It measures 53 inches wide and 26 inches deep, so if it’s too large for your patio, the Char-Broil &#8211; Performance is also available in several sizes and styles, like a compact <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HID4Y7Q/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">two-burner with cabinet</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZV24HV/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a stainless steel four-burner, cart-style</a> (like the model we tested), and for $400, a <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Char-Broil-Performance-Stainless-6-Burner-Liquid-Propane-Gas-Grill-with-1-Side-Burner/1000713050" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six-burner with side burner</a> and a 15,000 BTU sear burner.</p>
<p>If you’re considering buying a Weber, but you can’t justify its high price, the Char-Broil &#8211; Performance is an excellent, more affordable option.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Char-Broil &#8211; Performance- 463347519 is a well-made and sturdy propane-gas grill with some of the same features as a comparable Weber, but it’s half the price.</li>
<li>It maintained and evenly distributed heat over its entire 475-square-inch cooking area during our tests.</li>
<li>The Char-Broil &#8211; Performance seared steak and burgers to perfection and slow-cooked chicken so it had juicy meat and crispy skin.</li>
<li>A couple of minor design flaws — a misplaced temperature gauge, for one — aren’t deal-breakers.</li>

<p>On grill forums, diehard Weber fans state that any Weber — charcoal or gas — is the best grill money can buy. Other people, however, question why Webers are much more expensive than other grills. We were intrigued as to what made a Weber grill so special.</p>
<p>We selected the moderately expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weber Spirit II &#8211; E-310</a> to test, and its performance was excellent, but it did not surpass the Char-Broil. Weber’s build quality, however, can’t be beat, so if you can afford a Weber — and the latest models with infrared are pretty pricey — then we can easily recommend the Weber Spirit II &#8211; E-310 as our upgrade pick.</p>
<p>Free assembly was offered when we bought on Amazon, but if it’s not available where you live, or if you really want to get a sense of how well a Weber is constructed, try assembling it yourself. A Weber’s parts and materials are hefty, and even when we had it together, rolling it to the patio was like pushing a wheelbarrow of bricks. Our advice is to build it where it will live.</p>
<p>Weber aggressively markets their patented GS4 technology, consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infinity Ignition, which Weber guarantees will light every time</li>
<li>Flavorizer bars, similar to Char-Broil’s flame tamers</li>
<li>Tapered burners, which heat evenly across the entire 529-square-inch cooking space</li>
<li>Grease-management system, again similar to Char-Broil’s, in which a tapered pan forces the grease to drip into a tray with a replaceable foil inset.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Spirit also has a unique device that attaches to the propane tank and indicates the level of propane gas inside the tank. The temperature gauge is located on the front of the hood, so it’s easy to see the grill’s internal temperature (when the lid is closed) even from across the patio.</p>
<p>The Spirit heats up fast and maintains the temperature, until the hood is opened to flip or turn the food you’re grilling. Each time we lifted the hood, the grill’s internal temperature dropped 100 degrees. Once the hood was closed again, the grill rapidly reheated.</p>

We did notice, however, that the Spirit was slightly hotter in the back of the grill and less hot on the left side. We accommodated this discrepancy by shifting food towards the center or far right, when we wanted to sear the steak.</p>
<p>Overall, we were impressed by the Spirit’s design and can understand why Webers have a passionate following. The Spirit — and all Weber models — are built to last in most climates, and anecdotally, its devotees claim their Webers are still going strong after ten years, which is remarkable, considering many grills collapse into rust when exposed to the elements for a year or two.</p>
<p>The Spirit II series is also available in the same price range as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTFDG7/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">red two-burner</a>, and for $150 more, a sleek and modernistic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0098HR1FI/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">black three-burner</a> with a cabinet.</p>
<p>Weber’s new Genesis II series is nearly double the price of the Spirit II series for a three-burner grill, but its additional features include a side burner, stainless-steel grates (instead of porcelain-enameled) and Weber&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H6193C8/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iGrill 3 smart technology</a> that allows you to monitor the grill&#8217;s internal temperature with an app.</p>
<p>For its durability, design and performance, we think the Weber is worth the high price tag.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s expensive, but the Weber Spirit II &#8211; E310’s build quality and technology make this grill a clear upgrade from other starter models.</li>
<li>Weber’s advanced GS4 grill system includes an igniter that’s guaranteed to light every time, even heat distribution, grease management to prevent flare-ups and an indicator that shows the level of propane remaining in your tank.</li>
<li>The Spirit II &#8211; E310, like all Webers, is a heavy-duty grill designed to last for decades in most climates.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dyna-Glo-4-Burner-Open-Cart-LP-Gas-Grill-in-Black-DGF493PNP-D/302774519" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dyna-Glo &#8211; DGF493PNP-D</a> four-burner gas grill is only $20 less than the Char-Broil &#8211; Performance, but the difference in build quality and performance was noticeable. The Dyna-Glo is a popular grill sold by Home Depot, but in reading online reviews, it’s clear that people are buying it for a single season and hoping it will last through the winter to maybe get a second summer out of it. That’s a fair assessment; its lightweight and cheaply finished materials would soon rust if the grill was left outside in the rain and snow.</p>
<p>During our testing, we had frequent grease flare-ups, which upon inspection, were caused by the Dyna-Glo’s flame tamers: they’re too narrow and positioned directly under the cooking grate. Consequently grease drips off the cooking food onto the burners rather than the bottom of the firebox. We needed to keep a close watch that the sudden bursts of flame didn’t burn everything we were grilling.</p>
<p>The back of the grill was much hotter than the front, so we continually re-positioned the food to prevent it from overcooking. Overall, grilling on the Dyna-Glo was more hands-on and a less pleasant experience than it was with the Char-Broil and Weber. If you’re looking for an inexpensive grill, we recommend the far superior Char-Broil &#8211; Performance instead.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you’re new to grilling or you’re looking to replace the grill you have, we recommend the <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Char-Broil-Performance-Black-And-Stainless-5-Burner-Liquid-Propane-Gas-Grill-with-1-Side-Burner/1000523547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Char-Broil &#8211; Performance</a> series as the best gas grill for the money. We tested the five-burner, but the Char-Broil Performance is available in other sizes to suit your needs or space requirements.</p>
<p>It’s sturdily made, heats and cooks evenly and makes it easy to grill like a pro,</p>
<p>If you want to upgrade, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077JTCMKQ/?tag=ybdgrill-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weber Spirit II &#8211; E310</a> lives up to the company’s storied reputation. Like all Weber grills — both charcoal and propane gas — the Spirit is heavy-duty and built to last. Its high-end infinity ignition system, evenly distributed heat and grease management are worth the splurge if you grill everyday.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>Backpacks for carrying laptops are everywhere, and there are tens of thousands of designs to pick from. The essential features are pretty obvious: A laptop backpack has to carry your laptop and other daily essentials in a comfortable and secure way, but should also give you easy access when you need your most frequently-used items.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re gear enthusiasts at Your Best Digs, with a team that&#8217;s mostly made up of remote contributors. We all have bags we love, and most of us have owned bags we loathed.</p>
<p>After writing down a list of features that we consider absolutely essential, we started our research by collecting data about what influences the preferences of backpack buyers. We polled the gear nerds in the office and the digital nomads on our remote teams about the qualities they consider essential to a perfect laptop bag.</p>
<p>Access to a laptop and the accessories that come with it were (predictably) top of the list, but the other priorities were split. When we broke down our results into groups of people with different budgets, the preferences were more consistent.</p>
<p><strong>It was pretty clear that the more you spend, the more important the aesthetic of a backpack becomes.</strong> Those willing to spend big bucks on a backpack also prioritized waterproofing.</p>
<p>Of our survey-takers who didn&#8217;t want to spend as much money on a backpack, the biggest priority was functionality. Features like sunglasses pockets and bags that don&#8217;t fall over started filtering to the top in this group.</p>
<p>Our lead researcher for this review has owned a Tom Binh bag for a decade, and he spent some time searching the Tom Binh official forums for opinions about what makes a particular bag best for certain scenarios. (People on the Tom Binh forums like to talk about bags a lot.)</p>
<p>We considered all the recommendations from websites that actually tested for specific qualities, like Outdoor Gear Lab, as well as sites that focused on summarizing the strengths of different bags, like PackHacker, TheBrokeBackpacker and Wirecutter.</p>
<p>We took the priorities from our research and started searching retailers for high-quality backpacks with essential features and good design. We also checked out budget-friendly bags with high review counts and good overall scores from people who had purchased them.</p>
<p>We scoured subreddits like r/bifl, r/onebag and r/digitalnomad for recommendations from people who aren&#8217;t paid to review bags, and we also spent a long time watching YouTube reviews, mostly from the travel-focused &#8220;one bag&#8221; minimalism crowd.</p>
<p>We also spent some time away from computer screens and looked at bags in person at local retailers like REI and Best Buy. We&#8217;re happy we did, because we would have missed all our top picks if we had only looked at Amazon.</p>
<p>After we put together a list of 30 top-rated backpacks that fit our criteria, we had to cull the herd to a short list that really hit our core priorities. <strong>We found six bags with all the essential features plus some key perks that made them stand out.</strong></p>
<p>We decided to test bags that were mostly in the $50–$100 price range. We did test one $130 bag, however, to see if our testers noticed the difference high-end materials can make.</p>
<p>We skipped the really cheap bags we researched after reading too many accounts of bad zippers, bad stitching and uncomfortable straps. If you just want something cheap that will carry a laptop, you can use nearly any backpack and even get decent protection with a padded sleeve.</p>
<h3>What about premium bags?</h3>
<p>We like a lot of bags in the $200-and-up price range that we didn&#8217;t test. From the nine premium bags we researched in-depth, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EH3CM4C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Incase &#8211; Icon</a>, the <a href="https://blackember.com/pages/waterproof-urban-backpacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Ember &#8211; Citadel</a>, the <a href="https://www.tombihn.com/collections/laptop-bags/products/synapse-25?variant=7593508110399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Binh &#8211; Synapse</a> and the <a href="https://www.goruck.com/rucksacks/compare-rucksacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoRuck &#8211; GR1</a> came the closest to making the grade.</p>
<p>When we talked to our friends and coworkers about expensive bags, they all had very different ideas about what they wanted. Some people want a leather briefcase that will make a good impression at business meetings, while others want a pack with adjustable suspension for comfortable all-day trail use.</p>
<p>We decided not to try picking just one or two of these &#8220;ultimate upgrade&#8221; bags to test, but we hope that the testing we did with less expensive bags can help you find out about the features that make a great bag.</p>

[table id=256 /]
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Internal capacity:</b> Typically listed in liters, this is a measurement of how much space a pack has to hold bulky items. A 20-liter backpack is just big enough for a laptop and a few books, 25 liters gives you room to stash a sweater, and a 35-liter bag can usually replace a carry-on suitcase for weekend trips.</p>
<p><b>Fall protection: </b>There are three ways a good backpack can keep your computer safe from falls. First, the laptop pouch can be sewn so that its bottom is higher than the bottom of the bag. Second, the pocket can include foam padding to absorb shock and pressure. Finally, a pouch that holds your laptop tightly means there&#8217;s less room for it to knock around inside when your bag is bumped.</p>
<p><b>Fabric weight:</b> Fabrics are graded by weight in &#8220;deniers,&#8221; and 1000-denier nylon yarn is the extra-rugged stuff woven into the canvas-like materials used for suitcases and outdoor gear. The 500-denier yarn most bag manufacturers use is still resistant to abrasion and rips, but it&#8217;s significantly lighter and more supple. As saving weight becomes even more important, manufacturers are more likely to use thin 200-denier fabric in a &#8220;ripstop&#8221; weave that won&#8217;t fall apart if you get a hole.</p>

<p><b>Fabric type:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Nylon</b> is the gold standard for a tough, light-weight polymer that resists wear, heat and stains. The main downside to nylon is that it absorbs water, which makes it more difficult to dye and can lead to soggy-feeling fabric if you&#8217;re caught in the rain.</li>
<li><b>Polyester</b> is sometimes substituted to allow colors or textures that aren&#8217;t possible with nylon. It&#8217;s not as tough as nylon, but it&#8217;s very slightly more heat resistant and the fabric itself won&#8217;t get soggy.</li>
<li><b>Dyneema, Spectra and Kevlar</b> are extra-tough filaments (like fishing line) that are sometimes woven into the ripstop pattern of lightweight nylon to make it stronger.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Waterproof treatments: </b>Most fabric used in bags is given at least a quick spray with a durable water repellent (&#8220;DWR&#8221;) treatment. This coating will keep water in droplets and help it roll off your bag instead of soaking in. If your bag is sitting in the water or puddles form on the top of the bag, you need a fabric with a heavier waterproof backing and sealed seams to keep your gear dry.</p>
<p><b>Specialized pockets:</b> We looked specifically for bags that had some way to carry a water bottle or travel mug in an easy-to-reach place while you&#8217;re wearing it. Glasses don&#8217;t demand as much specific space, but a convenient pocket that will protect them from scratches is a nice bonus.</p>

<p><b>TSA checkpoint-friendly features:</b> Since 2008, the Transportation Safety Agency has had <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/releases/2008/08/15/checkpoint-friendly-laptop-bag-procedures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a specific set of rules</a> that allows you to keep your laptop inside some kinds of bags while clearing security checkpoints. Bags that meet these guidelines have a fold-out laptop sleeve or pouch that gives an unobstructed view of the laptop to the X-ray machine. The advantage is that you don&#8217;t need to pull your laptop out and put it in a bin, but sometimes these bags are actually less convenient for everyday laptop use.</p>
<p><b>Anti-theft features:</b> The most common and functional security feature we saw is a set of rings on some bags&#8217; zippers that lets you lock them together with a small padlock. Other features like embedded cut-proof steel mesh tend to add a lot of bulk and weight, so we discounted bags that included them.</p>
<p><b>Sternum and waist straps:</b> Even the best shoulder straps can only do so much for keeping a heavy load balanced and in place. A connecting strap across your chest or an extra strap around your waist will keep a backpack from slipping, shifting and flopping, which is especially important if you&#8217;re on a bike or running to catch a bus.</p>
<p><b>Ventilated back panels: </b>All of the backpacks we tested feature some kind of sweat-wicking material or ventilation-friendly sculpting to keep your back cool and comfortable on long, hot days.</p>

<p><strong>We gave our six top bags to four testers, each with their own personal taste and set of needs.</strong> Two of our digital nomads are remote-working editors for Your Best Digs, and they rely on an Ogio backpack and a Tom Binh messenger bag, respectively.</p>
<p>One tester is a regional account manager who carries his laptop in a Timbuk2 backpack to different cities every week, and he gave us some perspective on the suitability of bags for air travel and on-the-road organization.</p>
<p>Our last tester is a biomechanical engineering PhD candidate who carries her laptop all over the University of California Irvine campus every day. She normally uses a North Face &#8211; Recon backpack, and she&#8217;s an avid hiker, so she provided some insight into the way laptop-focused bags compare to trail gear.</p>
<p>Our testers took these bags on planes, trains and motorcycles. We carried laptops ranging from 12-inch ultralights to full-size 15-inch models. We loaded each bag with our everyday complement of things like chargers, headphones, books, water bottles and lunches.</p>
<h3>Fit for different laptop sizes</h3>
[table id=257 /]
<p>While the average laptop is thinner and lighter than anything we could imagine a few decades ago, those of us with big desktop-replacement machines need their bags to be just as supportive and protective as ever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as simple as saying that a bigger backpack will be better for more people, though. Our testers with slim or compact laptops felt much happier when using bags that kept their computers from flopping around.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ESKY9FU/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Swissgear &#8211; 1900</a> has, technically speaking, the biggest laptop pocket. That pocket is really a full-size section of the backpack, though, and it only has a velcro strap to keep a laptop from flopping around. If you keep your laptop in a neoprene sleeve and value the checkpoint-friendly design that might be totally fine, but most of us worried about how much our machines clunked around in the Swissgear bag.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI &#8211; Ruckpack</a> had the opposite problem: While this slim and utilitarian bag will technically hold a 15-inch MacBook Pro, such a wide laptop will push out on the Ruckpack&#8217;s side pockets and make the bag much less usable than it should be.</p>
<h3>Comfort and stability</h3>
<p>After carrying laptops, lunches and other day-to-day loads for four weeks, our lead tester tried wearing each pack with 20 lbs of weight inside for ten minutes at a time while working at his desk and walking around the block. By the time he circled back to his first pack for a second try, it was clear which designs were actually comfortable under a bigger load.</p>
<p>The trail-born pedigree of The North Face &#8211; Mainframe and Mystery Ranch &#8211; Rip Ruck made them easy choices for comfort. The surprise was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play</a> pack, which was still surprisingly comfortable with a full load.</p>
<h3>Waterproofing</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/waterproof.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Our team is fortunate enough to live in a climate without much unexpected rain, so none of our testers had to use these bags in a real downpour.</p>
<p>But we did test for waterproofing anyhow. We put a paper towel into each of the pockets and compartments of the six bags and then thoroughly drenched them with the soaker head from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-garden-hose-nozzle/">garden hose nozzle review</a>. Next, we blew the remaining water off the bags with a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-leaf-blower/">leaf blower</a> to simulate the worst conditions for waterproofing, like cycling in the rain.</p>
<p><strong>All of the bags have some kind of water repellent coating to help shed water.</strong> If you just get caught in a quick downpour while you&#8217;re walking to your car, you probably won&#8217;t have to worry about any of these bags letting water in.</p>
<p>Under a sustained downpour, though, most bags will let you down. Only <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> was able to keep any water from seeping in, undoubtedly because it features a flap that covers the main zipper and backing trim behind the other zips.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129538%2Fmystery-ranch-rip-ruck-sack-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mystery Ranch &#8211; Rip Ruck</a> is a close second in this category, with its beefy water-resistant YKK Aquaguard zipper that has a polyurethane coating to minimize leaks. We still saw some drips seep through under the full blast of our test downpour, but the fabric on the Rip Ruck absorbed less water overall and dried out more quickly than the Mainframe.</p>

<p>Our testers all preferred the look, feel and features of <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a> mid-size laptop backpack. With 24 liters of storage capacity but only one main compartment, this bag strikes a great compromise between carrying enough gear and keeping a sleek, minimalist profile.</p>
<p>The North Face is a top manufacturer of sporting goods, with a devoted following among those who use their gear on the trail and those who just want to look like they do. The Mainframe is based on many of the best features of the big <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LFE73T0/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">30-liter Surge travel pack</a>, cut down to the size of smaller daypacks like the Recon and Jester. The Mainframe has only one main compartment and a clean, no-nonsense set of accessory pockets.</p>

<p>Despite being a bag designed for sale at Best Buy exclusively, The North Face didn&#8217;t cut any corners with the build quality. The Mainframe uses heavy YKK coil zips with cast metal pulls all over. The fabric used is mostly 210-denier ripstop Cordura nylon, with a heavier Oxford-weave polyester-nylon bottom panel to help with long-term wear.</p>
<p><strong>This was easily the most-loved style among our testers, too.</strong> The outside zips, loops and straps are just enough to indicate a serious piece of gear without making you look like you got lost on your way to a campsite. Best Buy only buys this in gray, but the fabric has a nice texture and pattern that goes with basically everything.</p>

The style, comfort and versatility made this a winner with each of our testers.</p><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank"><button>See Price at BestBuy.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The waterproofing on the Mainframe, as mentioned above, is excellent. Water won&#8217;t get in through the flap-covered zippers, even after a thorough soak and a blast of wind. It&#8217;s not a dry bag, though: The Nylon fabric will soak up water if you leave it sitting in the bottom of a kayak. If you do get caught in a downpour, make sure to empty the bag, and let the fabric dry out.</p>
<h3>Not as good for 17-inch laptops</h3>
<p>While the Mainframe is technically just big enough to hold the old 17-inch 2011 MacBook Pro (which is 10.51 inches wide and just under an inch thick), it&#8217;s not going to help you with a massive gaming laptop. For example, the new 17-inch chassis from Clevo (customized and re-packaged by specialty brands like Sager and Falcon Northwest) fills up 11.6 inches in pocket width and more than 1.6 inches in thickness.</p>
<p>The Mainframe doesn&#8217;t make any allowance for thickness in the cut of the pouch; the pocket panel is cut about a half-inch wider than the back panel of the pack so it puffs out, and the stiff padding materials will bend around a laptop to allow a thicker laptop to fit. Even an old 14&#8243; Thinkpad is a tight fit when you slide it in.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good thing on the whole; modern laptops tend to err on the side of slimness. When we were carrying a Surface and a MacBook Air, they practically disappeared in the bigger laptop pockets and moved around a lot when we walked with them, but the Mainframe keeps slim laptops snug.</p>
<p>In addition to the main laptop compartment, the Mainframe also has a padded tablet pocket, at 8 by 11 inches it&#8217;ll hold a mid-size tablet like the 10.5-inch iPad Pro or Surface Go.</p>
<h3>Useful organization for essentials</h3>
<p>The big, vertical zippered pockets on the Mainframe are a great compromise between a second full-size compartment and a smaller set of handy outside pockets. <strong>These pockets are just right for easy access with the bag slung over one shoulder and pulled in front of your chest.</strong></p>
<p>A fleece-lined glasses pocket is great for fragile and scratch-prone items, but it&#8217;s big enough to nestle a full-size pair of folding headphones.</p>
<p>For hydration on the go, the side water-bottle pockets are also basically perfect. They&#8217;re stretchy elastic mesh, so they don&#8217;t look baggy when empty, and they can secure anything from a compact 12-ounce water bottle to a 32-ounce insulated monster like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">our beloved Klean Kanteen</a>. The side compression straps also make these bottle pockets great for lugging a compact tripod.</p>
<p>One thing this bag doesn&#8217;t do well is keep your lunch separated from your books. With only the one main compartment and a slim profile, stuff gets squished together when you start walking with this pack on.</p>
<p>Of all the bags we tested, the Mainframe was the model everyone loved most. It&#8217;s a great backpack for small to mid-size laptops up to 15 inches, and organization features are ideal for keeping accessories handy during a day at work or the library. It can&#8217;t carry enough clothes for a weekend trip, but for bombing around town it won&#8217;t slow you down.</p>

If the Mainframe is still too big for your minimalist setup, the <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18-liter Ruckpack from REI</a> impressed all of our testers with its thoughtful design that gets the maximum possible utility out of a tiny bag.</p>
<p>Let’s get the drawbacks out of the way: The Ruckpack is not very waterproof, and the thin ripstop nylon doesn&#8217;t inspire as much confidence as the heavier fabric on other bags. The zippers on the Ruckpack are also the smallest in this lineup of packs.</p>
<p>If you fill up the laptop pouch completely with a 15-inch laptop (or even a clunky older 14-inch) you&#8217;ll lose most of the functionality of the side organizer pocket and the water bottle pocket. This bag really only shines if you&#8217;re carrying a laptop that’s 13 inches or smaller.</p>
<p>REI sells a 28-liter version of this back that&#8217;s an inch wider and should be better for carrying a full-size laptop, but it&#8217;s not any less expensive than the higher-quality North Face bag.</p>
<p><strong>The real selling point of the Ruckpack is the organization features.</strong> One zippered side pocket can hold pens, a wireless mouse, every day carry tools and pocket-sized notebooks. There&#8217;s even a dedicated glasses pocket tucked inside. Access to essentials couldn&#8217;t get much better than this.</p>

<p>This is a top-loading bag, and it&#8217;s small. If you only need to carry a small laptop and stuff a sweater and a paperback in the main compartment, the design is fantastic. Even loading up headphones, spare chargers and notepads, we were impressed at how well it carries.</p>
<p>If you want to get your laptop in and out of a backpack as quickly as possible, the zip-around shape of this top flap isn&#8217;t ideal. You basically need two hands to open and close this backpack easily.</p>

<p>The shoulder straps on the Ruckpack are fully featured, with an adjustable-height sternum strap and a waist belt you can tuck away or remove altogether. The padding on these straps is good for the amount of gear you could reasonably pack inside.</p>
<p>If you find yourself carrying jugs of water or bags of flour, you&#8217;ll definitely want to use the extra straps to take as much weight off your shoulders as you can.</p>
<p>For a slim and budget-priced bag, we were impressed to find a full-size water-bottle pocket that&#8217;s not just floppy netting. The cinch strap does a good job of adjusting for different bottles, and the cinch strap can make this side pouch a good spot for long and bulky items as well. There are even elastic loops and hidden ladder straps if you want to attach pouches or trekking poles.</p>
<p>The only problems we had with the Ruckpack are excused because of the compact size or the price constraints. For a budget-priced bag carrying a compact laptop, the design sensibility on offer here is top-tier.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> is our pick for the best 17-inch laptop backpack. With ample space for a large laptop, but not so many random pockets that you&#8217;ll lose your wallet and keys, this is a big bag that&#8217;s also smart.</p>
<p>Our testers didn&#8217;t rate this bag highest for any one factor, but when we went back and compared bags for how they looked and how well they helped us carry stuff, a few of us gave Targus major bonus points.</p>
<p>This Targus laptop bag carries well. It&#8217;s a bag that feels smaller than it really is, and that&#8217;s almost always a sign of great bag design. The straps are comfortable, and there&#8217;s a sternum strap to keep it from slipping off your shoulders on a long trek or bike ride.</p>
<p><strong>The perfect application for this bag is for anyone who hits the gym mid-day or on the way to work.</strong> For those people, the shoe compartment, laundry bag and toiletry organizer are excellent features that set this bag apart.</p>
<p>Note that the shoe compartment at the bottom of this bag is vented, which makes it better for the stated application but hurts the water resistance of the bag.</p>
<p>There is a small coat-hanger style hook that peeks out of the top of this backpack and attaches to a strap that runs all the way down to the bottom seam. For accessing toiletries and the laundry bag in a locker room, that&#8217;s a really great feature. In some offices, it might also work, but we can&#8217;t see it being useful in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>One downside to a full-zip main compartment design like this is that you might accidentally open the bag farther than you intend. If you just want to get your laptop out and wind up dropping books on the floor, that&#8217;s annoying.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if this laptop pocket qualifies as TSA-checkpoint friendly. If you have anything in the laundry bag ,and you don&#8217;t separate the velcro-attached shaving kit, it certainly wouldn&#8217;t be. But with the right load-out and an understanding TSA crew, you might be able to keep your laptop in the pouch going through security.</p>

It's not as stylish or rugged as some backpacks, but the features are well-designed.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p><strong>Even if you don&#8217;t use all of the features as they were designed, the pouches and pockets are great for keeping your giant laptop and accessories in order.</strong></p>
<p>Compared to the Swissgear and other full-size backpacks we tested or researched Targus hit a good balance of size and function. Some large bags have too many pockets and pouches, and that makes it hard to remember where you stashed seldom-used accessories.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a giant backpack that will replace your suitcase, but it is a great bag to carry large laptops and bulky items in a sensible way. Many people could probably get away with using this as a weekend carry-on.</p>
<h3>Carrying big laptops</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got a giant laptop, there are two ways to carry it in a backpack. You can find a bag like the Targus with a built-in sleeve or pouch that will cradle your big-boned device and keep it from moving around, or you can forget about trying to find the perfect bag and just throw it in a full-size compartment.</p>
<p>Targus made this bag with a pouch that&#8217;s 11-inches wide and an inch thick when empty, which makes it big enough to hold most modern 17-inch desktop replacements. It&#8217;s far more secure than the giant flip-out compartment SwissGear uses, though some bigger laptops won&#8217;t fit.</p>
<p>The pocket features a flap that completely encloses the laptop, which mostly gets in the way when you want to quickly insert or remove your machine. Most bags just use a simple strap for this kind of extra security. Fortunately, you can tuck the flap inside the pocket and mostly forget it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re carrying a tablet with your giant laptop, there&#8217;s also a padded tablet pocket in the second compartment.</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>The quality of materials on the Targus bag is less impressive overall than on the Swissgear or Dakine packs, but comparable to the REI. The mesh padding on the back is ample, but a few of our testers raised concerns about how it will hold up over time.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of recognizable zipper brand names or over-sized coils, the zippers on this bag were actually some of the smoothest-zipping we found. Dakine gets points for using YKK zippers on a backpack that costs less than $60, but Targus seems to have found a supplier that gives even better bang for the buck.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a 17-inch laptop, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> gives you carrying capacity without forcing you into a giant bag.</li>
<li>Open-flat design is great for travel or even the locker room, not ideal at a coffee shop.</li>
<li>The organizer pockets in this bag are aimed at gym use, but they work for organizing other accessories too.</li>
<li>If you change shoes at the office, definitely check out this bag.</li>
<li>Targus bags are easy to find, but are priced fairly high.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;re tired of stretched-out water bottle pockets and broken zippers, and if you take one look at the latest trendy fake rucksacks and shake your head, <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F129538%2Fmystery-ranch-rip-ruck-sack-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mystery Ranch offers the Rip Ruck</a>.</p>
<p>For laptops up to 15 inches, this backpack includes a great carry pouch with elastic bands at the side to keep the fit snug. It&#8217;ll take thicker models than the Mainframe, since the main restriction here is the width of the pack rather than the size of the pouch. There&#8217;s a tablet pouch integrated into the laptop pouch, and there are also document sorters in the laptop compartment which are great for large books, notepads and magazines.</p>
<p>The laptop compartment in this backpack is nearly perfect. It&#8217;s the rest of the bag that was polarizing.</p>
<h3>Materials and comfort</h3>
<p>This is a bag made from 500-denier Cordura nylon, which is an industry standard for rugged durability. It&#8217;s coated on the inside for good water resistance, and this worked very well to keep this bag from feeling soggy after a good dousing.</p>
<p>Mystery Ranch has built their brand around beefy YKK Aquaguard coil zips in surprisingly versatile configurations, and these are very good at keeping out water without relying on flaps. <strong>This is the fastest bag to get gear in and out of, and it only let in droplets of water in our simulated downpour.</strong></p>
<p>Padding on the shoulder straps of the Mystery Ranch makes the bag cushy above all else. The thick padding has enough contouring and a functional adjustable-height sternum strap. There is no waist belt.</p>
<p>The fit and stability of this pack when it&#8217;s weighed down mostly feels like a half-baked version of the fully-adjustable suspension system that Mystery Ranch uses on bigger bags. That said, if competition for this bag is supposed to be the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G4ZYFXI/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kanken</a> or other classic leather-and-canvas rucksack designs with skinny or un-padded straps, the Rip Ruck is pure joy.</p>
<p>One of our testers was quick to note that he was very disappointed that the so-called &#8220;black&#8221; Cordura nylon was an inky-green and didn&#8217;t match the black straps and zippers. The other styles available make that contrast look less accidental, but this is not a bag for people who are picky about aesthetics.</p>
<h3>Too many zippers</h3>
<p>Mystery Ranch is probably best known for the three-zip design they use on hiking and hunting backpacks, and the Rip Ruck gives you a sample of that utility. The zip on the biggest compartment opens and closes on each side independently, but not up and down for duffel-style packing like other Mystery Ranch bags.</p>
<p>We love the design philosophy of Mystery Ranch, and we love the convenience of opening the one part of a pack you need access to. Most Mystery Ranch bags don&#8217;t offer a quick and easy way to get a laptop out of the suspended pouch, though.</p>
<p>The Rip Ruck is one of the company&#8217;s few designs to separate the main compartment from the laptop pouch (which can also hold a hydration bladder). They&#8217;ve also included two outside pockets, which are a good size for water bottles or other accessories.</p>
<p>The let-down of the Rip Ruck is in all its fasteners. The comment we heard most from testers was &#8220;too many zippers.&#8221; We think it&#8217;s important for a laptop bag to have easily accessible pockets so you don&#8217;t need to dump out your backpack just to find a charging cable or wireless mouse, but the dual-zip-plus-buckle design makes these pockets almost less convenient than an inside pouch.</p>
<p>The dual zippers on the outside pouch pockets help keep a water bottle or travel mug more secure than we expected, but a side-mount elastic water bottle pouch would have been far better.</p>

<h3>Who is this bag for?</h3>
<p>If you need a bag for hiking, Mystery Ranch has some <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F144968%2Fmystery-ranch-scree-32-pack-mens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-suspension designs like the Scree</a> that help you keep your load stable and comfortable while still allowing quick and easy access with the three-way zip. The Rip Ruck is close to that kind of utility, but the straps aren&#8217;t part of an adjustable suspension system. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F146676%2Fmystery-ranch-urban-assault-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Urban Assault</a> is a much better daypack for hiking, but there&#8217;s an extra zipper and a giant flap between you and easy access to your laptop.</p>
<p>If you want a quality, rugged daypack that also has a laptop pocket, this isn&#8217;t even the best of both worlds. It&#8217;s a compromise, and it leans heavily on using buckles for fashion&#8217;s sake to justify itself. There&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t do with this backpack compared to the others we tested, but we expected better organization features.</p>
<p><strong>So, if you want a bag like a classic alpine rucksacks with updated materials, comfy shoulder straps and room for a thick 15-inch laptop, this is a pretty great backpack.</strong> The Rip Ruck is much easier to use than one with a traditional design and leather cinch-straps.</p>
<p>The rest of the materials and construction quality make this a good value if you like the look and attitude. This is one of those buy-it-for-life bags that you can use for decades without seeing any obvious signs of wear.</p>

<p>Dakine is a company with established credibility in the surf-and-skate scene, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SV9PRBO/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dakine &#8211; Campus 33 liter</a> is their entry-level backpack. As the name implies, this is a student-targeted bag, but it has some features that could make it a good value for anyone toting around a laptop.</p>
<p>Dakine uses good materials in this bag, and it&#8217;s offered in a wide array of patterns. For build quality, Dakine uses the good stuff, like real YKK-branded coil zips. They&#8217;re not the smoothest zippers we tested, so the low price is a reflection of cheaper materials.</p>
<p>Waterproofing on this bag is almost non-existent. Your stuff won&#8217;t get soaked in a brief shower, but this bag let in the most water of all we tested.</p>
<p>Note that Dakine makes the Campus line in a variety of fabrics, so if you love the style but want more waterproofing you can get this bag in the &#8220;squall&#8221; color with waterproof Cordura fabric. The big zips are still going to be the primary source of leaks, though.</p>
<p>The waxed nylon bottom panel used for the &#8220;tamarindo&#8221; colorway we tested is a nice touch, with just the right amount of creasing and patina from daily use.</p>
<p>When it comes right down to it, this is a basic backpack with a giant laptop pouch. It&#8217;s definitely the least comfortable backpack if you intend to fill the big main compartment with books or anything else heavy.</p>
<p>If simple and low-cost are what you want, browse the colorways on offer and see if there&#8217;s a style you like. <strong>Our testers were most dissatisfied with the minimal laptop support provided by the gigantic pouch.</strong> It&#8217;s suspended and padded, but smaller laptops just flop around. The most interesting thing about the bag is probably the smallest outside pocket, which is insulated for carrying a small lunch.</p>
<h3>SwissGear &#8211; Scansmart 1900</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22474" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900.jpg" alt="SwissGear - 1900" width="2000" height="1335" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-1000x668@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-768x513.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-885x591.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-810x541.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-1000x668.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-320x214.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-885x591@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swissgear-1900-320x214@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>SwissGear laptop backpacks are some of the best-selling laptop and school bags of all time, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ESKY9FU/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SwissGear &#8211; ScanSmart 1900</a> is one of the most reviewed laptop bags on Amazon. It&#8217;s a giant backpack with some travel-oriented features that might make it good carry-on luggage.</p>
<p>The association between SwissGear and Swiss Army knives is hard-earned, and the brand represents affordable utilitarian bags. The 1900 is really missing a clear purpose behind its design features, though; like a pocket knife with a corkscrew, we&#8217;re not really sure what this is best used for.</p>
<p>The biggest failing of the SwissGear is the laptop compartment. It&#8217;s TSA-approved checkpoint friendly, which means you can unzip the laptop compartment from the rest of the bag and fold it onto the x-ray machine belt without waiting for someone to restock the trays you would need to put your laptop into otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>The Scansmart feature works, but after using these features a few times, our testers agree that it&#8217;s almost quicker to pull the laptop out of a well-designed bag.</strong></p>
<p>The real drawback of Scansmart is that your laptop is mostly bumping around in its giant pouch with only foam padding around the edges to protect it. If your laptop is smaller than a 13-inch model, you&#8217;d probably wind up putting it in an inside compartment.</p>
<p>The SwissGear laptop bag does have a lot of pockets, though. If you&#8217;re diligent about always putting your stuff in the same place so you don&#8217;t lose it, this is a bag that can organize your laptop-toting life.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, the sheer number of pockets is just a liability: This bag will help you lose your keys, your wallet, your passport and your boarding pass on the same layover.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>
<p>After surveying our friends and coworkers, we came to the conclusion that a laptop backpack doesn&#8217;t have to be overly complicated, but it should help keep your laptop secure and your accessories organized.</p>
<p>In testing, the bag that accomplished that task best for laptops up to 15 inches was <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-north-face-mainframe-laptop-backpack-dark-gray-heather-zinc-gray/5968000.p?skuId=5968000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Face &#8211; Mainframe</a>. This bag strikes a balance between elegant and nerdy and offers just enough room to keep track of the stuff most of us need. It&#8217;s not a cheap laptop backpack, but The North Face uses top-grade materials for durability, waterproofing and comfort.</p>
<p>If you only want a slim and affordable bag to carry a small laptop, <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=30c6377c-d617-4f3f-b0df-7be5c85e4c1a&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F118789%2Frei-co-op-ruckpack-18-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI&#8217;s house-brand Ruckpack</a> gets you some of the same great functionality for about 35-percent less money.</p>
<p>If you need to carry a 17-inch behemoth, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H7WPYJ/?tag=ybdlapback-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Targus &#8211; Work + Play Fitness</a> backpack impressed our testers with sensible organization features that help you carry things most backpacks are just not good at carrying, like shoes.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We tested the highest-rated patio umbrellas and stands and determined that Treasure Garden is the best market-style umbrella, Hampton Bay is the best cantilever-style umbrella, and Shademobile is the best umbrella stand.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent weeks opening and closing, cranking and tilting and lounging in the shade of our seven patio umbrella finalists. Ultimately, we determined that the best market-style patio umbrella is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XXNPJJV/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Treasure Garden</a>. We recommend pairing this well-designed, attractive and durable market umbrella with the best umbrella stand, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007TFIRRW/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shademobile’s Rolling Umbrella Base</a>. Alternatively, if you prefer a larger, offset style umbrella, the best cantilever-style umbrella is <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-11-ft-LED-Round-Offset-Patio-Umbrella-in-Chili-Red-YJAF052/206186465" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hampton Bay&#8217;s</a> 11-foot option.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We began our search for the best patio umbrella and umbrella stand by exploring retailer ratings and user reviews online. We also delved into product offerings from major distributors of outdoor patio products like Home Depot, Lowe’s, Costco, Target and Walmart. We then checked out Amazon: Best Rated Umbrellas and The Wirecutter.</p>
<p>Finally, we researched a range of related umbrella shopping guides that included Patio Living: Outdoor Umbrella Buying Guide and Overstock: Patio Umbrella Buying Guide. This narrowed our finalists down to seven patio umbrellas and three umbrella stands.</p>

<h2 id="types">Types of patio umbrellas</h2>
<p>There are two major types of patio umbrellas available: market umbrellas and cantilever umbrellas. Other less common types include sail, wall-mounted and tiki umbrellas. These are all great paired with a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-zero-gravity-chair/">zero gravity chair</a> too.</p>
<h3>Market umbrellas</h3>
<p>A market umbrella, also known as a table umbrella, consists of an umbrella canopy attached to a pole in the center. The canopy is usually round or octagonal and comes in a wide variety of colors, designs, styles and materials.</p>
<p>This type of umbrella is intended to be used with an umbrella stand, which is almost always sold separately. Depending on the style of umbrella stand, market umbrellas can be set up either free-standing or, more commonly, placed through the center hole of an outdoor dining table into a base. If you’d like to use your market umbrella in a free-standing manner, be sure to purchase an appropriately supportive umbrella base.</p>
<p>The vast majority of market umbrellas are ten feet in diameter or smaller, with a standard size of nine feet. For context, a nine-foot umbrella is large enough to shade an outdoor dining set that accommodates six to eight people. One major advantage of this type of umbrella is that, because it is relatively lightweight, it is easy to move around to different locations on your property. It is also easy to put away during bad weather and/or winter months.</p>
<h3>Cantilever umbrellas</h3>
<p>A cantilever umbrella has a swaying canopy that hangs down from a curved or angled pole attached to an offset, heavily weighted base. This style umbrella tends to be larger than nine feet and is used to shade collections of outdoor furniture, pools and hot tubs, hammocks or other areas where you don’t want a pole to obstruct your living space.</p>
<p>This type of umbrella is heavier and more cumbersome to move than a market umbrella. Depending on the size, recommendations for cantilever-umbrella base weights can be over 200 pounds. When you factor in the weight of the actual umbrella, which can add another 50 to 100 pounds, moving around such an umbrella is challenging, even with multiple people helping out.</p>
<h3>Sail umbrellas</h3>
<p>A sail umbrella is a frameless canopy or piece of cloth. It is usually triangular or rectangular and can be attached to adjacent structures using hooks and/or ropes.</p>
<h3>Wall-mounted umbrellas</h3>
<p>Instead of attaching to a base with a vertical pole, like a market or cantilever umbrella, a wall-mounted umbrella comes with a jointed arm that is horizontally mounted to an exterior wall.</p>
<h3>Tiki umbrellas</h3>
<p>A tiki umbrella is similar to a market umbrella but has a thatched canopy. It almost always has a wooden frame and pulley-system opening mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Size and shape:  </b>A nine foot umbrella, for example, is the standard size to shade a table for six to eight people.</p>
<p>While many umbrella canopies are round or octagonal, there are also rectangular and other shapes. A rectangular shape may be appropriate for shading the shallow end of a rectangular swimming pool, whereas a round canopy may better suit a hot-tub.</p>
<p><b>Style: </b>There are two major types: market or cantilever. If you willing to have the pole of a market umbrella in the middle of your shaded space, this is a cheaper option, or cantilever types position the pole completely out of the way.</p>
<p>The canopy size may also factor into which style you should purchase, since cantilever umbrellas tend to be larger.</p>
<p><b>Canopy fabric:</b> Look for ones that are durable, fade-resistant, mold and mildew resistant, easy to clean and that provide strong UV sun protection. Although high-quality, weather-resistant materials may cost substantially more initially, but can ultimately save you money.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Sunbrella: </b><a href="https://www.sunbrella.com/en-us/textiles/shade/residential" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunbrella</a> is considered the gold standard of outdoor fabrics. It is made from soft-to-the-touch, 100-percent eight-ounce solution-dyed acrylic. While many dyeing methods only treat the exterior of the fabric, which fades over time, the Sunbrella technology locks in colors by mixing them into the fabric before it is spun. This creates a more robust, color-safe result.</p>
<p>Sunbrella offers a three-year warranty against fading on their fabrics and the Skin Cancer Foundation has awarded a “Seal of Recommendation” for Sunbrella fabrics’ effectiveness in providing sun (UPF) protection and helping to prevent skin cancer.</p>
<p><b>Oatdura and Spuncrylic:</b> <a href="https://www.sattler-global.com/suntex-site/en/us/casual-furniture-3748.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oatdura</a> and<a href="http://www.spuncrylic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Spuncrylic</a> are very similar to Sunbrella and are also solution-dyed, fade-resistant, high-quality fabrics. They tend to be less expensive than the Sunbrella brand.</p>
<p><b>Olefin: </b>This is another good option made from synthetic polypropylene or polyethylene. Although Olefin is nearly as color-fast as Sunbrella fabrics, it isn’t as soft. It provides good UV protection, is durable and easy to clean and offers a one-year warranty against fading.</p>
<p><b>Polyester: </b>The most common material for canopies. It comes in many colors and patterns and is much kinder on the budget than high-end fabrics. It is also reasonably durable, quick to dry, lightweight and easy to maintain. However, not all polyesters are created equal. Look for thicker material with a higher rating number (i.e. 250-plus grams per square meter) for longer-lasting durability. Polyester will fade more quickly than Sunbrella or Olefin.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Frame materials: </b>The umbrella frame includes the pole and ribs. Look for materials that are weather-resistant and rust-proof. Many umbrellas use aluminum which is lightweight, durable, budget-friendly and can be finished in different coatings and colors.</p>
<p>Treated wood can prevent damage from moisture or insects. However, wood is more likely than other pole materials to snap in extremely windy conditions.</p>
<p>A fiberglass frame is the best option in windy weather, since it is very lightweight and bendable, but it is also more expensive. Some umbrellas mix materials on the frame, such as using aluminum for the pole and fiberglass for the ribs.</p>
<p><b>Opening and tilt mechanisms: </b>There are a variety of mechanisms used to open patio umbrellas.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Basic</strong>: Simply pushing the umbrella open until it clicks into place, similar to a simple rain umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>Easy crank opening</strong>: This requires turning the crank one way to open the umbrella and the other direction to close it. This style is great on larger umbrellas since the canopies are heavy.</p>
<p><b>Pulley opening: </b>Although not as common, some patio umbrellas use a pulley opening system. This is more common on wood-framed varieties.</p>
<p><b>Tilt function: </b>Most patio umbrellas offer this, allowing the umbrella to tilt away from a horizontal angle in order to maximize shade.</p>
<p><b>Push-button tilt: </b>Many market-style umbrellas use a push-button tilt which is located towards the top of the pole, just under the canopy, and can be reached when the umbrella is fully opened. For shorter people, reaching the tilt button can be a challenge. Some models tilt more smoothly than others.</p>
<p><b>Auto-tilt: </b>One deluxe feature that we really like, particularly on large market umbrellas, is an auto-tilt. This works on the same crank mechanism used to open the umbrella. Once the umbrella reaches its maximum open position, you simply continue to crank the handle in the same direction and the umbrella will begin to tilt.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Wind resistance:</b> Many patio umbrellas are equipped with a single wind vent to allow wind to pass through the fabric rather than pick it up like a sail. Some larger, high-end or commercial-grade models offer double wind vents. During extreme wind conditions, we always recommend lowering your umbrella or storing it indoors.</p>
<p><b>Price: </b>Cantilever umbrellas are usually more expensive than market umbrellas, but there are also budget options. Keep in mind that higher prices are often the result of more durable materials, and the umbrella will last longer as a result. Additional features add to the cost of a basic umbrella.</p>
<p><b>Stands: </b>For market umbrellas, umbrella stands are almost always sold separately. Some are designed to support a free-standing umbrella, whereas others require the use of a table to provide additional stability.</p>
<p>Most cantilever umbrellas are sold with a crossbar base that requires weights. In most cases, base weights are purchased separately — although some cantilever umbrellas include both the crossbar and a more substantial base that can be filled with sand or gravel to secure and stabilize the umbrella.</p>
<p>For market umbrellas, one helpful guideline is to multiply the diameter of your umbrella by ten. So, for a nine foot umbrella, you’d need a 90-pound base. If using a table to support your market umbrella, a 50-pound stand may be sufficient under most conditions.</p>
<p>Cantilever umbrellas require significantly more weight than market umbrellas in order to counterbalance the offset style. Recommended base weights can total over 200 pounds, though these are often divided into four parts for manageability.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Set-up</h3>
<p>Our patio-umbrella and umbrella-stand finalists required varying levels of assembly from simple steps like placing the pole into the canopy to much more-complicated instructions involving hardware and small tools. Our assembly tester, who is not particularly handy, was ultimately able to follow all instructions to complete assembly on all products.</p>
<p>The four market umbrellas were very easy to assemble. Two of the three umbrella bases were also fairly simple. The third, Shademobile, involved more steps and was helped along by a power screwdriver. Our assembler required a second pair of hands to assemble the three cantilever umbrellas due to heavy and awkward lifting. The cantilever umbrellas also required significantly more time. All hardware and most tools involved were included and clearly labeled in the boxes.</p>
<h3>Opening mechanism</h3>
<p>Once we had our products assembled, we spent some time repeatedly opening (and closing) our umbrellas. All of our finalists featured a crank-lift opening mechanism. Some of them, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XXNPJJV/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Treasure Garden</a>, <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-9-ft-Steel-Crank-and-Tilt-Patio-Umbrella-in-Cafe-YJAUC-171-CAFE/207205476" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hampton Bay</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZP2REB6/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Abba</a> were easier to operate than others, because the handle turned more smoothly so the umbrella required less physical effort to adjust. We found ABCCANOPY to be particularly difficult to open and close.</p>
<h3>Tilt and rotation mechanisms</h3>
<p>Next, we set about adjusting the positions of our umbrellas by experimenting with tilt and rotation features. Three of our four market-umbrella finalists have a push-button tilt with three positions: upright or tilted to an approximately 30 degree angle on opposite sides of the pole. Beyond that, the poles could rotate in their bases to provide shade to additional areas. We generally found the push-button tilts challenging to maneuver due to both their height and less than smooth operation.</p>
<p>Our fourth market umbrella, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XXNPJJV/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Treasure Garden</a>, offered a deluxe auto-tilt feature that operated on the same crank as the opening mechanism and made it very easy to tilt the umbrella. While it only tilted in one direction, the umbrella pole could be rotated to swivel the tilted canopy into any desired position.</p>
<p>The three cantilever umbrella finalists all used different tilt mechanisms. We preferred the long, sliding handle of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-11-ft-LED-Round-Offset-Patio-Umbrella-in-Chili-Red-YJAF052/206186465" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hampton Bay</a>, which allows the user to choose any tilt position along the pole. We also found the five-position tilt handle of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079FW4BK6/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Abba</a> very smooth to operate. The ABCCANOPY tilt was the trickiest to operate, because it didn’t slide along the pole smoothly due to poor design and construction. On the positive side, it allowed the canopy to rotate a full 360 degrees.</p>
<h3>Stability</h3>
<p>Our stability tests had much more to do with the umbrella stands than the actual umbrellas. We found that all of our market patio umbrellas felt similarly stable when placed in the same umbrella stand. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007TFIRRW/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shademobile</a> was the most stable option. We also liked the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XKM3LGS/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Abba</a> umbrella stand, which can be filled with water and is lower-profile for under-table use. The US Weight base is designed for use with a table-supported umbrella only. We didn’t find it particularly stable even in that situation.</p>
<h3>Durability observations</h3>
<p>All of our finalists endured several weeks of outdoor testing, some light rain and a lot of tree leaves and sap. All products came through in good condition, and they were all easy to clean.</p>
<p>During this time, we took note of any noticeable design or construction flaws that might impact longer-lasting durability. For example, several canopies showed poor sewing technique with abundant unraveling threads throughout the canopy.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XXNPJJV/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Treasure Garden</a> is a nine-foot, market-style umbrella that consists of a canopy attached to a pole in the center. It can be set up either free-standing in an umbrella stand or placed through the center hole of an outdoor dining table and into a base. This beautiful and well-constructed product has several stand-out features — including an easy crank deluxe auto-tilt and durable Sunbrella fabric —  that distinguish it as the best patio umbrella.</p>
<p>First of all, the deluxe auto-tilt feature is a game-changer. Rather than struggling with a hard-to-reach, finicky push-button tilt — as was the case on the other market umbrellas tested — Treasure Garden’s auto-tilt function is built into the same mechanism as the opening crank handle.</p>
<p>Once the umbrella is fully opened, you simply continue turning the opening crank and the canopy will start to tilt. It can tilt anywhere from one to 30 degrees from its original upright position. This auto-tilt feature is especially useful for shorter individuals or anyone who doesn’t want to struggle with difficult to maneuver, push-button tilt mechanisms.</p>

</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XXNPJJV/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Treasure Garden’s entire easy crank system is not only easy to use, it is also extremely durable. The involved cable is made from heat-resistant, braided Kevlar —  the same material used to make military-grade body armor. In other words, you won’t need to worry about the cable snapping on this product.</p>
<p>The other thing we loved about this umbrella is the Sunbrella fabric. As mentioned earlier, Sunbrella is generally considered the gold standard of outdoor fabrics. We can certainly understand why. The octagon-shaped canopy is gorgeous to look at, soft to touch, easy to clean, fade-resistant and significantly longer-lasting than many other outdoor fabrics. Treasure Garden backs the Sunbrella fabric with a full five-year warranty.</p>
<p>While we really liked the Heather Beige color, the fabric is also available in 14 other color options.</p>
<p>Treasure Garden is simple to set up. It comes in a box with two pieces: a rust-free aluminum pole, which quickly locks into place on the canopy. The frame is well-made, extremely stable and has a three-year warranty.</p>
<p>At 17.7 pounds, this umbrella can be easily moved around or put away as desired. It has an attached fabric tie-closure to secure your canopy when not in use. An umbrella stand is required to properly secure this product, but it is not included. We highly recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007TFIRRW/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shademobile</a> stand for this purpose.</p>
<p>The only drawback of Treasure Garden is the cost, which is five times the cost of the other market umbrellas we tested. However, because of its high-quality materials, this patio umbrella is designed to last for years. So instead of buying an inexpensive new umbrella every time your old one fades or breaks, consider investing in Treasure Garden ,and enjoy its deluxe features for years to come.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The easy crank deluxe auto-tilt system makes opening and tilting your umbrella simple and frustration-free.</li>
<li>The Sunbrella canopy fabric is durable, fade-resistant and easy to clean.</li>
<li>This product offers a five-year fabric and three-year frame warranty.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-11-ft-LED-Round-Offset-Patio-Umbrella-in-Chili-Red-YJAF052/206186465" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hampton Bay</a> 11-foot round offset patio umbrella is the clear winner for best cantilever umbrella. This well-designed, oversized umbrella provides ample shade and offers a contemporary look to any modern day patio. The cantilever style is appropriate for shading outdoor lounge-furniture areas, outdoor dining sets, hammocks or even hot tubs and swimming pools.</p>
<p>As with all of our umbrella finalists, Hampton Bay uses a crank mechanism to open and close the canopy. Given the large size of this umbrella, this one works surprisingly smoothly and easily lifts the canopy.</p>
<p>Unlike some of the other umbrellas, this particular crank can be challenging to reach for shorter individuals when the umbrella is fully extended. To work around this potential problem, you can first pull the tilt handle back towards you to lower the height of the crank mechanism and then use the crank to close the umbrella.</p>
<p>This versatile product can be tilted into several positions. A curved upper pole involves the offset canopy hanging from one end with a handle to grip on the other. By pulling on this handle, the canopy can be slid into different tilt positions anywhere along the curved pole. After tilt is adjusted, the canopy can be locked into place by turning an adjacent knob. Although tilting the umbrella is relatively simple, it took us several initial tries to get comfortable with the sliding motion.</p>

<p>The umbrella comes in a large, heavy box (69.1 pounds) that is awkward to maneuver. We needed two people to carry it from the doorstep to an appropriate assembly area. All pieces, including tools and hardware, were clearly labeled and nicely packaged in the box along with detailed assembly instructions.</p>
<p>Although this product required more assembly than the other cantilever umbrellas, most of it was for the included umbrella base. The other cantilever finalists required bases to be purchased and assembled separately.</p>
<p>During assembly, a second pair of hands was helpful, though not required, to hold and snap together various pieces of the base. We also appreciated assistance loading sand (sold separately) into the four velcro-closure vinyl bags located within the base.</p>
<p>Once assembled, Hampton Bay — particularly the base — was bulkier than all of the other umbrellas we tested. Because of this, this umbrella is best placed either in a patio corner or other strategic location so it won’t be in the middle of your outdoor living space. On the plus side, this large base allows for this umbrella to be appropriately weighted with up to 220 pounds of sand or gravel. This heavy base weight provides excellent stability for this large umbrella.</p>
<p>Don’t be tempted to skimp on using the recommended amount of sand. Note that the base is not designed to be weighted with water. If you don’t properly weight this umbrella, it will tip over.</p>
<p>It probably won’t come as a surprise that adding 220 pounds of sand to a 69.1 pound umbrella makes the whole thing extremely difficult to move. To save yourself a lot trouble, we recommend carefully selecting your assembly location to be the same as the permanent location of your umbrella. The good news is that the canopy can swivel 360 degrees for flexibility.</p>
<p>Overall, we found Hampton Bay to be one of the most well-constructed and sturdy umbrellas we tested. Although the rust-resistant base and 2-inch steel pole are extremely stable, the canopy is designed to suspend down from the arched pole and freely sway in the wind. While this works fine in somewhat breezy conditions, we recommend lowering and storing the canopy in higher winds.</p>
<p>Another feature we loved about Hampton Bay is that it includes lighting. Forty solar-powered LED lights illuminate the inside of the canopy frame and create a festive evening ambiance. The solar cell rests mostly out of view on the top of the canopy and a small on/off switch hangs along the edge. Replacement LED lights are included.</p>
<p>We also really liked the gorgeous fabric of the octagon-shaped canopy, made from weather-resistant, 100-percent Olefin. This fade-resistant material has a nice, soft, breathable feel particularly when compared to the standard polyester of many other umbrellas. The cheerful, chili-red color option is a fun shade for all seasons. An additional four colors are also available.</p>
<p>Two attached velcro straps are helpful for storage purposes.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Hampton Bay is our choice for best cantilever umbrella.</li>
<li>Its contemporary design makes an attractive addition to any outdoor lounge area, dining table set, swimming pool or other patio surroundings.</li>
<li>The high-quality canopy is made from 100-percent weather-proof and fade-resistant Olefin.</li>

<p>Although it was somewhat of a hassle to assemble, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007TFIRRW/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shademobile &#8211; Rolling Umbrella Base</a> is our pick for best patio umbrella stand. It is for use with market umbrellas only.</p>
<p>Shademobile has several features that we really appreciate. The first stand-out feature is a set of wheels that allow you to move it around to maximize shade options. Because Shademobile can accommodate up to 125 pounds of sand and bricks to properly stabilize your umbrella, this rolling feature is especially helpful, because it would be very heavy to lift. Two of the four non-marking wheels lock into place for stability or, when unlocked, allow the base to roll or pivot as needed.</p>
<p>Another great feature of Shademobile is that it is supportive enough to hold a free-standing market umbrella. Many umbrella stands are designed for use only with a patio table, but because Shademobile offers a heavier base and supports umbrellas further up the pole, table support is not necessary. You do, however, still have the option to use Shademobile under an outdoor table.</p>

<p>Shademobile is made from high-density polyethylene — a durable, low-maintenance material that will not rust or chip. It comes in three colors: black, bronze or sandstone.</p>
<p>One noticeable drawback is that Shademobile is bulkier than other stands. So, if your sole goal is to use it underneath a patio table, this stand might not be the best option. However, if you would like the flexibility to use it to support a free-standing market umbrella elsewhere on your patio, it’s a great choice.</p>
<p>For the most effective stability, it is recommended to fill Shademobile with both bricks and sand. A combination of the two offers the heaviest weight. It is not designed to be filled with water. Detailed assembly instructions are included.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Shademobile provides a supportive base for free-standing or table-supported market-style umbrellas.</li>
<li>It can be filled with up to 125 pounds of bricks and/or sand for maximum stability.</li>
<li>Attached wheels offer a convenient method to move your umbrella stand around your patio.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Abba &#8211; Market Table Umbrella</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZP2REB6/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Abba</a> — a nine-foot, market table umbrella — is relatively lightweight at 16 pounds, simple to set up, easy to use and a nice addition to shade your patio that won’t break your budget. It is a good option for anyone looking for a less-expensive umbrella than <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XXNPJJV/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Treasure Garden</a>.</p>
<p>As with all of our finalists, Abba has a crank opening that is easy to reach and operate. We noticed that it’s noisier when cranking than others. Abba also offers a push-button tilt mechanism that moves the opened canopy into three different positions: upright or tilted to about a 30-degree angle on two opposite sides. We found that the button sometimes gets stuck, causing the use of the tilt function to be frustrating.</p>
<p>Abba’s round, nine foot canopy is made from recycled polyester, so it’s a good option if you want to be eco-friendly.</p>
<p>The frame is constructed from a 1.5-inch rust-free powder-coated aluminum pole with six steel ribs. The six-ribbed frame is different than the other umbrellas tested, all of which had eight. The fewer number of ribs gives the canopy a nice appearance since more fabric and less metal is visible. We did not feel that the fewer number of ribs noticeably compromised the canopy’s stability.</p>
<p>Although the overall frame is perhaps not as sturdy and well-made as Treasure Garden, it still appears to be stable enough for most situations.</p>
<p>Abba is easy to set up, with good instructions and virtually no assembly. The main step is to screw the umbrella pole into the canopy frame.</p>
<p>Although we did not experience any severe wind during our testing period, Abba is equipped with a single wind vent to allow for breezy conditions. An attached Velcro closure strap is useful when storing the umbrella. As with all the market umbrellas tested, an umbrella base is required and sold separately.</p>
<h3>Hampton Bay &#8211; Steel Crank-and-Tilt Patio Umbrella</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-9-ft-Steel-Crank-and-Tilt-Patio-Umbrella-in-Cafe-YJAUC-171-CAFE/207205476" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hampton Bay</a> is very similar to Abba’s market umbrella and another good budget option for patio shade. Again, there is very little assembly required and, as you might expect from Home Depot’s house brand, the involved instructions are detailed and easy to follow. The main step is to attach the umbrella pole to the canopy section by pushing a small button and sliding them together until they lock in place.</p>
<p>Like Abba, the crank opening is easy to use and reach. The push-button tilt places the umbrella into similar positions. Overall, we found it easier to operate than the Abba tilt.</p>
<p>The round canopy is made from polyester fabric. The sewing quality, however, wasn’t as clean as Treasure Garden or Abba, and there were a lot of loose threads hanging from the canopy. The all-steel frame (pole and ribs) appear sturdy and well-made. However, the dark-brown coating on the steel frame chips easily, so if you are moving your umbrella around frequently, this may be an issue.</p>
<p>The umbrella is lightweight at 13.6 pounds. As with the other market umbrellas, Hampton Bay requires an umbrella stand which is not included. This product offers a one-year limited warranty.</p>
<h3>Sunnyglade &#8211; Patio Umbrella</h3>
<p>As the least-expensive umbrella we tested, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M7WR1E2/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunnyglade</a> is the most budget-friendly option. It is quick and easy to put together, involving a similar push-button assembly to Hampton Bay’s market umbrella. There are no assembly instructions included.</p>
<p>The crank opening is easy to reach and operate. Sunnyglade also has a similar push-button tilt to the same three positions as Abba and Hampton Bay. Like Abba, the button gets stuck and is challenging to use.</p>
<p>Both the frame and fabric are thinner and lighter weight than the other market umbrellas we tested. Overall, Sunnyglade seems comparatively less well-made based on poorer sewing quality and overall construction than the other market umbrellas. Also, it does not come with an umbrella tie for storage purposes. Like the other umbrellas, Sunnyglade features a single wind vent for breezy conditions. The fabric is available in seven different colors.</p>
<h3>Abba &#8211; Patio Cantilever Umbrella</h3>
<p>We liked many things about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079FW4BK6/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Abba &#8211; Patio Cantilever Umbrella</a>. The umbrella is large, attractive and fairly low-profile, especially for an offset-style umbrella. It also has a well-designed, five-position tilt mechanism.</p>
<p>As with all cantilever umbrellas, this product was significantly more difficult to set up than our four market umbrellas. This had a lot to do with its being both awkward and heavy (61.7 pounds). Assembly instructions were included and helpful, though there were a couple steps that we found confusing.</p>
<p>Assembly required two people to carry the box and also to lift the awkward canopy onto the crossbar base, so plan accordingly when setting up this umbrella. We had some trouble aligning a couple of the parts to screw together, but we ultimately succeeded.</p>
<p>The crank opening-mechanism is easy to use, though hard to reach when the umbrella is in its highest, horizontal position. To work around this potential issue, you can first lower the tilt, then more easily reach the crank handle. The feature we really liked on this product is the five-position, push-handle vertical tilt. This convenient mechanism slides very smoothly along the pole and makes it a breeze to change tilt positions. It quickly and securely clicks into position.</p>
<p>We used Abba-brand base weights (purchased separately, not reviewed in this post) to weigh down the crossbars on our umbrella, but a variety of other weight options can be used. Alternatively, the crossbars can be bolted down to a wooden deck. When properly weighted, the umbrella base felt very stable.</p>
<p>Abba’s round, hanging canopy is made from polyester and appeared sturdy and well-made. As with all cantilever umbrellas, it is designed to sway in the breeze, but not recommended for use during high winds. Abba’s frame is constructed from a bronze powder-coated aluminum pole and steel ribs. The non-circular pole is significantly thicker than market umbrella poles, with dimensions of 3.2 inches by 2.1 inches, which makes it more stable.</p>
<p>We noticed that the pole was soldered onto the base slightly crooked, but we were hard-pressed to say whether this made the umbrella appear off-center when fully assembled.</p>
<p>We loved the cocoa color, but Abba also comes in five other attractive options. It includes an attached storage strap with Velcro closure.</p>
<h3>ABCCANOPY &#8211; Cantilever Umbrella</h3>
<p>Although we liked that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NW8ZSFZ/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ABCCANOPY &#8211; Cantilever Umbrella</a> was less expensive than the other two cantilever-umbrella finalists, we found it to be a poorly designed product made from inferior materials.</p>
<p>Initial assembly was straightforward, although product parts did not include a wrench, which was required to tighten four bolts.</p>
<p>The ‘easy’ crank opening-mechanism was disappointing. Despite the fact that this umbrella canopy was smaller than the other two cantilever products tested, it nonetheless required more strength to turn the crank open or closed.</p>
<p>We also didn’t care for ABCCANOPY’s tilt mechanism. This involves a sliding bar with a handle that secures the tilt position. However, the mechanism is made from flimsy plastic, poorly designed and extremely difficult to slide along the pole. At one point, while attempting to adjust, an involved plastic piece snapped.</p>
<p>The canopy can rotate 360 degrees, so there was no need to move the base to reposition as the sun moved. Given that this product recommends 120 pounds of weight to secure the crossbar base, this was beneficial.</p>
<p>There was no Velcro or tie strap to secure the canopy when lowered.</p>
<p>The ABCCANOPY is flimsier and less stable than either Hampton Bay or Abba cantilever umbrellas, but its main advantage is its budget price. If you purchase this umbrella, you may need to put the company’s lifetime warranty to the test.</p>
<h3>Abba &#8211; Round Patio Umbrella Base</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XKM3LGS/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Abba &#8211; Round Patio Umbrella Base</a> is a sturdy umbrella stand to use with either free-standing or table-supported market umbrellas. Although this product is made primarily from recycled plastic, a 14.6-inch attached steel pole offers additional support. It can be filled with water, sand or soil through a convenient opening at the top of the base.</p>
<p>The stand’s diameter is 23.4 inches and has a nice conical shape for under-table use. It can support free-standing market umbrellas as large as 11 feet and comes in black or brown. We liked that this environmentally-friendly product is made from recycled plastic bottles.</p>
<p>Although we preferred the rolling feature of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007TFIRRW/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shademobile</a>, Abba is lower-profile and may be more appropriate for under-table use, particularly under a small table.</p>
<h3>US Weight &#8211; 50-Pound Umbrella Base</h3>
<p>We weren’t huge fans of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041G6V5W/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">US Weight &#8211; 50-Pound Umbrella Base</a> for several reasons. First, it&#8217;s limited for use with table-supported market umbrellas only, although we didn’t find it particularly stable even for this purpose. It can be filled with sand or gravel to about 40 pounds, or there’s a 50-pound pre-filled option available that includes a solid concrete core. Technically, water can be used but is not recommended by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>There is a single screw that is supposed to secured the pole after it is placed into the base; it doesn’t do an effective job. When used with a table for support, a market umbrella is reasonably stable in this stand, but we did not have the opportunity to test this set up in windy conditions. When we attempted to use this stand with a nine-foot free-standing market umbrella, the umbrella was extremely wobbly.</p>
<p>We liked that US Weight is smaller and lower-profile than Shademobile or Abba, with a convenient built-in handle that makes it easy to carry around. It was also the least expensive of the umbrella stands we tested. It can accommodate 1 inch to 1.7 inch umbrella poles. The material appears durable and is advertised to not crack or fade in any weather. The stand comes in five color options: black, sand, white, platinum silver or bronze.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Overall, we found that the best patio umbrella is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XXNPJJV/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Treasure Garden</a>. This nine-foot market-style umbrella is well-designed, attractive and extremely durable. The soft-to-the-touch, fade-resistant and easy-to-clean Sunbrella material, along with this product’s outstanding deluxe auto-tilt feature, combine to create a long-lasting and frustration-free umbrella that will provide ample shade on your patio for years into the future.</p>
<p>We recommend pairing Treasure Garden with the best umbrella stand —  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007TFIRRW/?tag=ybdpat-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shademobile</a>. This product offers excellent stability for either free-standing or table-supported market umbrellas. Because it has the unique feature of being on wheels, Shademobile makes it easy to roll your umbrella around to different areas of your patio in order to maximize your shade options.</p>
<p>Finally, because it accommodates up to 125 pounds of base weight in the form of bricks and/or sand, it can support large umbrellas.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to shade outdoor lounge furniture, a swimming pool, or something other than a basic outdoor dining set, you may want to consider a cantilever umbrella. The best cantilever umbrella we found is <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-11-ft-LED-Round-Offset-Patio-Umbrella-in-Chili-Red-YJAF052/206186465" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hampton Bay</a>’s 11-foot round-offset option. We appreciated the contemporary design, high-quality Olefin fabric and easy-to-use crank and tilt mechanisms.</p>

<p>We began our research by exploring recommendations by medical experts, including podiatrists and physical therapists. First, we learned that the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) recognizes products, including insoles, that are found to be beneficial to foot health with a <a href="https://www.apma.org/Patients/content.cfm?ItemNumber=1108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seal of Acceptance</a>. Five of our six insole finalists have received this endorsement; the sixth received excellent user reviews at an economical price point.</p>
<p>Next, we contacted an experienced podiatrist, Dr. Benjamin Cullen of <a href="https://www.sandiegopodiatrygroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Diego Podiatry Group</a>, for his opinion on the best insole. Dr. Cullen explained that for an average person with mild heel pain, a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN insoles</a> often resolves any issues. He suggests this type both for active exercisers and for people who are on their feet for long periods of time. These insoles, Dr. Cullen says, provide enough support for most individuals without being too rigid.</p>
<p>In general, Dr. Cullen recommends breaking in new shoe insoles first before wearing them for a full day. This involves wearing them for 1-2 hours per day and gradually increasing the time worn over several days. Most manufacturers of the insoles we chose make this same recommendation, particularly if you aren’t used to wearing shoe insoles or orthotics.</p>
<p><strong>Note that while insoles are heavily marketed for a range of different activities (from “running” to “work”), our podiatrist suggests that it is not necessary to have different insoles for each activity.</strong></p>
<p>We also discussed the benefits of using insoles with exercise enthusiast and physical therapist, <a href="https://www.uchealth.org/provider/christine-kittles-pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine Kittles</a>. She explained that putting your feet into proper alignment can relieve pain in your feet and lower body, plus improve overall mobility. Kittles has seen positive results with all types of Superfeet insoles, which mold to the shape of your feet over time.</p>
<p>Finally, we researched previous product testing by The Wirecutter, along with a variety of articles, expert advice and product information online from sources like Runner’s World, Orthotic Shop, REI Expert Advice and The Insole Store.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs an insole?</h2>
<p>Almost everyone who puts stress on their feet can benefit from a pair of quality insoles. This stress may come from high-impact physical activity such as running, fitness walking and intensive training. Or, it can come from long hours of standing on your feet in professions like nursing, food service or retail. If you stand in the same spot all day, consider using an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-anti-fatigue-mat/" rel="noopener">anti-fatigue mat</a> too.</p>
<p>Whether you are currently experiencing foot, ankle, knee, hip or lower back pain, or simply want to avoid it in the future, a good pair of insoles may help. For the majority of people, putting feet into a neutral position — which is what most shoe insoles aim to do — helps solve and prevent related pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>Foot pain can be due to <a href="https://www.apma.org/Patients/FootHealth.cfm?ItemNumber=985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plantar fasciitis</a>, flat feet, high arches, heel pain, <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a20795259/pronation-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overpronation</a> or repetitive stress. If you have a proper insole already and are still experiencing foot pain from repetitive stress, using a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/foot-massagers/">foot massager</a> may help relieve some pain. Shoe insoles provide both cushioning and overall support, thereby relieving pain not only in your feet, but often in other areas of your lower body as well. Shoe insoles can also help prevent blisters and even keep your feet warm.</p>
<p>Choosing a pair to try may seem overwhelming. As previously mentioned, insoles are marketed for many types of activities, such as standing all day, walking, running and hiking. Our experts, however, suggest that there are only two main types of insoles — support insoles and gel/cushioned ones.</p>
<p>Most people can benefit from better support, but some individuals may simply need extra padding. Although our testing focused on full-length support-style insoles (which generally provide the maximum level of support and, ultimately, comfort) the final six selections offer a range of cushioning levels.</p>
<p>Insoles can be used in various types of shoes, including athletic, casual, dress and work. Generally, they are meant to replace (as opposed to go on top of) the original shoe insoles.</p>
<p>Full-length insoles tend to be designed for sturdier, roomier athletic shoes, so there are certain styles of shoes that insoles won’t work for. This can be an issue particularly affecting women’s styles: sandals, high heels and very tight-fitting shoes. In these cases, other types of partial inserts/lifts/pads may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>If your shoes do not have removable insoles to start with, getting a pair of insoles to fit could be challenging.</p>
<p>When it comes to insoles, sometimes the “best” pair depends on the actual shape of your foot, any problems you are having and what activity you are doing.</p>
<p>Women, for example, tend to have issues with forefoot pain from wearing high heels; good arch padding can help divert the pressure from that area. Runners, on the other hand, often experience heel pain, so a deep, stable heel cup could help.</p>
<p>Our feet come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. As you explore the many insoles on the market, it is helpful to understand your foot type. Are you flat-footed or do you have unusually high arches? Take this test to find out. Are your feet wide or narrow? Do you over- or under-pronate? Finally, are you currently experiencing any pain? If you are having severe foot, ankle, knee, hip or back pain, consult your doctor before starting your search.</p>
<p>If chronic health problems, such as diabetes or circulation issues, are contributing factors to your foot, ankle or lower body pain, please consult your medical provider. Custom orthotics and/or additional treatment may be needed.</p>
<p>One important aspect that our testers noticed was that every single pair of insoles tested was a major improvement over the thin, floppy, formless insoles that come standard in shoes. Bottom line? Give shoe insoles a try! Your feet don’t need to hurt.</p>
<h2 id="store">Store-bought insoles vs prescription orthotics</h2>
<p>There are many reasons to try over-the-counter shoe insoles before rushing to the podiatrist for custom orthotics. The biggest reason, of course, is financial. The average cost of prescription orthotics is $400-600. Because this isn’t generally covered by insurance, podiatrists and physical therapists often suggest trying over-the-counter shoe insoles first, since they are generally priced at $10-100.</p>
<p>When making your decision, consider that because custom orthotics are costly, most people only purchase one pair and transfer them between various shoes. This isn’t as convenient as owning multiple pairs for all of your shoes. If store-bought insoles prove effective for you, their more affordable price point may allow you to purchase multiple pairs for this convenience.</p>
<p>Next, note that custom orthotics can also be more of a hassle to obtain, often requiring a referral from a primary care doctor to a podiatrist or orthopedic specialist. This can cause delays in treating foot discomfort. Quality over-the-counter insoles can be conveniently purchased at many stores selling footwear or online from various outlets.</p>
<p>Custom orthotics are customized to your feet, either to correct certain motions or to accommodate specific problems and relieve related pain. They can also be customized to particular shoes, including high heels.</p>
<p>Also, custom orthotics are made from top-quality materials and can last one to five years, depending on a variety of factors. Your podiatrist can help determine when it’s time to replace them. Store-bought insoles tend to wear out faster, though there is a wide range of durability between products. Superfeet, for example, can last up to a full year.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing any active foot pain, Dr. Cullen recommends giving it some time to resolve once you start wearing your new shoe insoles. After the initial break-in period of several days, wear them full-time for an additional two to four weeks. If there’s no improvement in your pain at that point, you may need custom orthotics.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are in doubt as to whether you should try over-the-counter or prescription orthotics, and/or your foot-related pain is severe, please consult your medical provider.</p>

<p><strong>Overall support:</strong> For proper foot health, good support is key. In our testing, we generally found that the more rigid pairs of insoles, particularly in the arch and heel areas, provided the best overall support. Again, a supportive pair of insoles will place the foot in a neutral position, minimizing foot pain and discomfort and/or avoiding future issues with these.</p>
<p><strong>Overall comfort:</strong> Comfort is also very important. The whole point of insoles, after all, is to make your feet happy! Of course, this measure is more subjective than others, since it depends on the needs of your feet, but the majority of our testers found Superfeet the most comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Arch support:</strong> Many individuals seeking insoles mention arch pain as a motivating factor. The arch area should be shaped appropriately for your foot and be strong enough to not collapse under your weight. Those with very flat feet may not find very high arch support as comfortable as those with naturally higher arches, but the exact shape of the arch curve can factor in as well.</p>
<p>Appropriate arch support can help divert pain from other areas, such as the forefoot or heel areas, so it is beneficial for the entire foot. We found that Superfeet offered a nicely shaped, moderate arch curve with strong support that did not collapse under weight. The SOLE, Powerstep, and Physix models had the highest arches; Spenco the most mild.</p>
<p><strong>Heel cup:</strong> The heel is another area of the foot where many people experience pain. Some insoles offer a cradling effect for the heel which can improve stability and comfort. Consider the width and depth of the heel cradle (if any) and how it fits your particular foot. We found that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE</a> offered the most stable heel support.</p>

<p><strong>Cushioning:</strong> The level of padding varies significantly from insole to insole. Some offer a fairly uniform cushion while others focus the padding onto certain areas of the foot. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco</a> insoles were by far the most cushioned of the ones we tested.</p>
<p><strong>Thickness:</strong> Shoe insoles are designed to replace the ones that come standard with a pair of shoes. Shoes with removable insoles are generally higher-volume, with some flexible space to accommodate a slightly larger insole. However, if you need to fit the insoles into a greater variety of shoes, look for a thinner design.</p>
<p><strong>Material:</strong> All of the insoles we tested are made from synthetic materials, primarily foam and plastics. However, there are shoe insoles on the market made from leather and natural materials.</p>
<p><strong>Odor and moisture control:</strong> Although we didn’t notice any particular odor or moisture issues with any of the insoles tested, we can certainly imagine this could become an issue over time. To avoid, remove the insoles entirely from the shoe after heavy use and let them air out overnight. Many insoles can be hand washed, but check care instructions for specifics.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>

    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Running-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We recruited two product testers, one male and one female, to spend some time wearing our six finalists. Both testers either walked or ran a regular route multiple times per week; both also spent a fair amount of time standing in place. Insole tests were conducted after an initial 3-day break-in period, as recommended by our medical experts and manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<h3>Comfort ratings</h3>
<p>The first product test assigned comfort ratings —scale of one (poor) to 10 (excellent) — for each insole after being placed into a pair of athletic shoes. Each model was rated 1) after first putting them on, 2) after an hour of brisk walking and/or running, and 3) after an hour of standing. Care was taken to ensure comparable conditions such as speed, time of day, type of socks and length of route.</p>
<p>These tests were repeated for all of our insole finalists to ensure an accurate and consistent assessment. We then averaged all individual comfort scores to create an overall comfort score for each finalist. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a> insoles received the highest overall comfort ratings.</p>
<h3>Padding inspection</h3>
<p>Next, a visual and touch inspection on padding was completed. This took note of padding levels in the following areas: overall, heel, arch, toe and metatarsal. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco</a> insoles offered the best overall padding and cushioning. SOLE and Powerstep also performed well.</p>
<h3>Shoe fit</h3>
<p>We placed the insoles into a variety of shoes to check fit: experimenting with men’s and women’s hiking shoes, running shoes, fashion sneakers, dress shoes and boots. It quickly became clear which insole was more difficult to put in, take out and move into another shoe.</p>
<p>For anyone wanting to transfer their insoles between shoes regularly, the flexible, floppy style of the Spenco insoles made them the most challenging to maneuver; the SOLE ones were next most challenging due to their slightly larger size, though we found the others fairly comparable.</p>
<p>This stage of testing was also designed to reveal which, if any, insoles slipped around within the shoe. We found that they all stayed in place quite well. We also discovered which ones were more likely to fit in lower-volume shoes.The thinner forefoot area of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GSPH61/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physix</a> made them the lowest profile insoles and most likely to fit into tighter dress shoes and boots or low-volume fashion sneakers.</p>

<p>Heel pain is a big problem for many individuals and a major component of why people turn to insoles in the first place. Therefore, a key point of marketing for shoe insoles involves claims of a “deep heel cup.”</p>
<p>To attach some relative meaning to this claim, we investigated by assigning each insole one of three categories: strong, moderate or mild. Two of the insoles landed in the “strong” category and offered the best cradling of the heel area — the Superfeet and SOLE.</p>
<h4>Arch height</h4>
<p>Insole arches were compared to each other and rated high, moderate or mild. SOLE and Powerstep had the highest arches and strong arch support — but note that the arch curve could be too high for some individuals. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GSPH61/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physix</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058YGR8W/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vionic</a> offered more moderate arch support; Spenco was the lowest.</p>
<h4>Rigidity of insole</h4>
<p>When it comes to insoles, there must be a balance of being rigid enough to offer good support while still flexible enough for the feet to comfortably bend and move. We rated each insole model in one of three categories: flexible, rigid or semi-rigid. Our top choice, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet</a>, and runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE</a>, both landed in the “rigid” category, although note that while the heel and arch areas are fairly rigid, both are still flexible in the forefoot area.</p>
<h3>Customization</h3>
<p>Most shoe insoles are designed to custom-mold to your foot over time. None of the insoles we tested require heat molding, though the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00124J8JW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE</a> model offered the option to heat mold, a simple process involving an oven at low heat before wearing to speed up the customization process.</p>
<p>With either heat or wear molding, our manufacturers’ recommendations consistently suggested breaking in new insoles over a several-day period, slowly increasing the time worn each day. We noticed that the Superfeet insoles showed visible shape changes as they molded to our feet.</p>
<h3>Odor and moisture</h3>
<p>We planned to take note of any unusual odor or moisture after wearing, but all insole models that we tested provided effective odor and moisture control.</p>

<p>After extensive online research to narrow down the field to six finalists, we conducted a variety of product tests that had us running for miles, walking briskly, standing in place and pulling out a variety of shoe styles from our closets. We explored insole support, stability, comfort, cushioning, shoe fit — and even potential issues with bad odors (yikes!). In the end, our feet are extremely grateful and the winner of best insole overall is abundantly clear: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN</a>.</p>
<p>This product comes highly endorsed by medical experts. Along with our runner-up, SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U, this one has received the APMA Seal of Acceptance — a distinction demonstrating that podiatrists agree these insoles add significant value to overall foot health.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Superfeet insoles are recommended by our expert podiatrist, Dr. Cullen, for the vast majority of people with mild foot pain. They are appropriate for high-impact activities, long periods of standing, and general daily wear. Dr. Cullen generally suggests that patients give these a try before spending hundreds of dollars on custom orthotics; however, if active foot pain has not improved within two to four weeks, custom orthotics may be necessary.</p>
<p>Exercise enthusiast and physical therapist Christine Kittles agrees that Superfeet makes the best insoles. She uses them personally and recommends them to help resolve or avoid both foot and lower body pain — thereby improving an individual’s overall mobility. Over time, Superfeet insoles visibly mold to your foot to provide a higher level of customization than many other store-bought insoles.</p>

<p>Superfeet insoles are highly reviewed by a number of product sites that we know and trust, including <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-insoles-for-running-and-walking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wirecutter</a>, <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20790036/a-guide-to-running-shoe-inserts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runner’s World</a>, <a href="https://www.orthoticshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orthotic Shop</a>, <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/insoles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI Expert Advice</a> and <a href="https://www.theinsolestore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Insole Store</a>.</p>
<p>From our series of product tests, Superfeet &#8211; GREEN earned top comfort marks by all product testers, offering a combination of excellent arch and heel support. The arch support offers a moderate, nicely shaped curve that is appropriate for most foot types and a deep cradle provides excellent heel stability. SOLE also offers a nice heel cradle and good arch support, although the arches are a bit higher so they may not be appropriate for all foot shapes.</p>
<p>Superfeet has a fairly rigid structure to the heel and arch areas, similar to our runner-up, along with a flexible, moderately cushioned forefront. While SOLE offers more cushioning in the forefoot area, they are also higher-profile and thicker as a result, leading to more challenges with shoe fit. Superfeet allows for a nice trade-off between comfort and functionality.</p>
<p>The downside mostly comes with cost. Superfeet (and SOLE) are definitely on the pricier end of store-bought insoles. However, we believe that they will last much longer than less expensive options, which we could see visible wear and tear on after just a handful of wearings. Superfeet claims their insoles will last up to one year or 500 miles and they come with a 60-day satisfaction guarantee.</p>

<p>We also really like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SOLE-Softec-Ultra-U-Support-Inserts/dp/B01KT2XVLI/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U insoles</a>. Like Superfeet, they have the APMA Seal of Acceptance and performed well in all areas of our product testing. SOLE can be used for a variety of activities and work best in high-volume shoes.</p>
<p>SOLE performed especially well for overall support. The arch of the SOLE insoles provides high, fairly rigid support, making them a good option for individuals with high arches. Like all models tested, the forefoot area of the insole remains flexible. They have a very similar cradling heel cup to Superfeet &#8211; GREEN, which is part of their appeal and offers excellent heel support and stability.</p>
<p>For individuals with particularly high arches, SOLE is a good option. Even for those with more moderately arched feet, they might be still be comfortable due to the nicely shaped and cushioned arch curve. Alternatively, Superfeet offers more moderately raised arches.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole insole, the cushioning was noticeably thicker on SOLE than all the other finalists, with the exception of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco</a>. This especially stood out in the forefoot area where other insoles tend to run much thinner.</p>
<p>While the padding is certainly nice to have, there is a trade off because it makes the size of the insoles slightly larger than the others, including Superfeet. This makes shoe fit more challenging, although there is still room in high-volume shoes for these to be comfortable.</p>

<p>To speed up the customization process, or make future adjustments, SOLE also gives the option of heat molding — a simple process that can be done in your home oven. If that doesn’t appeal to you, they can also be molded just by wearing them.</p>
<p>The main drawbacks are that they are higher in price and that there may be some shoe fit issues since they are also thicker than some of the others, as a result of more cushioning. We also found that they run a little longer than some of the others, so may require trimming. (Superfeet also required some trimming.)</p>
<p>If you’re looking for good support that also offers good cushioning, and plan to use them in high-volume shoes, SOLE might be a good option. They are extremely comfortable, supportive and padded, earning them best runner-up choice.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078GSPH61/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physix &#8211; Gear Sport Soles</a> offer an ultra-thin design, leaving lots of toe space and also making them a good choice for tighter fitting shoes. The trade-off is that the forefoot cushioning is quite mild. They have a moderately cradling heel cup and moderate/high arch support.</p>
<p>As one of the least expensive options, they are easy on the budget and come with a 100% money-back guarantee if you’re not satisfied. One area of concern is that they do not have the APMA Seal of Acceptance. However, they tested higher than some of the other insoles that do. Like all of our insole finalists, they are generally highly reviewed by previous customers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KVT3AW/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spenco &#8211; Polysorb Cross Trainer</a> is another budget-friendly option that is almost exclusively focused on cushioning and shock absorption, though there is also a soft, moderate arch support that is designed for low- to medium-arched feet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the foam under the metatarsal area already showed some signs of wear and tear after just a couple wearings, so the low price point suggests a trade off with long-term durability, but they also come with a one-year unconditional guarantee.</p>
<p>They are comfortable and cushioned and accepted by the APMA, but may not be right for everyone due to fewer stability features.</p>
<h3>Powerstep &#8211; Pinnacle</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20484" src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles.jpg" alt="Powerstep Pinnacle" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-1000x667@2x.jpg 2000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-610x407.jpg 610w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-768x512.jpg 768w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-885x590.jpg 885w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-810x540.jpg 810w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-295x197.jpg 295w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-360x240.jpg 360w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-375x250.jpg 375w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-414x276.jpg 414w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-320x213.jpg 320w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-610x407@2x.jpg 1220w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-885x590@2x.jpg 1770w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-295x197@2x.jpg 590w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-360x240@2x.jpg 720w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-375x250@2x.jpg 750w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-414x276@2x.jpg 828w, https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blue-powerstep-insoles-320x213@2x.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width:320px) 320px, (max-width:360px) 360px, (max-width:375px) 375px, (max-width:414px) 414px, (max-width:1038px) 650px, 610px" /></p>
<p>Designed by podiatrists, Powerstep offers a full range of insoles, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BVHS1Q/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Powerstep Pinnacle</a> being an “Amazon choice” and APMA-accepted. These have high firm and flexible arch support and a moderate/high cradling heel cup designed for mild to moderate pronation.</p>
<p>The heel is raised slightly higher than some of the other products, taking up somewhat more space in the shoe. The insole’s texture caused some friction for one of our testers on the bottom of the foot and the high heel cup caused heel blistering (due to shoe fit issues) for our other tester.</p>
<p>Powerstep offers a moderate amount of cushioning and is also priced in the middle of the range. Insoles come with a lifetime guarantee against breakage of the plastic foot support.</p>
<h3>Vionic &#8211; Orthaheel Active</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058YGR8W/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vionic &#8211; Orthaheel Active</a> insoles are designed by podiatrists and have a moderately sloped, fairly rigid arch support with mild overall cushioning and a moderately cradling heel cup. There is visible targeted padding in the metatarsal and heel strike areas.</p>
<p>Vionic offers a 30-day guarantee and has the APMA Seal of Acceptance. While there was nothing specific wrong with them, testers just generally didn’t find them as comfortable as the top choices.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>We believe that our top-rated shoe insoles, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033BPBD4/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Superfeet &#8211; GREEN</a>, will help you say goodbye to sore feet. These insoles scored well on all aspects of our product testing including overall comfort, arch and heel support, padding, rigidity, shoe fit and functionality — and were clear favorites among our product testers.</p>
<p>They are appropriate for all levels of activity. The combination of cradling heel support, well-shaped and rigid arches, and overall comfort made them winners for best insole.</p>
<p>Our runner-up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SOLE-Softec-Ultra-U-Support-Inserts/dp/B01KT2XVLI/?tag=ybdsoles-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOLE &#8211; Softec Ultra-U insoles</a>, is another great option for sore feet. This option is especially good for anyone looking for high, rigid arch support, along with good padding, for high-volume, athletic-style shoes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e spent a month using the best insulated tumblers side by side with water bottles and travel mugs. We found that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTIC &#8211; 30 Ounce Tumbler</a> gives you all the same insulation performance and better leak-proofing at less than half the price of the best-known <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Rambler</a>. If you&#8217;re willing to pay, YETI does give you a slide-open spout that&#8217;s less annoying, though you run the risk of dribbles and drips.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are over 20,000 listings on Amazon for &#8220;insulated tumbler.&#8221; YETI is the undisputed brand king, with a tumbler that&#8217;s now even more popular than their ultra-rugged (and expensive) coolers. As with all things that are mass-produced and insanely popular, the number of competitors (and imitations) has expanded just as quickly as YETI&#8217;s profit numbers.</p>
<p>We read and watched dozens of YETI tumbler reviews and comparisons to narrow the mile-long list down to four of the best insulated tumbler cups. <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-tumbler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wirecutter</a>, as always, provides some in-depth testing, and <a href="https://www.savingfreak.com/best-tumbler-yeti-vs-rtic-vs-orca-vs-ozark-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saving Freak</a> compares the costs and benefits of the various copycat brands. GearJunkie, like most sites, only <a href="https://gearjunkie.com/yeti-rambler-tumbler-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passes a verdict on the YETI</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY5Kryq62SQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What&#8217;s Inside</a> tried to do a controlled test, but wound up destroying one of their samples.</p>
<p>In our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mug review</a>, we&#8217;ve seen Klean Kanteen and Hydro Flask go head-to-head competing for a position in our tests. <b>For the first time, Hydro Flask offers something substantially different from Klean Kanteen: a bigger cup that actually matches what everyone else is offering.</b></p>
<p>Between the various well-known brands that are just barely different from YETI, RTIC is budget-friendly and offers a flip-cap lid that at least compares in functionality to the Mag-Slide on the new YETI lids.</p>
<p>CamelBak has an interesting contender in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LA4PUMc/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KickBak</a>, and it fared well in Wirecutter&#8217;s insulation test, but customer reviews of the lid are scathing so we skipped it.</p>
<p><b>We decided to test only the 30-ounce tumblers in this review, since they&#8217;re the most popular and represent a type of drink carrier that&#8217;s really different from a </b><a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener"><b>16-ounce travel mug</b></a><b>.</b> It also allowed us to compare them directly to our favorite 30-ounce insulated <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/" rel="noopener">water bottle</a> to see what difference that narrower opening makes. We selected representatives from a range of prices to see if insulation quality really changes when you buy a $40 tumbler instead of a $16 tumbler.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-get">Should you get a tumbler, water bottle or travel mug?</h2>
<p>Like <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/#best-insulated-water-bottle" rel="noopener">insulated water bottles</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/" rel="noopener">travel mugs</a>, an insulated tumbler will keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. The vacuum insulation also stops that slippery condensation from forming on the sides and leaving a puddle on your furniture.</p>
<p>The choice between a travel mug and an insulated tumbler is a tricky one. In most ways, these products serve an identical purpose for most people: They maintain temperature, and they&#8217;re convenient to sip from (no screw-top like an insulated water bottle).</p>
<p>The big difference with a tumbler is the lid. <b>While a travel mug is still designed for easy-access sipping, many tumblers don&#8217;t have any kind of stopper at all to slow down your sipping pleasure.</b> The lids are simple and easy to clean, but they offer far less insulation than good travel mugs. The best travel mugs keep your coffee hotter and your laptop (not to mention pants) safer from spills.</p>
<p>A tumbler is also available in much larger sizes than popular travel mugs. You can buy a thermos or a giant insulated water bottle, of course, but those aren&#8217;t easy to sip from.</p>
<p>So, the ideal setting for an insulated tumbler is on a hot afternoon where you want to keep your drink insulated, but you&#8217;re more worried about convenience more than spills. Drinking something cold poolside on a scorching-hot day is a perfect example. Reading on the patio in the early morning with a cup of coffee is also a case where the tumbler works better than an ordinary cup.</p>

<b>Size:</b> The most popular tumblers hold around 30 ounces, and among the friends and coworkers who use them daily, that was unanimously the preferred size for sipping cold beverages or ice water.</p>
<p><b>Spout stoppers:</b> Flip-up stoppers and slide-over stoppers are the two common approaches to keeping a tumbler closed. Look closely at what you&#8217;re buying, though: Many tumblers are made with a few different lid styles if you look for them.</p>
<p><b>Base diameter:</b> Do you need to keep your tumbler in a car cup holder? Check the size just to be sure, but most cup holders are designed to hold extra-large restaurant-size paper cups, which these tumblers mimic.</p>
<p><b>Painted, coated or brushed finish:</b> Color coordination is a nice benefit of painted or powder-coated tumblers, but they&#8217;ll show signs of wear eventually. Brushed stainless steel looks great even if it gets scratched, and there&#8217;s nothing that will peel off after a few years.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Everyday use tests</h3>
<p>Our tester used these tumblers in place of his usual water bottle and coffee mug for two weeks. At work, around the house, in the car and at the park, they all kept beverages handy. The 30-ounce size was bigger than our testers preferred for a morning cup of coffee, but for keeping hydrated (or keeping a rum and coke chilled) it&#8217;s just about perfect.</p>
<p>The differences between the mugs seemed smaller and smaller as we got used to them. The flip-lid from RTIC doesn&#8217;t flop around as much as most travel mug lids in this style, which was our biggest concern. The slide closures on the YETI and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> were easy to use, though not any more so than the flip lid.</p>
<h3>Cleaning test</h3>
<p>Cleaning these tumblers and lids was easy, even by hand. Compared to popular travel mugs like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HZI5XNO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contigo &#8211; West Loop</a> with its springs and levers on the inside of the lid, a tumbler lid is dead simple to clean.</p>
<p>What about the dishwasher, though? <a href="https://www.rticcoolers.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTIC</a> and <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/caring-for-your-hydro-flask/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask</a> say that you should hand-wash only, while <a href="https://www.yeti.com/en_US/are-yeti-tumblers-dishwasher-safe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YETI</a> specifically claims their tumblers will survive dishwashing. (Pelican doesn&#8217;t comment either way.) Given the number of outright contradictions we&#8217;ve seen over our years researching vacuum-insulated products, we&#8217;re not surprised by either answer. Extra-hot drying cycles will make the metal expand and contract, so there&#8217;s some risk to every mug, but the biggest problems are usually with color coatings and glued-on plastic pieces.</p>
<p>If you want to keep your insulated tumbler looking and working its best, hand-washing is the safe way to go. But it seems clear that one trip through the washer won&#8217;t destroy the insulation if you find a week-old smoothie in the back of your truck.</p>
<h3>Insulation test</h3>
<p>We took our four tumblers and our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">top-performing insulated water bottle</a> and filled them all with 28 ounces of hot water. Temperature ranged from 190 to 194 degrees Fahrenheit, which is on the upper end of coffee temperature after brewing.</p>
<p>We then checked on the heat loss for the next six hours, and again at 12 hours. The chart below models the results for easy comparison. (The raw data had a difference of four degrees Fahrenheit in starting temperature. The chart shows an adjusted starting temperature, but the temperature change from one sample to the next is as recorded.)</p>
<div id="visualizer-18187-2101266533" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-18187"></div>
<p>The differences between these tumblers is so small that it would be impossible to tell them apart. The real difference is between the tumblers and the water bottle: because the vacuum-sandwich stainless steel walls provide the most effective insulation, the wide lid of a tumbler is a real liability. Even the fact that the Hydro Flask tumbler has no seal to keep steam in made only a tiny difference in the test.</p>
<p>We also added the results from an old test of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VFHKUS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thermos &#8211; Sipp 16-ounce travel mug</a> to this chart for comparison. <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-travel-mug/#how-we-tested" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The testing conditions were different</a> (starting temperature was lower, and we didn&#8217;t test for as long), but we&#8217;ve normalized the starting point on this graph so the sample intervals line up. It&#8217;s clear that even a small narrow-neck bottle keeps heat better than the tumblers.</p>
<h3>Ice test</h3>
<p>In our research, we saw so many variations of the ice test, we were a little surprised that there wasn&#8217;t some kind of consensus. Instead, it seemed that every test had a slightly different result. The real problem with an ice test is getting around the margin of error: It&#8217;s hard to know if you&#8217;re measuring the temperature of the water or the ice cubes. (Infrared thermometers are also often used, and those <a href="https://blog.thermoworks.com/thermometer/how-to-use-an-infrared-thermometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only read the surface temperature</a> of the water, not the temperature of the whole bath.) It&#8217;s also tricky to ensure that all your ice is the same temperature going in.</p>
<p>We ultimately decided not to repeat an ice test because the insulation performance is so clearly demonstrated by a hot-water test. If heat coming into the cup is any different than heat escaping, the amount of time it takes for that difference to show is measured in hours. If you really want the best insulation possible to keep ice frozen all day long (or if you want to keep small amounts of liquid nitrogen, or something similar), a sealed narrow-neck bottle is still your best bet.</p>
<h3>Leak test</h3>
<p>In our travel mug tests, we went as far as putting the mugs into a spin dryer to see if they would leak in the most extreme circumstances. By comparison, most tumblers will spill some of your drink when you tip them sideways. We filled each tumbler with water and turned them upside down to see if any of the stoppers actually prevent leaks.</p>

Don't put this in a bag with a laptop, but if you knock it over it's not going to dump your drink.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The RTIC&#8217;s lid is surprisingly secure, given the competition. You can usually hold this cup upside down, or even leave it sitting on a table upside down, and not see more than a few drops. As soon as you shake it or drop it on the floor, though, all bets are off. (The more fluid you have inside, the more explosive the spill will be when the flip-cap pops open.)</p>
<p>Of the two brands that are trying sliders, YETI is fairly successful, while Pelican&#8217;s lid is a hot mess. It&#8217;s not clear exactly what the issue is, since the basics of the mechanism seem the same, but the Pelican lid always dribbled a stream of water when we turned it upside down. The YETI &#8220;Mag Slider&#8221; lid isn&#8217;t as magical as it sounds, but it works fairly well to stop anything more than occasional drips.</p>
<p>Hydro Flask gives you nothing to work with for spill prevention. If you really want the color options and tapered form factor they&#8217;re offering, they do have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a straw lid option</a> that might be better at stemming the flow of sticky drinks in case of an accident.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is the best bargain in this lineup, and it&#8217;s our top pick overall. The stopper actually prevents some spills, and compatible accessories are easy to find. This is an updated version of the RTIC, but the old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RTIC-30-oz-Tumbler-Pink/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">all-metal-no-stopper version</a> is still available.</p>
<p>Without buying and trying out these tumblers, it&#8217;s easy to make assumptions about performance. &#8220;Maybe the steel is thinner,&#8221; you think. &#8220;Maybe the vacuum is actually less of a vacuum.&#8221; Our testing shows, though, that If there&#8217;s anything fancy that other brands are doing to improve theoretical insulation performance, the giant plastic lid is an equalizer that levels the playing field.</p>
<p>In every case we&#8217;ve seen (even among top-class insulating mugs and bottles from Zojirushi, Thermos and Hydro Flask) a big lid means mediocre insulation. Improving the insulation of a tumbler without making the lid area smaller is like adding better insulation to your house while the doorways and windows are sealed with plastic sheets.</p>

<p>So, what is the difference that brings the price down? The plastic &#8220;foot&#8221; on this new RTIC is less tough than the YETI if you drop it on a hard surface, but the difference in price more than makes up for that.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important consideration when it comes to recommending a bargain-priced tumbler is availability: <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-30-Ounce-Double-Wall-Vacuum-Sealed-Tumbler/171452737" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ozark Trail</a>, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/zak-designs-174-30oz-stainless-steel-tumbler/-/A-52542332" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zak! Designs</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Tumbler-Insulated-Greens/dp/B01AZB6TQW/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BEAST</a> and a dozen other companies are also producing similar tumblers at low price points, but inventory (and new brands) come and go seasonally. RTIC has been around since the beginning of the fake-YETI game, and availability online is always good. That popularity also means that accessories (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0779M1CBK/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this handle</a>) will actually be designed to fit this cup.</p>
<p>The main feature that bumped this tumbler to the top of our lineup is the spill-proof lid. If you don&#8217;t want the flip-cap to stick up into your face when you&#8217;re drinking, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019D9HESO/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">older version of the RTIC</a> with no stopper is going to be just as good at insulating your drink. Note that the outer dimensions are slightly different; old-style handles don&#8217;t fit new-style mugs with the plastic foot.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The RTIC &#8211; 30-Ounce Insulated Tumbler is a bargain-priced drink vessel that will keep your beverage just as cold (or hot) as other brands.</li>
<li>This flip-up lid stopper is the only option we found that really prevents leaks, though it&#8217;s still not safe to put in a bag.</li>
<li>RTIC compromises on quality very slightly, with some plastic parts, but the vacuum insulation is all that it needs to be.</li>

If you want something better than a budget-priced tumbler, there&#8217;s no way to beat the original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; Rambler</a>. YETI didn&#8217;t technically invent this category of drinkware (similar insulated travel mugs have been around for a very long time), but they created a new market with big 30-ounce tumblers targeted at outdoor enthusiasts who loved their coolers for camping and tailgating.</p>
<p>This is not a Yeti thermos: You can easily beat this kind of insulation with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07996C56J/?tag=ybdbtl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">narrow-neck bottle from Klean Kanteen</a>, for about the same price. If you want the easy-filling and easy-sipping convenience of a tumbler, YETI has the same performance drawbacks as the other brands.</p>

The magnetic slider is more convenient than a flip-up stopper, but it doesn't make this cup leakproof. The main reason to pick this tumbler is if you've gotta have that logo.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The one category YETI manages to squeak ahead of some competition is in spill prevention. The Rambler&#8217;s slide cover actually stops most (but not all) leakage and only lets drops escape. In comparison, the Pelican will dribble out a stream. The RTIC is more leak-proof, but the YETI really is ready for those times when your friend fires up the motor on the jet boat and you haven&#8217;t finished your drink.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a YETI for coffee that&#8217;s a little different than the classic 30-Ounce Rambler, there&#8217;s also the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BM72ZXT/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">YETI &#8211; 14-Ounce Rambler Mug</a> for about $10 less. The small amount of coffee it holds compared to the large lid surface means it&#8217;s only going to keep your coffee hot for about 45 minutes, but compared to six minutes for an open-top ceramic mug for some people this is exactly what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>The other case where this is an obvious pick is if you&#8217;re buying a gift. Nothing says &#8220;I only sorta love you&#8221; like a knock-off version of a trendy product. If you know someone who actually wants a YETI, the price difference is worth it.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The YETI &#8211; Rambler is the product that got everyone buzzing about giant insulated cups, and they&#8217;re still the most recognizable.</li>
<li>The price of this tumbler is high, and it doesn&#8217;t keep your drink any hotter or colder than others.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll get drips if you hold the YETI upside down or drop it on the floor, but this lid is good at keeping your drink inside.</li>
</ul>

In many ways, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0769CQYVS/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican &#8211; Traveler</a> hits the optimal price to performance ratio in this lineup, but that doesn&#8217;t make it the best buy.</p>
<p>Pelican is a company that makes quality flight cases for sensitive equipment, and in many ways they&#8217;re like YETI: a small company who established a niche with a specific product, then started building a brand around it. This tumbler is a bit different than the rest, and if you love the screw-on lid with the bigger spout area it&#8217;s a good buy.</p>
<p>The slide-cover lid isn&#8217;t as good at sealing against leaks as YETI&#8217;s lid, though. It dribbles a small stream if you hold the cup upside down. If you really want to keep your drink in, the flip-up lid on the RTIC (or the old-style <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071KW6MRN/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pelican Snap Lid</a>, which you can still buy in 2018) is a better choice.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079445ZGP/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydro Flask &#8211; 32 Ounce Insulated Tumbler</a> is a notable contender from one of the big names in the world of insulated drinkware. Many publications give it a win for the sleek profile and brand reputation.</p>
<p>About the only feature that really stands out, though, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07943NMYX/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the straw lid</a>. If you want your insulated tumbler to look like a Big Gulp, this is the way to go. It&#8217;s a hefty price tag, though: The straw lid was a $13 accessory for a $40 tumbler when we checked. The basic lid that comes with the tumbler is claimed to be designed for good insulation, but without even a stopper to keep heat from circulating in and out it doesn&#8217;t make any difference.</p>
<p>If you or the person you&#8217;re buying for already have a Hydro Flask water bottle, buying a matching tumbler for use around the house is a nice touch. They&#8217;re good looking tumblers, but they don&#8217;t perform any better than the other brands to justify the huge price difference.</p>

If you primarily want an insulated cup to drink coffee from, we think a sealed and better-insulated travel mug is a smarter pick than a tumbler. If you want to carry water around with you, likewise, water bottles are better at making water portable while keeping it colder (or hotter.)</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re just looking for the functionality of the classic SOLO party cup with the benefit of better insulation, the double-wall stainless steel vacuum-insulated tumbler checks all the right boxes.</p>
<p>The brand everyone knows is YETI, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07572PCPG/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our best buy pick from RTIC</a> beats that cup in two ways: first, RTIC is selling their cup at less than half the price with no loss in performance. Second, the RTIC has a flip-up spout stopper that actually keeps your drink inside, even if you turn it upside down and shake it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like the flip-up lid or if you don&#8217;t like supporting imitation products, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJSYMM/?tag=ybd-intum-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the YETI &#8211; Rambler</a> has an updated lid that&#8217;s pretty good at keeping drinks inside without sticking a flap in your nose.</p>
