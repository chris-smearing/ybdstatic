								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e tested some highly rated automatic tea makers and iced tea makers and selected the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQTZ6P3/?tag=ybdtea-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Breville &#8211; BTM500</a> as the best automatic tea maker for hot tea and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00921MFKG/?tag=ybdtea-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Takeya &#8211; 11171</a> as the best iced tea maker.</p>
<p>We’ve used an <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-electric-kettle/">electric tea kettle</a> for years, but an automatic tea maker eliminates the fussiness from the tea-making process, especially if you brew loose tea leaves. The tea infuser is integrated into the kettle, so you simply push a couple of buttons, and in under 10 minutes, you have a perfectly steeped and piping hot cup of tea.</p>
<p>An iced tea maker funnels the hot tea into a pitcher of ice, and again, in a few minutes, you have a pitcher of iced tea to cool you off on a hot summer day.</p>
<h2>Important features to consider</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to buy an automatic tea maker for hot tea, the best ones have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmed settings for your favorite type of tea, including brew temperature and time, and steep temperature steep time</li>
<li>A separate timer for alerting you when the water has reached optimal temperature for adding the tea and a second alert when the tea has finished steeping</li>
<li>Stainless steel trim can help match other kitchen appliances</li>
<li>A borosilicate glass pitcher, which can withstand extreme changes in temperature</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e squeezed thirty pounds of oranges, lemons and limes to find the best citrus juicer, and we chose <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185NWN62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urban Trend &#8211; Tango</a> as the best manual citrus juicer. Its ergonomic design and two interchangeable reamer cones make this hand-held juicer ideal for a quick glass of fresh OJ as you’re running out the door. We also like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011KGTVIY/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dash &#8211; JB065AQ </a>as the best electric citrus juicer for its seven pulp modes, ease of cleanup and great price.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected citrus juicers to test</h2>
<p>If you’re dedicated to the juicing life, then you may already own a high-end juice extractor or blender like Vitamix, which we reviewed in our article about the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-blender/">best blenders</a>. You could easily spend hundreds of dollars on a high-end model, but for this review, we focused on the small citrus juicers — manual and electric — in the $10-$25 price range.</p>
<p>After reading consumer reviews, we narrowed our search down from dozens of almost identical juicers to juicers with a unique feature, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185NWN62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urban Trend’s interchangeable reamer cones</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073PVYM62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bnunwish’s twist-and-squeeze lid</a> or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C22MYGM/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunhanny</a> that can also separate an egg. Sometimes, simple is best, so we also chose to test the type of metallic handheld juicer, like the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O525UL8/?tag=ybdjuice-20">IMUSA</a>, that you see used in every bar and restaurant,</p>
<p>There are several inexpensive electric juicers available, and we wanted to see if they were actually more convenient and user-friendly than the manual juicers. The primary advantage to using an electric citrus juicer is that you’re able to adjust how much (or little) pulp will be processed into the juice. The three electric juicers we tested had different modes for pulp adjustment, but only our top pick, Urban Trend, was effective.</p>

<p>We tested the manual citrus juicers by squeezing Navel oranges, limes and lemons and measured how much juice was extracted. On average, the Navel oranges produced ¼ cup of juice, limes produced two tablespoons and lemons produced three tablespoons.</p>
<p>Factors we considered were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was squeezing juice effortless, or did the juicer need a lot of hand strength?</li>
<li>Did fruit pips and pulp get lodged in the juicer’s filter?</li>
<li>Was the juicer easy and quick to clean?</li>
</ul>
<p>For the electric juicers, we doubled the amount of fruits squeezed with the manual juicers, since their receptacles were designed to hold 25–32 ounces of juice. The electric juicers produced the same amount of juice per fruit, but two of the juicers’ filters were clogged by pulp and pips after juicing a single orange.</p>
<p>We also considered whether the pulp-adjustment feature worked, how easy the juicers were to clean and if it was indeed more convenient to use an electric juicer over a manual juicer.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011KGTVIY/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dash &#8211; JB065AQ</a> beat the other two electric citrus juicers because it had, by far, the easiest pulp adjustment: a small lever on the container’s handle with seven choices for filtering pulp that can be adjusted any time while juicing.</p>
<p>The Dash has two reamer cones that nest and lock into place on top of the 25-ounce container. Halved fruit is placed on top of the reamer, and by pressing down, the juicer automatically starts; releasing pressure, it automatically stops. The Dash isn’t the quietest of the juicers we tested, but it won’t wake up sleeping housemates on Saturday morning either.</p>
<p>Like most electric juicers of this type, you can whiz through a bag of oranges in a couple of minutes. However, what we liked most about the Dash was that the pulp didn’t clog up the filter. Although the Black+Decker and the Cuisinart have larger capacity, it didn’t really matter, because we were continually stopping to unclog the filter, so it took longer to juice oranges. (This wasn’t an issue with lemons and limes, which have little pulp.)</p>

<p>The smaller reamer cone was better shaped for lemons than for limes, but by simply moving the halved lime around the reamer — rather than holding it in place — all of its juice was extracted.</p>
<p>It comes with a lid so you can store squeezed juice in the refrigerator. Although the manufacturer claims the Dash can be machine washed, it’s made of plastic, and high-heat drying in a dishwasher will most likely damage it.</p>
<p>This isn’t a heavy-duty or sophisticated juicer, but its compact size and affordable price make it a good choice for a small kitchen, dorm room or camper.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to operate and easy to clean, the Dash &#8211; JB065AQ also effectively squeezes juice down to the skin in seconds.</li>
<li>It has an excellent pulp-adjustment control that can be changed any time during juicing.</li>
<li>The Dash’s reamer cones nest and snap into the juice receptacle for compact storage.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185NWN62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urban Trend &#8211; Tango</a>’s ergonomic design gave this finalist the edge over the other two manual citrus juicers we tested. It has two interchangeable reamers: one for oranges and grapefruit and another for lemons and limes. Each fits snugly into a ladle-shaped container that can hold 8 ounces (1 cup) of juice. The container has a non-slip base that stabilizes the juicer on a countertop or table.</p>
<p>Each head has a handle that snaps into the container’s handle, and the two halves form a handle that fits into the palm of your hand. As with all manual juicers, the halved fruit is twisted on top of the reamer, and pulp and seeds are trapped in the reamer’s filter while juice is strained into the container.</p>
<p>The Tango’s orange/grapefruit reamer was particularly effective in getting down to the orange’s skin and juicing every bit of fruit. The lemon/lime reamer was great with lemons, since its pointed shape fit perfectly into the halved fruit. Halved limes are more rounded, so we had to move the fruit around the reamer, but this took only seconds, and the reamer extracted two tablespoons of juice, which is the usual amount of juice that can be squeezed from a lime.</p>

<p>The Tango’s filters are narrow enough on both reamers that seeds don’t get stuck in between, and with a quick rinse, the juicer is clean. The orange reamer nests on top of the lime reamer, so the entire juicer can fit into any drawer.</p>
<p>The Tango is perfect for juice on the go. If you want a glass of fresh OJ before rushing off to work, this juicer will get it done with little effort in under a minute.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Urban Trend &#8211; Tango has two interchangeable reamers that squeeze out every drop of juice from fruit.</li>
<li>Its container has a non-skid base so the juicer won’t move on a countertop or table when you’re squeezing the fruit.</li>
<li>The reamers nest into the container, so the Tango can be stored in any kitchen drawer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bnunwish &#8211; AABK03</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073PVYM62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bnunwish &#8211; AABK03</a> manual juicer is a tall 16-ounce cup with a reamer-cone insert that has a webbed filter for catching pulp. The halved fruit is placed on top of the reamer, and the juicer’s lid goes on top of the fruit. You rotate the lid, pressing down, and when it connects with the cup, the fruit has been completely squeezed of juice. The Bnunwish actually extracted quite a lot of juice from all of the citrus fruits, but it was a pain to clean. Pulp got trapped in the webbing, and although a tool is included, it took too much time to pick out the pulp. For a single serving of juice, it wasn’t worth the effort.</p>
<h3>Sunhanny</h3>
<p>We confess that we wanted to test the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C22MYGM/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sunhanny</a> because of its Amazon video that shows it can not only juice citrus fruits but also separate an egg. The Sunhanny has several pieces, and since no instructions were provided, we watched the video again to learn how to use it.</p>
<p>The Sunhanny’s odd petal-shaped piece for juicing oranges fits on top of the reamer, which then locks into the juicer’s 2-cup container. The Sunhanny worked very much like the Urban Trend &#8211; Tango, but lemon pips lodged into its reamer, which has slits like its pulp filter.</p>
<p>To separate an egg, the reamer is inverted, and when you crack an egg into it, the egg white is supposed to drip into the container. Sadly, it didn’t work, and half of the egg white clung stubbornly to the yolk.</p>
<h3>Black+Decker &#8211; CJ650</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M9J34LL/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black+Decker &#8211; CJ650</a> has only one reamer cone, which easily extracted juice from oranges. But the cone was too wide for lemons and limes, and they slipped off if we didn&#8217;t hold them firmly in place.</p>
<p>The pulp-adjustment switch is inside the filter, and once a setting is selected, it can’t be changed until juicing is complete. We tried each of the Black+Decker’s three pulp-adjustment settings; every time, after juicing only one orange, the filter got clogged with pulp and juice.</p>
<h3>Cuisinart &#8211; CCJ-500</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VS32HA/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; CCJ500</a> has three settings that can be adjusted by turning the reamer cone but only when the juicer is unplugged. The reamer cone itself has an unnecessary filter, so pulp got stuck in both the cone and filter, and juice just pooled in the pulp.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart has an additional feature we did like. Once the fruit is completely juiced, you can press down on the juicer’s lid, and it will spin a little more juice out of the collected pulp. However, like the Black+Decker, the filter gets clogged after juicing a single orange, which makes the juicer a hassle to clean. We don’t feel the Cuisinart’s inconvenience justifies its high price.</p>
<h3>IMUSA USA &#8211; Victoria 70009</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O525UL8/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IMUSA USA &#8211; Victoria 70009</a> is one of the most common and basic manual juicers. The IMUSA comes in three sizes for oranges, lemons and limes and is made of two aluminum cups with handles that are painted orange, yellow or green. We tested the size for oranges.</p>
<p>Half of a cut fruit is placed into one cup, which has slits for straining seeds, and the other cup is pressed down by gripping the handle.  Pulp isn’t extracted but is compressed instead, and it does require some hand strength to squeeze out juice.</p>
<p>This type of juicer is great for squeezing juice for a couple cocktails or adding some acidity to a sauce or saute. But if you need to squeeze more than two or three fruits at a time, it’s time-consuming and tiring.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>The small and inexpensive citrus juicers that we tested squeezed lemons and limes equally well. Squeezing a glass of orange juice, however, was more of a challenge, especially — and surprisingly — for the electric juicers.</p>
<p>Our pick for best electric citrus juicer is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011KGTVIY/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dash &#8211; JB065AQ</a>. The Dash juicer has seven settings for adjusting how much pulp is filtered into the juice that can be changed any time while you’re juicing. It’s easy to use, doesn’t clog with excess pulp, and clean-up is a snap. At less than $15, it’s also a great value.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0185NWN62/?tag=ybdjuice-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urban Trend &#8211; Tango</a> is our top pick for manual citrus juicer. It’s a simple, plastic, handheld juicer with two interchangeable and stackable reamer cones that squeeze out every last drop of juice. It has a smart, ergonomic design that fits comfortably in your hand, and its non-skid base prevents slippage when you&#8217;re squeezing juice on a countertop or table.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected containers to test</h2>
<p>Whether you’re looking to reorganize your kitchen cabinets or pantry or want to prevent pests from burrowing into flour, sugar and other baking ingredients, dry food storage containers that are functional and airtight are essential.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, Tupperware was the most recognized brand for food storage containers, and even today, it’s still used as a generic term for all plastic containers. Although Tupperware expanded globally, the company’s sales are primarily made by private parties, while its competitor, the less-expensive Rubbermaid, can be purchased virtually anywhere.</p>
<p>We previously <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-food-storage-container/">reviewed food storage containers</a> that are made for refrigerating, freezing and reheating food, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a>, was our top pick for plastic containers.</p>
<p>For this review of containers for storing dry goods, we added Brilliance&#8217;s line of containers and another well-reviewed Rubbermaid product to our list to see how they held up to other highly rated containers. Amazon reviewers give a lot of love to certain containers, so we selected those that had at least a 4.3-star rating.</p>
<p>Since not everyone wants to use plastic, we decided to test acrylic and glass containers as well to determine whether they were better than plastic for storage of dry goods. The majority of dry food storage containers are sold as sets of three or more different sizes, and even though many may be bought separately, it’s more cost-effective to purchase them as a set.</p>

<p>Every container we tested was heralded as airtight, which is especially important for storing flour, sugar and rice, since they are prone to infestation by Indian-meal moths, more commonly known as pantry moths.</p>
<p>To test whether a container was airtight, we sealed a piece of toilet tissue inside each container, locked its lid and then plunged it into two gallons of water. We held the container under water and revolved it several times. When we removed the container from the water and unsealed the lid, if the tissue paper was wet, the container wasn’t airtight. Only three of the seven storage containers we tested were 100 percent airtight.</p>
<p>Overall, dry food storage containers are either tall rectangles or cylinders. Some were slender modulars, no taller than 10 inches, designed to fit in most kitchen cabinets. Although they would look attractive on a countertop, these containers were too narrow to hold a five-pound bag of flour or to allow scooping flour out with a one-cup measuring cup.</p>
<p>Some people might only want containers for beans, rice and pasta, but we leaned heavily toward those that stored baking ingredients in a shape that allows easy access.</p>

<p>Not only were the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWS0LK9/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Progressive &#8211; Prepworks ProKeeper</a> containers airtight, they’re truly unique from the others we tested — or any other containers we’ve seen. Although the ProKeepers could be used for storing any food item, each container in the six-container set is designed for storing a specific dry-goods product.</p>
<p>For example, the 15-cup flour container can hold an entire five-pound bag of flour, and it has a built-in leveler for leveling flour from a measuring cup, which easily fits into the container. The brown-sugar ProKeeper includes a terra-cotta disc that, when moistened, prevents brown sugar from hardening. The powdered-sugar ProKeeper has a sifting spoon, and the two mini containers each have a shaker for herbs, spices or cupcake sprinkles.</p>
<p>Progressive sells other containers for coffee, cereal, grains and pasta separately, and each has an individual feature, such as a coffee scoop or a wide-mouth pour spout for the cereal container. The herb ProKeeper is ingenious: washed herbs drain into a basket, and excess water drips into the lower part of the container, which can then be emptied through a built-in drain hole.</p>

<p>Each container is made from <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-food-storage-container/#health">BPA-free</a> crystal-clear plastic, and lids are latched shut and sealed with a silicone gasket that can be removed for cleaning.</p>
<p>The containers were perfectly airtight, <i>except</i> for the white sugar container, which we found frustrating, because of a small design flaw. The white sugar ProKeeper has a pour spout, and although all other ProKeepers have a ¼-inch-thick silicone gasket for sealing their lids, the sugar container’s is thinner and doesn’t secure the spout cover tightly enough.</p>
<p>The white sugar container is large enough to store four pounds of sugar, so it’s a shame the clever pour spout didn’t work better in keeping contents airtight. However, the sugar container could certainly be used for storing beans or pasta or other dry foods that aren’t plagued by pantry pests and another of the airtight ProKeepers used for storing white sugar instead.</p>
<p>The six-piece set is slightly more expensive than other sets, but the superb design features and bonuses, like the terra cotta disc, are worth the added cost.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Progressive &#8211; Prepworks ProKeeper six-piece set is the most unique and well-designed container system that we tested.</li>
<li>Each one has features for a specific ingredient, such as flour, brown sugar or cake toppings.</li>
<li>In testing, the ProKeepers were completely airtight, except for the sugar container, which has a pour spout that didn’t seal.</li>
<li>Other containers for coffee, grains, herbs and pasta are also available individually.</li>

<p>The thoughtful design of the Progressive &#8211; Prepworks containers gave them a slight edge over our runner-up, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076N6DLFJ/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> four-container set. In our review of food storage containers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> won best plastic food storage container for refrigerating, freezing and reheating food, because of its durability, ease of opening/closing and its 100% airtight seal, thanks to a thick, built-in silicone gasket.</p>
<p>Other than size and shape, there’s no difference between the Brilliance all-purpose containers and the Brilliance dry food storage containers that we tested for this review. The dry food set is, however, better suited for pantry storage, taking advantage of vertical space with taller containers.</p>
<p>The eight-piece set — each lid counts as a piece — includes a 9.25-inch-tall, 16-cup container that holds a five-pound bag of flour, a 12-cup container for sugar, a 9.25-inch-tall and narrow 6.6-cup container for pasta (which is a half-inch too short for uncooked spaghetti) and a squat, rectangular 3.2-cup container.</p>

<p>The small 3.2-cup container brought the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance set down a notch in our rating, since it’s just a regular food-storage container and is too small for standard pantry items. However, additional sizes, including a container tall enough for spaghetti, are available to purchase either in sets or individually.</p>
<p>The eight-piece set is modestly priced, but it’s likely you’ll need to add to it for storing more than three dry food products in your kitchen or pantry. Still, the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance containers are one of three containers we tested that you can completely rely on to keep pantry goods fresh and pest-free.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance containers are made of durable and crystal-clear Tritan plastic, easy to open and close and are 100 percent airtight.</li>
<li>The three larger containers are great for storing dry pantry goods, such as flour, sugar and rice.</li>
<li>The smaller container in the set is too small for pantry items, but it’s still excellent for refrigerated food storage.</li>
<li>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance set is well-priced, but you’ll probably need to buy other pieces individually to store more pantry goods.</li>

<h3>Bellemain &#8211; Acrylic Canister Set</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZXY51MA/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bellemain &#8211; Acrylic Canister Set</a> is the only other set we tested that was airtight. Honestly, we were surprised, because they’re very lightweight and their chrome latches are thin and wobbly. The containers look like glass Mason jars and would be an attractive addition to a kitchen counter. They’re supposedly unbreakable, but the lids and latches might not survive being accidentally knocked to the floor.</p>
<p>Because they’re airtight, the Bellemain will keep flour and sugar fresh, but they’re only large enough for scooping out a half-cup. If you wish to store dried food items, such as beans, lentils and short pasta, these glass containers would be a decent alternative to plastic containers.</p>
<h3>OXO Good Grips &#8211; POP Containers</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D78X2V6/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; POP Container</a> set includes two tall, narrow canisters, two small narrow canisters and a squat square. None are large enough to hold flour and sugar or wide enough for scooping with a measuring cup.</p>
<p>The POP lids are a great idea. They secure by pushing down on a large button in the center of the lid, which lowers the silicone seal into the lip of the container; pushing the button again releases the seal. Unfortunately, the seal isn’t airtight, and during our test, water seeped into the canister. If water can find its way in, so can bugs. The POP container set was the most expensive set we tested, and even though they look nice, they just don’t work.</p>
<h3>Brabantia &#8211; Glass Storage Containers</h3>
<p>There aren’t many glass containers available, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JFWP6EO/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brabantia</a> is highly rated on Amazon. They’re not made of heavy-duty glass, like a Mason jar, but have a similar weight to an all-purpose wine glass. They have pretty colored lids in neutral Martha-Stewart-ish tones that are interchangeable. They’re too small for holding more than a pound of flour or sugar, and because they’re not airtight, we could see them being used for storing cotton puffs or Q-tips.</p>
<h3>Chef’s Path &#8211; Food Storage Container Set</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L6MH96Z/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chef’s Path</a> seven-piece set includes containers of four different heights, one of which is designed specifically for spaghetti. However, because they’re all only four-inches wide, they’re useless for storing flour or sugar, unless you want to scoop it out with a tablespoon. Since this is a modular design, the lids fit all the containers. The Chef’s Path lids secure with a vertical latch that can be closed on either side of the lid. A very thin silicone band isn’t enough to seal the container, and during our tests, water flooded in. The Chef’s Path containers have a sleek, modern design, but they aren’t airtight.</p>
<h3>Rubbermaid &#8211; Modular Containers</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003BKGJ1A/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 1776464 Modular Containers</a> are basic containers for a kitchen cabinet or pantry; they won’t be sitting pretty on your counter. The rectangular Modulars are wide and deep enough for scooping out flour and sugar, and the bright-red lids are interchangeable. Frequent criticism of the Rubbermaid Modulars is that the lids are ill-fitting and difficult to snap on. It does take a bit of effort, and we assumed the seal was secure. However, like most of the containers we tested, the Rubbermaid Modulars failed to be airtight.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Dry food storage containers need to be functional and airtight, but only two of the seven products we tested were both.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWS0LK9/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Progressive &#8211; Prepworks ProKeepers</a> were each specifically designed for storing a particular ingredient. The flour container is wide enough for scooping and has a built-in leveler; the container for brown sugar includes a terra cotta disc that prevents brown sugar from drying out.</p>
<p>Only the white-sugar container had a design flaw that made it not completely airtight; all other containers in the six-canister set were 100% airtight. We also like that Progressive has matching containers for coffee, cereal, grains and herbs in its product line.</p>
<p>A close runner-up is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076N6DLFJ/?tag=ybddrystor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> four-container set. These durable and attractive Tritan plastic containers are perfectly airtight and wide enough for scooping and measuring. The set includes a small container that’s better suited for refrigerated food storage, but like Progressive, Rubbermaid also sells other Brilliance containers that are intended for particular food products.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[We compared and tested authentic copper cookware with two copper alternatives and found that the 100-percent copper pan cooks best. But an excellent alternative is Anolon - Nouvelle Copper, which cooks almost the same as copper.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e compared how authentic copper cookware cooked to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QB9TPS/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper</a> copper-core cookware and the popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDU01TU/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Copper Chef</a>, ceramic-coated cookware that’s purportedly copper-infused. The copper pan had a slight edge over the nonstick Anolon, which cooked food almost as evenly and quickly. The Copper Chef, however, is made of cheap, lightweight aluminum and didn’t have copper’s heat conductivity or distribution.</p>

<p>Copper cookware is arguably the type of cookware most cherished by professional chefs and skilled home cooks.</p>
<p>Julia Child firmly believed that every serious-minded cook should own at least one copper pot or pan. She discovered the benefits of cooking with copper during her years in France, where she purchased the thirty copper pots and pans now on display at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. Julia cooked with those beloved pots for 45 years on all of her television programs, because <a href="https://www.copper.org/consumers/arts/2010/may/Julia_Child_Copper_P.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">copper allows for the precision that French cookery requires</a>.</p>
<p>Centuries before Julia filmed her first episode of The French Chef, the ancient Romans discovered that copper heats faster and more evenly than other metals, because of copper’s heat and electrical conductivity, which is second only to silver. Copper also cools very quickly, so once the copper pan is removed from the heat source, its temperature rapidly drops, which helps prevent a delicate sauce from overcooking or separating.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Copper is highly reactive: </b>A reactive metal like copper conducts heat very efficiently, but it also reacts with acidic foods. Tomatoes, vinegar and lemon can absorb not only a metallic flavoring but the metal itself.</p>
<p><b>Copper pots and pans are lined with nonreactive metal: </b>Copper cookware has been traditionally lined with nonreactive tin, which is not affected by acidic foods. With extended use over many years, tin does darken and wear away, so a tin-lined copper pan needs to be eventually re-tinned, or copper will leach into food, which our bodies can’t process and eliminate.</p>
<p>In recent years, copper pots and pans have been lined with stainless steel. Stainless steel, of course, is a hard, durable metal, but it lacks tin’s conductivity. Stainless liners are often coated with a nonstick material like PTFE (Teflon is the name brand), which, as we discussed in our reviews of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-pan/">nonstick pans</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/">nonstick cookware</a>, can be hazardous if the pan gets too hot.</p>
<p>Tin, on the other hand, is naturally nonstick and has low toxicity. For copper cookware, it&#8217;s the preferred metal for lining.</p>
<p><b>Copper cookware can’t be used for all cooking methods: </b>Tin has a melting point of 450° F, so a tin-lined copper pan should <i>never</i> be used for high-heat searing. For steaks, burgers and other foods you want browned, use a cast-iron pan instead. Copper is best for low-heat cooking, such as sauces, seafood, omelettes and other egg dishes.</p>
<p><b>Copper pots are expensive: </b>A copper saucepan from such well-known manufacturers as Mauviel and Falk runs about $450, and an entire cookware set can be as high as $2,000.</p>
<p>However, vintage pieces are available online. We purchased an authentic omelette pan, made in France, on Ebay for $40. Though vintage copper cookware will probably need polishing and retinning, it is much more affordable than buying copper cookware brand new.</p>

<h3>Copper-core</h3>

<p>Copper-core cookware is made primarily from more common metals, with a four- or five-layer base composed of a thin layer of copper sandwiched between layers of aluminum and/or stainless steel. The copper-core cookware that is made primarily of stainless steel is approximately triple the price of aluminum cookware.</p>
<p>The copper layer improves stainless steel’s heat conductivity and distribution, and the stainless steel makes the cookware more durable. Copper-core cookware also withstands higher temperatures and, because of the stainless-steel base, can be used on induction cooktops.</p>
<p>Copper-core cookware that is composed primarily of aluminum is considerably less expensive and usually has a non-stick surface.</p>
<h3>Copper-infused ceramic-coated</h3>
<p>This type of inexpensive, nonstick cookware is very popular, thanks to aggressive infomercials by two rival companies, Red Copper and Copper Chef. Their cookware is made of lightweight aluminum and is coated with a ceramic that they claim is infused with copper and can handle higher temperatures than 100% copper cookware.</p>
<p>Both companies market their cookware as all-purpose pans for searing, broiling, braising and frying: cooking methods that should never be used with copper.</p>

<p>We decided to see how well a copper-core pan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QB9TPS/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper</a>, and a copper-infused ceramic-coated pan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDU01TU/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Copper Chef</a>, fared against the real thing, a vintage tin-lined copper pan that we purchased on eBay.</p>
<p>The oval copper pan, generally used for cooking omelettes and fish, was manufactured in France, and although we don’t know when, it was obviously a much-used pan in someone’s kitchen. Its tin lining was scratched and had darkened to a gray patina, and the copper was spotted and tarnished.</p>
<p>Using a home remedy of Kosher salt, vinegar and flour, we rubbed the mixture onto the copper, and its years of neglect magically wiped off. Though our pan didn’t look quite new again, it was still a pretty pan that helped us understand why people would pay a small fortune for new copper cookware.</p>
<p>We conducted several simple but illustrative cooking tests. We used no oil or butter, and everything was cooked at medium heat.</p>
<p><b>Fried eggs: </b>We cracked whole eggs into the center and far edge of each pan and noted whether the center egg cooked faster than the side egg, or whether they both cooked at the same time. We also tested the pan’s nonstick capability by turning the eggs over and then scrambling the yolk and uncooked white.</p>
<p><b>Pancakes: </b>We used a <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/" target="_blank" rel="&quot;noopener">basic recipe for pancakes</a> and poured a pancake into the center and two pancakes on either side of the pan. Similar to the egg test, we were looking for evenly cooked pancakes. When we flipped the pancakes, we noted how the pancakes had browned and if they slid out of the pan without effort.</p>
<p><b>Hamburger: </b>We pan-fried a ⅓-pound, ¾-inch-thick hamburger made of 93% lean grass-fed organic beef. Each burger was fried for five minutes on each side. We were looking for an evenly browned and crisp exterior with a medium-rare interior.</p>

<p>The Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper was an admirable competitor, but our traditional 100% copper pan was the winner. As mentioned earlier, copper pans are famous for heat conductivity, and our vintage copper didn’t disappoint. The copper heated up quicker than the Anolon and Copper Chef, and after a couple of burnt pancakes, we turned down the heat source to medium-low, since it clearly didn’t need to be as high as the other two pans did.</p>
<p>Across the board, results were perfect, although the copper did require precision in controlling the heat level. Since this particular pan is intended for cooking omelettes, we poured in a couple of beaten eggs and were amazed by how rapidly it cooked and how easily the omelette could be folded and rolled. We don’t know how old our copper pan is, but it’s remarkable that its tin lining’s held up so well.</p>
<p>By the time we got to the hamburger, the pan was very hot, so we removed it from the cooktop and adjusted the heat. Our copper pan is oval, so its edges hang over the cooktop’s round heating element. We thought that the edges of the pan would be less hot; but we were wrong. We leaned the burger against the curved sides of the pan, and the burger cooked as well as it did in the center of the pan.</p>
<p>Clean-up was simple: once the pan cooled, we washed it with warm soapy water, and food residue came off with no scrubbing needed (harsh scrubbing erodes the tin lining). Copper can spot easily from water droplets, so all copper cookware must be towel-dried, and it should <i>never</i> be put into the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Copper pot and pans aren&#8217;t for everyone or for every type of food. You need to continually adjust the heat level to prevent food from overcooking or burning. But with trial and error and some basic culinary skills, you’ll soon learn to cook with copper cookware and turn out meals like a professional — and dare we say, like the French Chef herself.</p>

It requires precision and skill by the home chef, but food will cook quickly and evenly. It's very expensive cookware, and Mauviel M'heritage is one of the best.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JSHJ9P2/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Tin-lined copper cookware is hard to find brand new, but one of the best makers of copper ware is Mauviel M’heritage: it&#8217;s 90% copper with stainless-steel lining. If you want to take the financial plunge, you can purchase <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KI0FG9W/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an entire set</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JSHJ9P2/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">individual pieces</a> on Amazon.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>100% copper has superb heat conductivity, so it heats up fast, and heat distribution, so food cooks evenly on all surfaces of the pan.</li>
<li>Traditional copper pans are lined with tin, which is naturally nonstick and holds up for many years. New copper cookware is lined with stainless steel, which isn’t nonstick and doesn’t conduct heat as well as tin.</li>
<li>Copper is very expensive, and if you can’t afford to buy it new, you can find vintage copper pans online for much less and restore them.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QB9TPS/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper</a> cookware is for people who don’t want to invest in the real thing nor deal with copper’s fussy upkeep. The cookware has only a super-thin layer (0.6 millimeters) of copper sandwiched between anodized aluminum layers, but the skillets we tested did perform very similarly to our authentic copper pan.</p>
<p>The Anolon has some heft to it, thanks to the magnetic stainless steel base, which also makes the pans induction-friendly. The 10-inch skillet weighs in at almost 3 pounds, and the 8.5-inch skillet is lighter at 1 pound. The 10-inch skillet isn’t really suited to flipping flapjacks and omelettes, unless you’ve got wrist strength.</p>
<p>That quibble aside, the pans gave great results. The copper layer worked in conjunction with the aluminum layers to evenly distribute heat over the entire surface of the pan. The stainless-steel base prevented the pan from heating up as rapidly as the vintage copper, but once the pan was hot, it was easier to regulate its heat level.</p>
<p>Pancake batter poured in the center and sides of the pan cooked evenly at the same time, and when we turned the pancakes, they were golden brown with crispy ridges. Fried eggs stuck a little, but when we flipped and scrambled the yolks and uncooked whites, they released easily. The hamburger also browned evenly, and similar to the copper pan, when we pressed the burger to the sides of the pan, it continued to sizzle.</p>

<p>In our review of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-pan/">the best nonstick pan</a>, we chose the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag=ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Advanced</a> as the best because it was 100% nonstick during our tests. The Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper is coated with Autograph 2 &#8212; Dupont&#8217;s high-end nonstick coating &#8212;  but the manufacturer improved the pan’s overall design by recessing the handle-rivet heads on the inside, so they’re flat and also nonstick. The rivets in other nonstick pans are raised, and food particles get wedged between them, which we found annoying to remove.</p>
<p>Cleanup was a cinch; however, the attractive copper band on the pan’s base (a quarter-inch ring where the copper layer is exposed) needs to be routinely cleaned and polished, or it will stain and tarnish.</p>
<p>On the negative side, even with meticulous care, nonstick coating loses its effectiveness after two or three years of regular use, and the pans will need to be replaced. So, there’s no reason to spend a lot on any nonstick pan. The Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper 10-inch and 8.5-inch skillets are sold as a set for only $46, which we think is a great price for an alternative to copper cookware.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The well-priced Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper is made of a copper layer sandwiched between durable anodized aluminum with a stainless-steel base, so it can be used on any cooktop, including induction.</li>
<li>The pans we tested heated slower than the copper pan we tested, but once hot, heat was evenly distributed across the surface and sides of the pans.</li>
<li>The Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper has a high-end nonstick coating, which, unlike copper cookware, eventually loses its effectiveness, and the pans will need to be replaced.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BDU01TU/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Copper Chef &#8211; KC15057-02000</a> copper-infused ceramic-coated pans are advertised as the only pans you’ll ever need for any cooking method. Don’t you believe it. There are hundreds of photos posted by dissatisfied consumers depicting their Copper Chef pans with burnt-on food that won’t wash off and pans blackened from high heat.</p>
<p>Copper Chef’s pans are made of very lightweight aluminum, and their interiors and exteriors are sprayed with a ceramic coating that purportedly contains copper. It’s impossible to find online how much copper infuses this coating, but our best guess is it’s negligible. According to advertising, the copper-infused coating will increase the pan’s conductivity as well as make it nonstick.</p>
<p>Testing proved otherwise. The pans have a thick aluminum disk on the bottom, which is supposed to distribute heat over the entire surface of the pan. It doesn’t. The bottom of the pan certainly gets hot, but no heat radiates past the circumference of the disk, leaving the sides of the pan cool. The hamburger cooked in the direct center of the pan, but when we moved it to any side, it steamed but didn’t brown.</p>
<p>The pan also has a convex surface that creates a gutter along the sides into which any liquid flows. Consequently, egg whites dribbled into the gutter, creating egg tendrils, and pancake batter pooled, producing oblong and  unevenly cooked pancakes.</p>
<p>A major problem with marketing a pan as all-purpose is that high heat destroys nonstick coating, which should never be used for broiling meat or frying French fries. Copper Chef claims that their cookware can withstand temperatures up to 850°F. Since most ovens can only be set to 550°F, this marketing ploy is ridiculous. It comes as no surprise that so many consumers are enraged when food soon clings to their destroyed Copper Chef pan.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Copper Chef pans are pretty cheap, so if you want to try it out, buy a single pan instead of a set.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>In our matchup between an authentic 100% copper pan, a copper-core pan and a copper-infused ceramic-coated pan, it was a tie between the real copper and the copper-core Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper.</p>
<p>Copper is justifiably famous for its heat conductivity and distribution, and in our testing, the 100% copper pan cooked everything beautifully and quickly, even at medium-low heat. Cooking with copper, though, does take some getting used to, and copper cookware requires periodic maintenance to keep it shiny and the metal lining nonstick. It&#8217;s also extremely expensive, but it’s easy to find affordable vintage copper pieces, like we did, online.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QB9TPS/?tag=ybdcoppan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; Nouvelle Copper</a> gave us similar results as the vintage copper pan. It didn’t heat up as fast, but when hot, heat was distributed over the surface and sides of the pan, and food was evenly cooked. The Anolon&#8217;s high-end nonstick coating was, for the most part, nonstick. Cleanup was easier with the Anolon, and for two skillets at $46, it’s well priced.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter comparing lab tests from dozens of filter systems, we bought the four top faucet water filters and compared them with filtered water from pitchers, reverse osmosis and bottled water suppliers. The best faucet water filter was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0P/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; FF100</a>, with its compact size and excellent performance certifications. Brita also adds a multi-pattern spray and push-button filter replacement. Our runner-up is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VZ2LMM/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DuPont &#8211; WWFM350</a>, which will go longer between filter changes but isn&#8217;t as compact.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-selected">How we selected products to test</h2>
<p>To find the best water filter for faucets, we started with searches for reviews. The number of comprehensive reviews that compare the best on-faucet water filter systems is surprisingly low, with top hits giving little if any evidence they&#8217;d actually used the products or compared to competing products.</p>
<p>Faucet water filters are a niche category; they’re not as popular as the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">water filter pitchers we&#8217;ve tested</a> but are easier to purchase and install than under-sink filtration systems. The big players from the world of pitchers are selling faucet-mount systems, but there are also hundreds of imitators cashing in.</p>
<p>The price of a mystery-brand filter is usually slightly lower than the faucet-mount water filter systems you&#8217;d recognize, but you&#8217;re giving up a lot of confidence for a few dollars per year. Some of the cheapest filters aren&#8217;t even specifying what kind of filter they use.</p>
<p>To ensure we were testing products that are trustworthy, we only bought filters that had been <a href="#NSF">independently certified by NSF International</a>. These certificates mean that a filter will perform as advertised even well beyond the rated life of the filter, and their laboratory controls are far more comprehensive and strict than we could hope to achieve in our test homes. NSF doesn&#8217;t make recommendations about the quality or suitability of a product, but they do tell you what a filter actually takes out of your drinking water.</p>
<p>The tricky part of choosing a water filter, even with that assurance, is that not every filter is given the same tests. A manufacturer chooses which compounds to test against, and NSF only lists a pass rating. If a certain contaminant was tested and the filter was poor at filtering it, neither the manufacturer nor NSF has to tell you.</p>
<p>We searched the NSF database for faucet water filters that had been tested and listed, and we bought all the most recent models that had been at least tested to remove lead.</p>
<p>We considered countertop units that attach to a faucet with hoses, but after comparing cost of ownership and the reliability and awkwardness (not to mention the increased up-front cost and the awkwardness of the hoses) we decided to stick with filters that mount directly to the faucet spout.</p>
<p>After finding the brands who had paid for comprehensive testing of filter performance, we checked customer reviews to see if there were features that stood out or had reliability concerns.</p>
<p>Sadly, all of the filters we found with trustworthy reviews have reports of failure. Any time you&#8217;re running water through small tubes and channels, mineral build-up is going to cause problems. The restricted flow of the filter only makes that worse. Still, we weighed the reports of filters popping off and splitting apart carefully when weighing the different models available.</p>

[table id=282 /]
<h2 id="what-to-filter">Do I really need a filter?</h2>
<p>This is the hardest question for us to answer. In many ways, the answer for most people with internet access will typically be &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to filter anything, your water is safe.&#8221; But that&#8217;s not exactly the whole picture.</p>
<h3>U.S. water safety</h3>
<p>Water treatment is what makes drinking water safe for most of us. Some people have a private well that they need to monitor themselves, but the vast majority of the United States relies on a local water authority. You can look up who that is and how well they&#8217;re managing your water <a href="https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/sfdw/f?p=108:200::::::" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) database</a>. This tracks who supplies water and whether contaminants have been found above allowed levels.</p>
<p>If your local water authority doesn&#8217;t mail it directly to you, you can also read <a href="https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/safewater/f?p=136:102::::::" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a consumer confidence report, also tracked by the EPA</a>. This lets you see not just a passing grade but also details about how close household water is to goals set by community health agencies. They&#8217;ll also report on &#8220;secondary&#8221; standards, which cover water-quality factors that aren&#8217;t considered health threats.</p>
<p>If you see a listed contaminant that&#8217;s too close to the limit for comfort, you can check for that contaminant on filter ratings before you buy.</p>
<h3>Chlorine and taste</h3>
<p>The main reason to filter drinking water is that chlorine — the disinfectant used in civic water supplies — doesn&#8217;t taste very good. The amount of chlorine used is regulated and checked by your water authority, but you can make most city water taste better by filtering out chlorine.</p>
<p>When we checked with brand-new and well-used water-pitcher filters, we found that even &#8220;used up&#8221; granular carbon filters are very effective at removing chlorine. This is all covered in NSF standard 42, which is a common certification for consumer water filters.</p>
<h3>What about Lead pipes?</h3>
<p>Water in our tester&#8217;s city is clean, but the local consumer confidence report says that over 90 percent of the homes have some lead in water tested from the tap. That&#8217;s all because of old pipes inside houses, not from the civic water supply. It&#8217;s about one third of the allowable level of lead but well above the public health goal.</p>
<p>This is a similar situation to homes in Flint, Michigan before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flint water crisis</a>, where switching water supplies caused old pipes, formerly safe, to release lead at unsafe levels.</p>
<p>In response to the Flint crisis, lead filtration has become one of the most heavily-advertised features of water filters. All of the filtration systems we recommend are specifically certified to remove lead.</p>
<h2 id="NSF">NSF filter ratings</h2>
<p>NSF International started as a branch of the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan. The name of the agency then was the &#8220;National Sanitation Foundation,&#8221; though they&#8217;re officially just NSF International these days.</p>
<p>NSF works with many food, health and safety agencies worldwide as a private certification agency.  Along with other standard-setters like with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) they establish what&#8217;s safe, then test and certify products ranging from bakeware to medical devices. They&#8217;re the main certifier of water filtration equipment, and they set tests standards based on input from various stakeholders, including manufacturers of water filters.</p>
<p>NSF isn&#8217;t an agency that recommends products, though — they only test and certify. If you see an advertisement claiming NSF testing, that advertisement doesn&#8217;t tell you the complete story of what was or was not successful in the product&#8217;s testing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/water-quality/water-filters-testing-treatment/standards-water-treatment-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There are two standard tests for NSF-certified water filters</a>, and many more that aren&#8217;t commonly requested or advertised:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NSF/ANSI standard 42</strong> certifies that a water filter can &#8220;reduce aesthetic impurities such as chlorine and taste/odor.&#8221; This is not linked to any health claim, and it&#8217;s an easy standard to meet with activated carbon. Basically every water filter more sophisticated than a mesh strainer meets this standard.</li>
<li><strong>NSF/ANSI standard 53</strong> is the other common test, and in this case certifies that a filter can reduce levels of tested contaminants in water from unsafe to safe. Every filter we looked at has some NSF 53 certification, though not all are certified for the same contaminants; the manufacturer chooses what to test for.</li>
<li><strong>NSF/ANSI standard 53 &#8211; VOC</strong> is a subset of the safety test that covers volatile organic compounds (&#8220;VOCs&#8221;). These are compounds that evaporate quickly and require a different testing regimen: typically, VOC performance is tested by filtering water loaded with chloroform through the filter, and NSF infers the results for other contaminants based on past lab work. A longer list, then, doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean anything.</li>
<li><strong>NSF/ANSI standard 401</strong> is another sub-set of standard 53. This test specifically covers 15 contaminants that aren&#8217;t yet regulated by health or water quality agencies. These include pesticides, flame retardants, detergents and pharmaceuticals. Only two of the brands we tested had been certified with these specific tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that not every filter is rated for the same compounds makes comparing results tricky.</p>
<p>For example, it could be that one filter manufacturer has embedded some other filter medium in their activated carbon block so that it will capture metals better; if another manufacturer hasn&#8217;t advertised their filter removing that metal, it could be that the filter failed a test.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it could simply be that the filter manufacturers are counting on the public only looking at a few key contaminants. Testing for lead, for example, is a no-brainer after the highly-publicized Flint water crisis, but few consumers are actively seeking solutions for mercury contamination. Leaving mercury off the test list might be a cost-saving measure, or it could even be that the performance is just slightly poor enough (say, only 85 percent removed instead of 98 percent) that it sticks out on the data sheet and makes the filter look worse than it would otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="water-test-scam">The water test scam</h2>
<p>Hardware stores often provide &#8220;free&#8221; water testing kits, but be careful: the hardware store test kits are specifically designed to get you to buy a reverse osmosis system by emphasizing the mineral content of your water.</p>
<p>Some salesmen will even use deceptive tests to convince you that you have things in your water that aren&#8217;t actually there. See <a href="http://chemistryhall.com/dont-get-tricked-water-purification-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this account of a chemist explaining false tests to a salesman</a> who doesn&#8217;t even seem to understand what he&#8217;s actually testing.</p>
<p>Many consumers have been duped into paying for a system at above-market-value, and often on a store credit card with predatory interest policies.</p>
<p>Agencies like the <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/water/docs/factsheet/beware.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota Department of Health</a> and the <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/__85256CC5006DFCC3.nsf/0/3D0FD1650FC920C485256CC900698282?Open&amp;Highlight=0,in-home,water,test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Attorney General</a> have issued statements specifically advising consumers to be cautious about purchasing filters after seeing tests performed by installation companies. Class-action lawsuits are being fought all over the country, and one has even reached <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/17-1471.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Supreme Court</a>.</p>
<p>You can pay an independent laboratory for water testing, but you still need to know what is a safe and reasonable amount of the contaminants they find, and you still have to decide what else you might want to improve.</p>
<h2 id="important-features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Installation: </b>Faucet filters thread onto your faucet spout so pressure can force water through the filter. Each system comes with three thread adapters for all the common kitchen faucet aerator fittings, but none will work with a pull-out hand sprayer or other non-threaded spouts. Bathroom faucets won&#8217;t usually work, either.</p>
<p><b>Size and bulk:</b> The systems we found all use approximately the same size of filter cartridge, but some are much bigger than others. A big filter system could get in the way when you&#8217;re trying to wash dishes or fill a stock pot.</p>
<p><b>Flow options:</b> All faucet-mount filters allow you to bypass the filter. You don&#8217;t want to deplete the filter and settle for reduced water pressure when you&#8217;re washing dishes. Some filters automatically switch back to unfiltered water with a spring-return switch, while others offer multiple spray patterns in the unfiltered position.</p>
<p><b>Filter ratings:</b> All of the filters we found use carbon block filters, so they&#8217;re comparable. They&#8217;re not all certified to remove the same contaminants, though. <a href="#NSF">See our section on NSF certification for the details</a>.</p>
<p><b>Vertical or horizontal filter: </b>This is one of the biggest differences between designs. A vertical filter mount gives you a bit more room around your faucet spout, but they can drip a little leftover water from inside the filter. In comparison, horizontal-mount filters won&#8217;t dribble as much after you shut off the flow.</p>
<h2>How carbon filters work</h2>
<p>All of the water filter faucets in this category rely on carbon block filtration. That&#8217;s different from activated carbon granules, like you&#8217;d find in the budget pick from our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">water filter pitcher review</a>.</p>
<p>A sheet of carbon sticks to other atoms and most carbon-based (organic) molecules, which also tend to be the worst-tasting. Activated carbon has so many microscopic pores, it has an active surface area of almost a million square feet per ounce.</p>
<p>Carbon block filters use compressed charcoal as a medium, which means the paths through the filter will capture most particles larger than a micron. It takes extra pressure to get water flowing through: Granule-based filters pass water much more easily and can use gravity-feed systems, but they also allow more contaminants to slip past.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, carbon filters are very good for capturing everything in water except dissolved minerals, metals and salts. Carbon filters are even great at filtering chlorine, which is typically the worst-tasting stuff in city water.</p>
<p>So, what about those dissolved minerals? Well, there&#8217;s good news and bad news. If you&#8217;re worried about heavy metals like lead, newer carbon filters work much better than traditional granulated carbon systems like the classic Brita pitcher. All the filters we tested are certified to handle lead, and most are also certified to take out mercury.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about fluoride and other dissolved minerals, you&#8217;ll have to use a more complicated system with another filter type alongside a carbon filter or a full-on reverse-osmosis system or distiller that removes basically everything.</p>
<p>The ion-exchange beads in a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/zerowater/">Zero Water gravity filters</a> (and by many water softener systems) are the most effective way to get rid of the rest of the dissolved minerals in tap water. We started using a Zero Water to eliminate &#8220;white dust&#8221; mineral residue from hard water after testing for our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-humidifier/">humidifier review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-essential-oil-diffuser/">essential oil diffuser review</a>. It&#8217;s an effective solution that doesn&#8217;t require any expensive equipment installations. The more minerals you&#8217;ve got in your water, though, the more quickly a Zero Water filter will be used up.</p>
<p>If fluoride is the compound you&#8217;re specifically trying to eliminate, an activated alumina filter medium can be used in multi-stage filter systems along with carbon  filters. The alumina requires a much slower flow rate to be effective, though, so this is not a common design, even in under-sink filter systems. Usually the best way to remove fluoride is a full reverse-osmosis system.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/faucetfilter_install.mp4.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Installing and using these filters was, thankfully, very easy. All the kits came with adapters for internal or external threading, but you will need to install it on a faucet with a threaded aerator of some kind. If you have a pull-out hand sprayer or other unique spout, these filters won&#8217;t be able to attach.</p>
<h3>Cost of ownership</h3>
[table id=280 /]
<p>We looked at average prices for filters and compared the cost of filtering a gallon of water every day with each system. We also factored the cost of replacing the system itself every 18 months.</p>
<p>Most people will be able to run these systems for much longer than that, but if you get sediment or calcium building up inside, any of these could start to leak from the pressure forcing water through the carbon block. Also, you can&#8217;t replace the battery for any of the filter replacement lights.</p>
<h3>Taste testing</h3>
<p>We got our family of taste-testers to compare these filters to our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/">top-ranked water filter pitchers</a>, the Zero Water and Brita &#8211; Longlast. On the whole, the faucet filters were neck-and-neck with the Brita and just ahead of Zero Water. The average scores in the blind test were very close.</p>
<h3>Dissolved solids and lab tests</h3>
[table id=281 /]
<p>We used a conductivity meter to test for electrolytic dissolved minerals in our water, which includes everything from salt to sulphates. The faucet filters are leaving basically the same amount of dissolved minerals in our (fairly hard) Southern California water as the Brita &#8211; Longlast pitcher does. Even the best water filter for a sink faucet can&#8217;t match <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/#top-pick">Zero Water&#8217;s party trick</a> of removing all dissolved minerals.</p>
<h3>Chlorine</h3>
<p>We wanted to see if any of these filters would show a different result when it comes to taste’s biggest enemy, chlorine. Our chlorine test kit can detect a .01 part-per-million difference in total chlorine.</p>
<p>The tap water we tested had between 0.7 and 1 PPM of chlorine. We found that any water filter we try, no matter how long it had been in use, would remove all detectable traces of chlorine. The faucet filters gave the same great results.</p>

<p>As we used these filters over our first week of daily testing, we quickly realized that size was a more important factor than performance for kitchen use. The filters didn&#8217;t prevent our filling a stockpot or washing dishes, but when we rinsed off a baking sheet or did other awkward sink-filling work it was more difficult with the bulky filter in the way.</p>
<p>You can remove and re-attach these filters without tools in most cases, so you could take off a filter if it gets in the way of filling or washing something on occasion, but it became quickly apparent that the smaller filters were easier to live with.</p>
<h2 id="top-pick">Top pick: Brita &#8211; FF-100</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0P/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; FF-100</a> faucet water filter system squeaks ahead of every other filter system we tried in most respects. Brita has been around the home water filter market longer than anyone, and their experience shows in the refinements they&#8217;ve made to this system.</p>
<p>First and foremost, this is the most compact faucet filter we found. It&#8217;s still an awkward lump hovering over your sink, but the vertical orientation of the filter cylinder gives you a little bit more access than other designs. The fact that the filter output comes from the bottom means some dripping after you turn off the flow as gravity pulls the last few drops out of the filter block, but on the whole, it makes more sense than a horizontal filter.</p>
<p>This is an update of Brita&#8217;s old filter design, the SAFF-100. The plug-in filter cartridges are the same across old and new Brita faucet-mount systems, so performance is identical.</p>
<p>The main difference between the two systems is how the flow selection works: The old system used a wing-nut-shaped twist-knob, while the new system is a paddle that you push back and forth. The size and shape of the paddle is similar, but it&#8217;s slightly easier to push than to twist.</p>
<p>Brita also added a second spray pattern to the non-filtered flow outlet. A spray stream on your faucet, like the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-shower-head/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spray-type shower heads we&#8217;ve reviewed</a>, typically uses less water to do the same washing and may be even better for rinsing if you have low water pressure.</p>
<h3>Filter Performance</h3>
<p>Brita&#8217;s certified filter performance is good. It doesn&#8217;t have the very best numbers in every category, but water-filter performance is tricky to evaluate: How many parts per trillion of atrazine or mercury is a problem if you&#8217;re drinking from a safe water source?</p>
<p>We relied mostly on the NSF tests to evaluate filter performance for this review, because, let&#8217;s face it, we can&#8217;t be more thorough than they are. More to the point, these filters are all basically the same. Carbon-block filters capture very small particles as well as most important chemical compounds that we worry about.</p>
<p>Brita does list certification for VOC removal, which means if you have dissolved solvents and gasses in your water, the Brita is certified to remove most of them. The fact that some filters don&#8217;t list VOC performance isn&#8217;t much of a concern, since it&#8217;s a standard benefit of using a carbon block, but it&#8217;s reassuring that Brita has paid to show what this filter can do.<br />

Brita has all the certificates to show how well this filter works, and the flow switch makes it easy to use at your main kitchen sink. So long as you've got a standard faucet, this is a good choice for on-demand drinking water.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0Pybdfctflt-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<h3>Cost vs. convenience</h3>
<p>The twist-open container designs used on the other filter systems aren&#8217;t difficult to open or close, but Brita&#8217;s design is more compact. These plug-in cartridges have a downside, in that they use slightly more plastic and need to be replaced more frequently.</p>
<p>Also, some users report that mineral build-up can make the seals leak and even prevent the filter from attaching securely. Mineral build-up will ruin any pressurized filter system eventually, so we factored an 18 month replacement cycle into our cost calculation.</p>
<p>Brita will pay for shipping to send in the filters so they can recycle them, but you need to collect the filters for years before you&#8217;d have a full shipment of five pounds.</p>
<p>Unlike the gallon-counting LCD screen on the DuPont, Brita just gives you a bare-bones LED indicator to tell you when to change the filter. We weren&#8217;t able to filter the full 100 gallons on ours before press time, but given that the digital readout on the DuPont wasn&#8217;t accurate, it&#8217;s hard to give either system any extra points.</p>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/faucetfilter_use.mp4.mov" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Another downside, as you can see in this video clip, is that the filter outlet does take a few seconds to empty after each use.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the difference between the Brita and the long-lasting Culligan system worked out to about $11 per year, $52 vs. $41, when we compared average filter prices and estimated replacing the whole system every 18 months. (In worst-case hard-water conditions these systems start to plug up after that long.) That&#8217;s about the same price you&#8217;d pay using a Brita filter pitcher with a Longlast filter.</p>
<p>No matter which faucet filter you choose you&#8217;re adding an obstacle to your sink, but the Brita gives you the most room. It&#8217;s slightly more expensive in the long run, but the replacement filters are also easy to get.</p>
<p>Adding in the extra utility of a second spray pattern with an easy-to-flip selector, the Brita was somewhat more useful for washing dishes as well. When we had to decide on a system we liked using most, this was a pretty easy pick.</p>

<p>If you want maximum filter life and maximum performance, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VZ2LMM/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DuPont &#8211; WWFM350</a> has you covered. The filter included with the FM350 is rated for double the number of gallons that Brita certifies for their filter, though the system costs slightly more overall. In the long run, you could save some money with the DuPont filters.</p>
<p>DuPont also makes this system in a chrome finish, which might go better with your kitchen than Brita&#8217;s white plastic.</p>
<p>Compared to the long list of solvents and organic compounds that Brita has tested their filter against, Dupont lists fewer results overall. They did get their filter certified to remove mercury, however, which is a notable absence on the Brita performance sheet.</p>
<p>There is one quirk about the performance sheet that we found disturbing: The results of the NSF International tests for both DuPont&#8217;s 100-gallon &#8220;extra protection&#8221; filter and the 200-gallon &#8220;ultra protection&#8221; are identical. The ultra protection filter is probably thicker to provide more surface area and last longer. It&#8217;s only a 50-percent price increase for a 100-percent increase in filter life, so it&#8217;s not a rip-off, but the labels imply a bigger difference than there is.</p>

The performance is also certified to be top-class. The system itself is bulky compared to Brita's, though.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VZ2LMMybdfctflt-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>In terms of potential filter performance, let&#8217;s say this again: It would be surprising to see any meaningful difference between these systems we tested. We couldn&#8217;t even pick out anything distinctive about the taste from any of the water samples.</p>
<p>A unique feature of the DuPont is the flow counter: A small LCD screen on the side of the filter holder counts up the number of gallons passing through on the way up to the rated limit of 200. We weren&#8217;t impressed by the accuracy of the counter on the unit we bought: It only showed a few gallons used after the initial &#8220;flush&#8221; indicator went away and we used the filter for a few days of drinking water, making coffee and cooking. When we measured the meter with three gallons of water a week into our test, the digital &#8220;gallons filtered&#8221; display only ticked over after an average of one quart extra was filtered.</p>
<p>The major downfall of the DuPont compared to the Brita was size, though. Even if you don&#8217;t want the extra spray mode the Brita spout provides, the more compact size is a big help. DuPont made their system about 30 percent smaller than the PUR, though, so it&#8217;s not the worst offender.</p>
<p>If the counter had been more accurate or the design had been more compact this could have earned a stronger recommendation, but at the end of the day it&#8217;s just a bulky alternative to the Brita.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007VZ2LMM/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DuPont &#8211; WWFM350</a> filters twice as many gallons as the Brita for a few dollars more per filter.</li>
<li>This is a more expensive system to buy up-front, so this is a longer-term investment.</li>
<li>The gallon counter is kind of nifty, but it&#8217;s a big, clunky filter compared to the Brita.</li>
<li>Comes in imitation nickel, chrome or white plastic finishes.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want the lowest possible up-front investment, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E1FMZ5C/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Culligan&#8217;s FM-100c</a> offers most of the benefits of the other filters for less than $20. It&#8217;s a mid-sized system, a little bit smaller than the DuPont but not as compact as the Brita.</p>
<p>Culligan&#8217;s FM-R filters are rated to last a full 200 gallons like Dupont&#8217;s, but they&#8217;re not as cheap or easy to find. If you have to pay more than the list price for filters, it might be cheaper to replace the whole filter system than to buy a refill. Culligan is still the least-expensive filter system over time, though, if you ever have to replace the whole unit because of a plugged-up switch or leaking seal.</p>
<p>Culligan&#8217;s system is simple. Rather than a knob or paddle switch, you get a spring-loaded plunger that switches flow between filtered and unfiltered spouts. This plunger returns flow to the unfiltered spout when you shut off the water, which is good for conserving your filter. That said, if you&#8217;re filling multiple drinking glasses or water bottles, it&#8217;s annoying that you need to switch it every time you turn off the tap. You&#8217;ll also have to wiggle it sometimes to get the flow entirely to the filter.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we don&#8217;t have any serious problems with the Culligan system, but it feels like every feature winds up being a compromise rather than a benefit.</p>
<p>Even the performance certificate feels like a cost-cutting exercise, with no VOCs tested and only three of the most worrisome compounds listed. It&#8217;s a safe bet that this filter performs almost the same as the others, but it seems the manufacturer wasn&#8217;t invested in showing that. The Culligan did show the lowest amount of dissolved solids in a conductivity test, but it was less than a 10 percent difference.</p>

<p>PUR is one of the biggest filter names in the North American market, nipping at Brita&#8217;s heels. The <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/PUR-Chrome-Horizontal-Faucet-Mount-System-PFM400H/300173955" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PUR &#8211; Advanced PFM400H</a> uses a top-tier carbon-block filter, but the device is just too bulky to win applause from our testers.</p>
<p>Of all the filters we tested, this was the largest. Any lump of chrome-painted plastic on the end of your faucet is going to get in the way to some degree, and we can&#8217;t say that this one was a particular problem, but you won&#8217;t forget it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that PUR hides the size and shape of their filter in the advertising and packaging by only showing it from the side lost them a few points of our esteem.</p>
<p>The flow-diverter switch is the one highlight of this filter: It&#8217;s a big, smooth, easy-to-flip lever. There aren&#8217;t any extra faucet-spray features like Brita has, but it does feel nicer than the other filters in that one regard.</p>
<p>This is the mid-range model from PUR&#8217;s newest lineup, and at about $32, it&#8217;s on the upper end of the range we tested. The filter only lasts for 100 gallons, but they&#8217;re slightly cheaper than the Brita refills. Since the unit itself is so expensive, the real gamble is that the body might plug up with mineral residue and start leaking before you see any benefit from the cheaper filters.</p>
<p>PUR does have a <a href="https://www.target.com/p/pur-ultimate-faucet-filtration-system-with-bluetooth/-/A-50968052" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluetooth-enabled version of this system</a>, but there are almost certainly better ways to track your water intake than a water filter app. It&#8217;s nice to have a definite number for the life of the filter, but we don&#8217;t have much confidence that the flow meter on PUR&#8217;s system would be more accurate than DuPont&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The PUR &#8211; Advanced model we tested does have one premium feature we were eager to try: The RF9999 &#8220;MineralClear&#8221; filters are supposed to add a small amount of dissolved minerals back into your water after it passes through the carbon block.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t really taste a notable improvement, though the water from the PUR system did have about five percent more dissolved minerals than the average. Note that that&#8217;s in a range of 260 to 290 parts per million of dissolved minerals, fairly hard water that was basically unchanged by the other filters. You don&#8217;t have to worry about a faucet mount system taking away all the benign or beneficial minerals the way you do with reverse osmosis or a Zero Water system.</p>
<p>Pur&#8217;s MineralClear filters are certified to take out more contaminants than the other three filters we tested, with basically the same test certifications as DuPont. This is a good filter, but it&#8217;s not obviously doing more than any other carbon filter to give you clean water.</p>

<p>Faucet mount water filters are easy to install and work well. When we&#8217;re testing for our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-water-bottle/">water bottle review</a> and <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-drip-coffee-maker/">coffee maker review</a>, it&#8217;s easy to grow tired of waiting for a pitcher to gravity-filter enough water. Faucet-mounted filters mean on-demand water without giving up any under-sink space for pressure tanks or filter manifolds that come with larger systems.</p>
<p>So long as you have a standard faucet spout with a threaded aerator — and not a pull-out hand-sprayer — any of these filters will install quickly and give you great-tasting water. They all use activated carbon blocks, so the results are similar.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006IV0P/?tag=ybdfctflt-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brita &#8211; FF-100</a> is a clear winner despite the similar-tasting water. The body is compact and keeps mostly out of the way, and the extra spray option might even make this a handy faucet upgrade for some people. It&#8217;s still less expensive to run this filter than to buy Brita&#8217;s pitcher filters, so as long as you don&#8217;t need your water chilled by the fridge, this is a great option.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>We scoured through consumer reviews on Amazon to find out what people like or dislike about the meat slicer they bought and how they use it. Almost everyone cites the expense of buying cold cuts at a deli counter or prepackaged in a supermarket as the reason for purchasing a meat slicer for home. Not only is a meat slicer great for slicing home-roasted meats, but many people also use one for cutting paper-thin slices of meat and then making jerky in a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-food-dehydrator/">food dehydrator like those we reviewed</a>.</p>
<p>Meat slicers for the home are about one-fifth the size of a professional meat slicer, but there are limitations to the size of the meat and cheese you want to slice. For example, all of the slicers we tested could handle a slab of roast beef about 8-inches in length but not more than 4.5-inches thick. So, they’re really not intended for bulk quantities, unless you cut the meat or cheese into several chunks and slice them one at a time.</p>
<p>The meat slicers you find on Amazon and elsewhere have the same 7.5-inch, circular serrated blade. A few larger models are available, but we decided to stick with the regular size with the 7.5-inch blade. The blades for all of the meat slicers we tested were made of stainless steel, which guarantees them a long life without getting dull.</p>

<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p>When you shop for a meat slicer, you’ll notice that they pretty much look identical. Each meat slicer will have a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metal (or metal and plastic) chassis that houses the motor</li>
<li>Circular, serrated blade that fits into a central hub</li>
<li>Adjustable-thickness control knob</li>
<li>Sliding carriage for pushing food through the blade</li>
<li>Safety guard for preventing injury</li>
<li>Non-slip feet</li>
</ul>
<p>The best meat slicers, however, have a few subtle differences that you should look for.</p>
<p><b>Blade lock: </b>The serrated circular blade should lock and unlock into the center hub without your having to touch the blade itself. The blade should have a recessed handle that pops in and out when you’re removing the blade or reinserting it into the hub. A meat slicer’s blade is murderously sharp, and the lock’s handle will prevent your being cut.</p>
<p><b>Blade recess: </b>All slicers have a knob to adjust thickness from zero to 15 millimeters (½ inch). When the knob is at zero, the blade should be completely recessed in its casing; otherwise, it’s easy to nick your fingers when you’re storing the slicer away. Two of the meat slicers we tested had recessed blades when their adjustment knobs were at zero; the other meat slicers did not, so their blades were slightly exposed even at zero.</p>
<p><b>Removable carriage</b>: Bits of food get stuck in between the blade and its casing, so the slicer needs to be thoroughly cleaned after every use. If the carriage is removable, you’ll have better access to safely clean the recesses where food is trapped.</p>

<p>Since slicing meat and cheese is what a meat slicer is intended for, we selected hard salami, roast beef and a semi-soft cheese. Unless its motor is weak (none of the finalists we tested were), it’s relatively easy for a meat slicer to cut thick slices. However, to really make a deli-style sandwich, the meats and cheese should be cut very thin. So for each slicer, we attempted to get a slice at one millimeter, its lowest setting.</p>
<p>We also checked the slicer’s safety features and whether or not it was user-friendly. Finally, after all the slicing, we tested how easy the slicers were to clean and store away.</p>

<p>Not only does the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IW22Z6E/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; FS-75</a> cut tissue-paper-thin slices, it also has several safety and ergonomic features that none of the other meat slicers we tested has.</p>
<p>If you’ve never worked with a meat slicer before, it may be a bit intimidating at first. The circular blade looks like a mini buzzsaw, and it really is as sharp as it looks. So it was reassuring that when we unpacked the Cuisinart, its blade was completely recessed into the blade’s casing. The Cuisinart’s slice control knob is set at a true zero, which guarantees practically zero chance of injury when you&#8217;re storing it.</p>
<p>The knob is also ergonomically designed. Its unusual comma shape does two things. First, your thumb fits into the curve, which allows for a precise adjustment of cut size. Also, the knob moves <i>away </i>from the blade — rather than towards it, like most of the other slicers’ knobs do — so it’s safe as well.</p>
<p>Performance was excellent. We experimented with the thinnest setting, and the cheese and salami were sliced as perfectly as you’d see on a restaurant’s charcuterie board. The roast beef shredded a bit, so we increased the cut size to the next thickness (1/16 inch), and it stayed intact.</p>

Ergonomically designed with safety features to prevent injury that most of the other slicers we tested didn’t have, the Cuisinart handily made our top pick.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IW22Z6E/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>Clean-up of any meat slicer is always a pain, but it’s easier with the Cuisinart. It’s the only slicer with a removable carriage, which pops out and back in, and allows you to clean crevices underneath. The Cuisinart also has a nifty recessed handle in the center of the blade. You push a button, and a small handle pops out, which then allows you to lift out the blade without touching its edges.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart is about the same price as the other slicers we tested. We found it to be the easiest to operate, and with the thoughtful design and safety features, we recommend the Cuisinart as the best meat slicer.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuisinart &#8211; FS-75 consistently sliced razor-thin meats and cheese for deli-style sandwiches or a gourmet charcuterie board at home.</li>
<li>Its additional safety features protect fingers and hands from the blade.</li>
<li>With its removable sliding carriage, the Cuisinart was the easiest to clean.</li>
<li>The Cuisinart is similarly priced to other meat slicers, but it&#8217;s better made.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UDN75QQ/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arksen &#8211; A-048-GM-48087</a> meat slicer performed almost as well as the Cuisinart. It’s also the only other slicer we tested that had a true-zero adjustment setting, so the blade is recessed in its casing. Similar to the Cuisinart, the Arksen has a curved adjustment knob that turns away from the blade. Initially we found the knob stiff to turn, but after repeated use, it was easier to adjust.</p>
<p>The Arksen sliced everything very well, but it was particularly good with cheese. At its lowest setting, it sliced cheese so thinly and evenly, the slice was transparent when we held it up to the light. Salami was also sliced paper-thin. The roast beef didn’t slice quite as thinly, but when we increased the thickness to the next level (1/16 inch), the slices came out evenly cut.</p>
<div class="amazonpip ybdinsert columns-12"><div class="rank_title"></div><div class="amazon-image-wrapper loop1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UDN75QQ/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank"><img class=" " data-src="" data-srcset="" width="" height="" sizes="150px" /></a></div><div class="apip-info"><h3>Best for Cheese Boards: Arksen</h3><p>The Arksen slices meats very thinly, but it really excels in evenly slicing cheese at varying thicknesses, which makes it ideal for a cheese board of hard and semi-soft cheeses.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UDN75QQ/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The only thing we didn’t like about the Arksen is, like the other slicers — except the Cuisinart — a viscous white lubricant has been injected into the blade casing to keep the blade running smoothly. Instructions state that the (hopefully food-grade) lubricant should not be washed off. But it&#8217;s unavoidable when you need to properly clean the blade, and the lubricant smears both the inner and outer sides of the blade with a greasy film that’s difficult to remove.</p>
<p>The Arksen frequently makes “best of” lists, and we can see why. It’s a well-crafted slicer that’s lightweight, user-friendly and affordable.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Arksen &#8211; A-048-GM-48087 can slice just about everything at the thinnest cut.</li>
<li>It has a couple of the safety features that our top pick Cuisinart has for protecting fingers and hands from getting nicked by the sharp blade.</li>
<li>The lubricant in the blade casing tends to smear when you’re trying to clean the blade.</li>

<h3>Gourmia &#8211; GFS700</h3>
<p>It took some trial and error to get an even slice out of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017HX1D8K/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gourmia &#8211; GFS700</a>. The thickness-adjustment knob, which needs to be turned <i>toward</i> the blade rather than away, doesn’t have the accuracy that the Cuisinart and Arksen had. The salami sliced well, but we couldn’t get the cheese to slice thinner than 1/16-inch without falling apart. Roast beef shredded until we increased the thickness to ¼-inch.</p>
<p>Removal and reinsertion of the blade was also challenging. The blade connects to the hub with a plastic screw. Once it was removed, we had to pry the blade out of the casing, increasing the chances of injury. To put the blade back into the casing, the plastic screw needed to be perfectly aligned or the blade jammed.</p>
<h3>Chefman &#8211; RJ49-CA</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CT5TVTX/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chefman &#8211; RJ49-CA</a>’s chassis and casing are made of die-cast metal, so it looks and feels like it’s well-constructed. The Chefman has an almost identical blade and blade lock as the Cuisinart, but that’s where the favorable comparison ends. The Chefman doesn’t have a true-zero setting, so the blade is always exposed in storage. The markings on the adjustment knob are in a reverse direction, so we couldn’t see what thickness we adjusted it to, which means we had to eyeball the thickness as we sliced. Even when we set the Chefman to the thinnest cut, it sliced everything too thick.</p>
<h3>Elite Platinum &#8211; EMT-625B</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D7TFTVN/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elite Platinum &#8211; EMT-625B</a> was certainly the loudest slicer we tested, and if you’re bothered by the sound of a buzzsaw, this slicer isn’t for you. Although it has the Cuisinart’s blade lock, the Elite has the same problems as the Chefman: greasy lubricant in the blade casing and on the blade, adjustment settings in reverse and difficulty in getting a thickness less than ¼-inch.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>If you crave a deli sandwich and don’t want to fuss slicing meat and cheese with a knife, then a meat slicer will save you time, frustration and money. A meat slicer is also great for thinly slicing vegetables, and if you’re a fan of a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-bread-machine/">bread machine</a>, many consumers even slice perfect slices of home-made bread with one.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IW22Z6E/?tag=ybddeli-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; FS-75</a> is about the same price as the other meat slicers we tested, but it was the easiest to use and consistently cut even and super-thin slices of meat and cheese. Added to its excellent performance are the safety features that help prevent injury from the efficient, razor-sharp blade.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>Nonstick pans are incredibly popular, but their composition and nonstick coating are controversial. Since nonstick pans are made of hardened aluminum and painted with several layers of nonstick coating, we read opinions and reviews that argued for and against using nonstick cookware.</p>
<p>To no one’s surprise, the majority of pro-nonstick websites we consulted are dedicated to cooking, such as Epicurious, Bon Appetit, The Food Network and Cook’s Illustrated. Their reviews of nonstick pans avoid entirely the health issues that are possibly linked to aluminum pans and nonstick coatings. In fact, they focus instead on the health benefits of using nonstick pans, because you don’t need to add oils and fats except as a flavoring.</p>
<p>Research into whether using nonstick pans is linked to health issues is ongoing. We did learn, however, of certain precautions you should take, which we followed during our testing.</p>
<p>We moved on to subreddits /r/cooking and /r/askculinary for opinions about the best nonstick pans and compared them to hundreds of Amazon reviews. We then culled together a list of the nonstick pans that were considered the best by experts and consumers alike. We had already reviewed <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/">the best nonstick cookware</a>, so we turned our attention to 10-inch skillets, which most chefs agree are the right size and weight for cooking several eggs or pancakes at one time.</p>
<p>Because there are a variety of heating elements in today’s kitchens, we narrowed our selection to nonstick pans that are designed for use on gas, electric and induction cooktops. Not all of the nonstick pans we wanted to test are sold individually, so we also decided to test nonstick-pan sets that included a 10-inch skillet along with a smaller or larger pan.</p>
<p>Even properly cared for, nonstick coating doesn&#8217;t hold up longer than two years. There&#8217;s really no reason to spend a lot on a nonstick pan if you&#8217;re going to have to replace it. So we selected nonstick pans that were $40 or less.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs a nonstick pan?</h2>
<p>Nonstick pans have been in use since the 1950s, and if you’re a cook, it’s a pretty safe bet that you’ve cooked with one or two in your lifetime. If you’ve been using a nonstick pan for a while, it’s also quite likely that it looks like it’s been through a war; it’s scratched, peeling, warped, banged up and you need to slather it up with butter to keep food from sticking.</p>
<p>We’ve been using nonstick pans for many years, and we’ve been cooking everything, at all levels of heat, in them. Little did we know that a nonstick pan was not designed for cooking all kinds of food. How often have you preheated a nonstick pan on high and seared a ribeye or salmon steak? If you’re like us, countless times, and that’s a surefire way of diminishing the lifespan of a nonstick fry pan.</p>
<p>You’re actually quite limited as to what you can cook in a nonstick pan. Steaks, sautes, stir fries — anything that needs high heat — should be cooked in a cast-iron skillet or stainless-steel saute pan. With both of these pans you want stuff to stick, because those browned bits (also called <i>fond </i>) can be whisked into a flavorful gravy or sauce.</p>
<p>Most nonstick pans are made from hardened aluminum, which has excellent heat conductivity, so they need less heat to cook food. Nonstick pans are thus ideal for delicate food that cooks quickly, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fried eggs</li>
<li>Scrambled eggs</li>
<li>Omelettes</li>
<li>Pancakes or crepes</li>
<li>Delicate fish filets, such as sole or flounder</li>
</ul>
<p>Every home cook should have at least one nonstick pan in the kitchen cabinet for this type of gentle, rapid cooking. If you’re looking to switch out your old pots and pans for new ones, our review of the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/">best nonstick cookware</a> includes saucepans, stock pots and saute pans.</p>
<h2 id="what-is">What is nonstick coating?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, nonstick coatings are made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), otherwise known as the famous (and infamous) brand name Teflon. It’s a paint that’s sprayed on the pan usually in three coats. The pan is then heat-cured to make sure the coating stays intact.</p>
<p>Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was a chemical commonly used for spraying the PTFE coats evenly. Although PFOA was initially deemed safe for home cooks using the pan, it did have harmful effects on the health of people working near or at the facility where the pan was manufactured and the PFOA applied.</p>
<p>In 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency linked perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) to a number of health issues, including cancer, and urged manufacturers to cease using PFOA by 2015. Since 2013, most companies have complied. All of the nonstick pans we tested were PFOA-free.</p>
<h3>Is nonstick coating safe?</h3>
<p>As we discussed in detail in our review of <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-nonstick-cookware/#what-is-it">nonstick cookware</a> about safety concerns, nonstick coatings can be harmful if the pan is improperly used. If an empty nonstick pan is left on an open flame long enough and heats to 662 ºF or higher, the PTFE begins to disintegrate. In those conditions, fine particles and noxious gasses are released and, if inhaled, can cause severe internal issues.</p>
<p>This off-gassing is particularly harmful — if not fatal — to birds, so many manufacturers now label packaging with a warning about using a nonstick pan in the vicinity of pet birds or parrots.</p>
<p>Nonstick coatings are generally considered safe if you follow these precautions:</p>
<p><b>Don’t preheat an empty pan:</b> Most nonstick pans are made of heavy aluminum, which can hit the 662ºF danger point in a few minutes. Always have food or liquid in the pan, and keep it moving as it cooks.</p>
<p><b>Cook at medium or medium-low heat: </b>Nonstick pans are designed to distribute heat evenly, so you don’t need to crank up the heat past medium for food to cook.</p>
<p><b>Ventilate your kitchen: </b>Whether you use your stove’s ventilator or simply open a window, keep the air flowing while you cook. You could also run an air purifier, like the one <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-air-purifier/">we recommend in our best air purifier review</a>, in your kitchen.</p>
<h2>How to take care of a nonstick pan</h2>
<p>Many complaints on Amazon about nonstick pans are that the nonstick coating scratches and flakes and stops working so that everything cooked sticks. People are also confused by the term “lifetime warranty” and try to return the pan a year after they purchased it.</p>
<p>Lifetime warranty is a vague term used by manufacturers to sell their product. It doesn&#8217;t mean that a nonstick pan will last the lifetime of the owner, nor does it refer to the pan&#8217;s lifetime, since that&#8217;s impossible to calculate.</p>
<p>A nonstick pan may hold up for 10 or 15 years, but the nonstick coating itself won&#8217;t last more than two years. There are a few best practices, however, you can follow that will help the nonstick coating last as long as possible.</p>
<p><b>Never use metal utensils with your nonstick cookware: </b>Although several manufacturers claim their nonstick pan is scratch-proof, take it with a grain of salt. Only use wood or silicone utensils.</p>
<p><b>Don’t shock the pan in water: </b>Any heavy-duty pan will warp from rapid change in temperature. After you’re done cooking, let the pan cool down before washing it.</p>
<p><b>Clean your pan with a scratch-proof pad or sponge: </b>Nonstick coatings are sensitive to steel wool, scouring pads and abrasive powder. Instead, use a nonscratch sponge like the one we recommend in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-kitchen-cleaning-sponge/#the-best-scratch">review of the best kitchen cleaning sponges</a>.</p>
<p><b>Wash and dry the pan by hand: </b>Ignore the manufacturer’s claim that its nonstick pan is “dishwasher-safe.” Abrasive detergent powder and heat will damage the pan’s nonstick coating in no time. All of the nonstick pans we tested were easily wiped clean with a paper towel or damp sponge. Dry the pan by hand to keep rust from forming.</p>
<p><b>Never use an aerosol cooking spray: </b>Cooking-oil sprays burn at a lower temperature than oil, and their burnt-on residue is almost impossible to remove without using a scouring pad.</p>
<p><b>Store your pans properly: </b>Hang your pans, or store them in dividers in your cabinet. If you don’t have the space in your kitchen and need to stack your pans, line the interior and edges with microfiber cloths or <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-paper-towels/">paper towels</a>.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Flat, smooth surface: </b>Some nonstick pans have a convex surface — a slight dome in the center — which allows the pan’s metal base to expand as it heats and prevents warping. One of the most common criticisms of nonstick pans is that convex surfaces cause runny foods, such as eggs or pancake batter, to dribble down the center of the pan and into the pan’s sides. So you want a pan that has a smooth, almost slick, surface and flat bottom, which sits evenly on your cooktop.</p>
<p><b>Size:</b> Nonstick pans range in size from eight inches to 12.5 inches. If you want to cook an omelette or more than two eggs or pancakes at one time, we recommend a 10-inch pan. The 10-inch pan gives you enough room to flip eggs or pancakes. The larger pans certainly accommodate more food, but you’ll need a larger heating element to properly heat the entire pan.</p>
<p><b>Weight and grip: </b>How much a pan should weigh and how you want it to fit in your hand are completely subjective choices. But we recommend that a pan should be light enough to flip an omelette or — if you’re skilled or daring — a sunny-side-up egg with a couple of quick flicks with your wrist. Almost all of the 10-inch pans we tested weighed under two pounds, which is light enough to easily maneuver the pan. The Tramontina was a few ounces heavier, and it was more difficult to move the pan around.</p>
<p><b>Shape: </b>The best 10-inch nonstick pans are French skillets, which have a flat, smooth bottom and low, flared sides that give you easy access for flipping eggs, pancakes or fish.</p>
<p><b>Handle: </b>A French skillet has a long handle that’s slightly shorter than the diameter of the pan. This length allows you to flip food with a quick jerking motion of your wrist and elbow. The handle should either have a silicone covering (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon Advanced</a>) or be made of stainless steel (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PCI71TS/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips</a>) to protect your hand from the intense heat generated by the pan.</p>
<p><b>Price: </b>Some beautiful nonstick pans are available with high price tags; they’re not worth it. When the nonstick coating stops working (and it will), you’ll feel less pain replacing a $40 pan than you would an expensive one.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>

<h3>Heat distribution</h3>
<p>We dusted flour over the bottom of each pan and turned the heat on low. As the flour browned we could tell how evenly the pan heated up. If the flour browned at the same time from center to edge, heat distribution was good. Only two of the finalists — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B55RQBO/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Circulon </a> — browned the flour evenly. The other pans browned from the center and then radiated out to the edges or browned in spots.</p>
<h3>Fried eggs</h3>
<p>Most people who purchase a nonstick pan want to cook without oil. Because we wanted to test whether a pan’s coating was truly nonstick, we didn&#8217;t use oil in any of our cooking tests. Once the pan was heated, we cracked an egg in the center of the pan and another on the side furthest from the handle.</p>
<p>When the egg whites firmed up, we turned them over and noted any sticking. Finally, we attempted to shake the pan to release the eggs; if this failed, we gently eased the eggs out of the pan and again noted how much they stuck.</p>
<h3>Scrambled eggs</h3>

<p>We whisked two eggs together and poured them into the pan. We immediately began moving them with a silicone spatula from the edges to the center. Because the eggs were in constant motion, most of the pans performed well. We had the most trouble with the Circulon, since the concentric circles trapped and browned the eggs between the ridges.</p>
<h3>Pancakes</h3>

<p>We used this <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic recipe for pancakes</a> and poured circles of batter into the pan: one in the center, one close to the handle and two on the opposite side of the handle. We noted whether the center pancake cooked faster than the pancakes near the handle and sides of the pan. We also attempted to flip the pancakes without using a spatula. Only if the pancake stuck did we use a silicone spatula to release them from the pan.</p>
<h3>Filet of sole</h3>
<p>We wanted a very delicate fish that could easily stick and fall apart. We put a thin three-ounce filet of sole into the pan for 30 seconds and then attempted to turn it over. This test proved to be the tell-all, as the fish stuck slightly or a lot to some pans and broke into pieces as we turned it over.</p>
<p>Two pans, however, were the clear champs: our top pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon</a>, and our top pick for a nonstick-pan set, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IKMR96/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Classic</a>. Both pans lightly browned the fish and were 100-percent nonstick. We turned the fish, and the filets were left intact.</p>

<p>We found cooking with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon &#8211; 82074 Advanced</a> a pleasure. It&#8217;s 100-percent nonstick, and the 10-inch skillet was one of the lightest that we tested, so flipping eggs and pancakes was as effortless as Julia Child made it look.</p>
<p>The Anolon &#8211; Advanced is composed of anodized aluminum, which means it’s been manufactured with an electrochemical process that hardens the aluminum and makes it extra durable. It’s triple-coated with Autograph 2, a top-of-the-line Teflon derivative from Dupont&#8217;s spin-off company Chemours.</p>
<p>The Anolon has low sides and a smooth, flat surface, so it sat completely flat on our cooktop. It has excellent conductivity and was one of the fastest of the pans to heat up — in a mere 15 seconds — at medium-low. Hovering our hands over the pan, we could feel the heat radiating upward over the entire pan.</p>
<p>We cracked the eggs in the center and side, and both cooked at exactly the same rate. Thanks to the Anolon’s entirely flat surface, the eggs didn’t move, giving us the ideal bulls-eye shape. We turned the eggs over, and when the yolk was cooked (in about five seconds), we gently shook the pan, and the egg easily slid onto a plate in a compact package.</p>

<p>Everything cooked in a flash. Scrambled eggs came together in about 30 seconds and slid off onto the plate. Pancakes were golden brown in seconds. Again, we simply shook the pan, and the pancakes released. The sole filet was perfect: lightly browned, and since none of it stuck to the pan, we could lift and serve the filet intact.</p>
<p>The 8-inch handle is covered in silicone, which is easy to grip, and protects your hand from the pan’s intense heat.  The Anolon was ridiculously easy to clean; once it had cooled, we simply wiped it with a paper towel in between tests and washed it with a damp sponge when we were done.</p>
<p>The 10-inch skillet is sold separately and as a set with a 12-inch skillet. The larger pan performed exactly the same, but because its handle is too short, we found it less easy to maneuver on and off the stove top.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s actually much cheaper to buy the set than it is to buy the 10-inch skillet separately.  Because of the larger pan&#8217;s slight design flaw, we can&#8217;t recommend the Anolon as a set. But the 10-inch skillet outperformed all other finalists, and so, by itself, the Anolon 10-inch skillet is the best nonstick pan.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag=ybdnspan-20">Anolon &#8211; 82074 Advanced</a> 10-inch French skillet has a smooth, flat surface with three coats of high-end nonstick coating that makes it truly 100-percent nonstick.</li>
<li>With a simple shake of the pan, everything we cooked slid right out and onto a plate.</li>
<li>The Anolon has superb conductivity and heat distribution and cooked the fastest and most evenly of all the nonstick pans we tested.</li>
<li>With a simple wipe of a paper towel or damp sponge, the Anolon is a cinch to clean.</li>

<p>Cuisinart really stepped up their game with their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IKMR96/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; 722-911NS Chef&#8217;s Classic</a> nonstick pan set. This high-end — but affordable — set includes a 9-inch skillet and an 11-inch skillet. Their stainless-steel, stay-cool handles are the appropriate length for the dimensions of the pans, which makes them both feel well balanced— unlike Anolon&#8217;s larger pan — and easy to maneuver.</p>
<p>The Cuisinart pans are triple-coated with a Teflon derivative called QuanTanium. Each QuanTanium layer is reinforced with titanium and ceramic particles, which Cuisinart claims give the pans maximum protection from wear and tear.</p>
<p>Visually, the Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Classic pans are stunners. Their glossy, mirror finish on the exterior has a professional look, and if you have the room for it, you would feel compelled to hang them over your stove.</p>
<p>Looks aren’t everything, of course, and the Cuisinart’s performance was on par with the Anolon. The pans&#8217; conductivity and heat distribution weren&#8217;t quite as good as the Anolon, since it took nearly a minute for them to fully heat, and the flour browned quicker in the bottom two-thirds of the pan.</p>
<p>When we cracked the eggs into the center and upper third of the pan, however, they cooked exactly the same in a minute. The cooked eggs released onto a plate with just a gentle shake.</p>

<p>On the negative side, the Cuisinart pans have a slightly convex surface, so egg white dribbled down into the sides of each pan.  Scrambled eggs also ran a bit into this gutter. However, though we had to move the eggs out of the sides, they cooked evenly and slid out onto a plate.</p>
<p>Cleaning was easy, and although the mirror glaze did not discolor from the high heat, we did notice a couple of slight spots on the bottom of the pan, which we scrubbed off. The Chef’s Classic pans are dishwasher safe, but Cuisinart does state that the pans will eventually lose their mirror finish with repeated dishwasher cleaning.</p>
<p>Cuisinart only sells the 9-inch and 11-inch pans as a set. The Chef’s Classic are so well-priced for such high-quality nonstick pans, you’re really getting two great pans for the price of one.</p>
<p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>With the glossy, mirror finish, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IKMR96/?tag=ybdnspan-20">Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Classic</a> pan set is not only beautiful but is completely nonstick as well.</li>
<li>The skillets took longer to heat up than our top pick, but they performed just as well.</li>
<li>The well-price set includes a 9-inch pan and an 11-inch pan, which you can’t buy separately.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0170TFNXM/?tag=ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">All Clad &#8211; E785S264</a> nonstick pan set includes an 8-inch skillet and a 10-inch skillet. Both are similar in construction to the Anolon, but the All Clad pans are designed like classic saute pans: Low, straight sides and long handles. These features allow for searing meat and making pan sauces, but those tasks are more appropriate for a cast-iron skillet or stainless-steel pan.</p>
<p>The All Clad pans have convex surfaces, so the eggs and pancake batter ran into the side gutters and cooked too quickly. The pans’ nonstick coating was actually quite effective, however, and although the fish filet stuck slightly, it released without falling apart.</p>
<p>Both pans cleaned easily, but we did notice that food particles got stuck in between the pan and the rivets that connected the handle to the pan.</p>
<p>The All Clad is substantially more expensive than the Cuisinart set, which we believe to be better pans at a better price.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PCI71TS/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Nonstick Pro Fry Pan</a> is a nicely constructed and well-balanced 10-inch skillet. It feels substantial in the hand yet also easy to maneuver. The stay-cool metal handle is contoured for a comfortable grip.</p>
<p>OXO markets their proprietary nonstick coating as German-engineered and PFOA-free. With some research, we learned that there are indeed German-engineered nonstick pans, and some may use ceramic or other non-PTFE materials, but OXO’s nonstick pans still have a Teflon-like coating.</p>
<p>OXO’s nonstick coating, however, isn’t really as effective as OXO makes it out to be. The pan’s heat distribution seemed off: The half closest to the handle was hotter than the opposite half. Everything cooked faster on the handle side so food stuck: It wasn’t a lot of sticking, but just enough that egg and fish wouldn’t release from the pan without prying them free.</p>
<p>OXO charges more for their kitchen tools and appliances, which are usually excellent. In this case, however we don’t feel that this nonstick pan’s performance merits its high price.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CY3MRDS/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Calphalon -1943286 Classic Fry Pan</a> is a well-made, anodized aluminum 10-inch pan with a dual nonstick coating. All of the other pans we tested had three layers, and since Calphalon is perhaps one of the most recognized companies for nonstick cookware, it seems odd for this pan to have only two coatings. Calphalon makes its own nonstick coating, which is PTFE-based — basically, it’s Teflon — but it did not perform better than other similar coatings.</p>
<p>Heat distribution originated from the center of the pan and radiated outward, so everything we cooked on the edges browned less. The Calphalon took longer to heat up, but once it did, it was blistering hot, and food stuck. The pan has a stainless-steel handle, which should be cool, but the one-third of the handle connected to the pan was too hot to touch.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B55RQBO/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Circulon &#8211; 87507 Symmetry French Skillet</a> set includes a 9-inch pan and an 11-inch pan. Both have a silicone-encased 8-inch handle, which is too short for the larger and substantially heavier pan.</p>
<p>Like all Circulon pans, the Symmetry French Skillet has raised circular ridges on its surface that the manufacturer claims help release food from the pan. However, in all of our tests, everything — except for the pancakes — stuck in between the ridges.</p>
<p>The Circulon had even heat induction and distribution, so the entire surface of the pan heated at the same time. We had success with the pancakes, which were easy to flip, but the fish stuck and fell apart when we tried to turn it. The circular ridges were most annoying with the fried and scrambled eggs, which got stuck between the grooves and browned too fast.</p>
<p>Cleaning was also a challenge. The sides of the pan wiped clean with a paper towel, but we had to scrape out the food bits trapped inside the ridges.</p>
<h3>Tramontina &#8211; Professional Restaurant Fry Pan</h3>

<p>We were excited to try out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009HBKQ16/?tag=ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tramontina 10-inch skillet</a>, which was recommended by Wirecutter as the best nonstick pan. After testing the Tramontina, however, we were left scratching our heads wondering why Wirecutter praised it so highly.</p>
<p>It’s certainly a well-designed skillet, made of heavy-gauge aluminum and a long stainless-steel handle that’s further protected by a silicone sheath. At two pounds, however, the Tramontina was the heaviest of the 10-inch skillets we tested and difficult to maneuver.</p>
<p>Tramontina’s directions suggested massaging the pan with a little vegetable oil before cooking, but it didn’t do a thing; eggs, pancakes, fish and even the flour stuck.</p>
<p>It took somewhat more effort to clean the Tramontina, and the pretty-but-unprotected satin exterior finish on the bottom of the pan began to discolor during our test period. The Tramontina is reasonably priced, but its performance did nothing to win us over.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Competition is fierce for luring consumers to purchase pans that are purportedly “100-percent” or “totally” nonstick. We discovered from our testing, however, that many nonstick pans simply don’t work, unless you slather them with butter and oil, which completely defeats their purpose.</p>
<p>The best nonstick pan has a smooth, flat surface, a long handle either made from stainless steel or encased in silicone and even distribution of heat across the entire pan. The best nonstick pan, by far, is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1CJME/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anolon Advanced</a>.</p>
<p>In every test, everything we cooked on the Anolon Advanced was easily released by a simple shake of the pan, thanks to its high-quality nonstick coating. It has superb heat distribution to cook food evenly and quickly. The Anolon Advanced is dishwasher-safe, but it wipes clean in seconds with a paper towel or damp sponge, so there’s no need to risk damaging the pan’s nonstick coating in the dishwasher.</p>
<p>The best nonstick pan set is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IKMR96/?tag= ybdnspan-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuisinart &#8211; Chef’s Classic</a>, which includes a 9-inch skillet and an 11-inch skillet. The pans have a beautiful mirror finish and look like chef’s pans you might see in a fancy restaurant. The Cuisinart pans were also perfectly nonstick and easy to clean. They’re very reasonably priced — we’d even say budget-priced — for such high-quality pans.</p>

<h2 id="how-selected">How we selected finalists to test</h2>
<p>There are literally hundreds of food storage containers that you could buy online and at practically any store. There’s a very good chance that you’ve got cabinets, drawers and pantries stuffed with them and that they’re stained, warped and damaged from microwaving leftovers. You probably want to throw them out, but what do you buy as replacements?</p>
<p>To narrow our selection, we started by reading customer reviews on Amazon. The reviews pointed us in the direction of food storage containers that stand up to years of heating and reheating, radical changes in temperature and dishwashing.</p>
<p>We also checked out reviews from reputable cooking websites and recommendations from health and diet websites. Parents of schoolchildren had lots of opinions about which containers are best for school lunches, as did people who do weekly meal prep dietary or workout regimen.</p>
<p>Finally we divided our finalists into those that were plastic and those that were glass — five of each — since the number of consumers who prefer one to the other is about equal.</p>
<p>Although glass containers last longer than plastic containers, glass containers are also prone to chip, particularly around the edges where the top snaps on. There are also complaints that glass containers can explode in the oven. We had some highly rated glass containers on our list, but we eliminated those that tended to chip and shatter.</p>

<h2 id="who-needs">Who needs food storage containers?</h2>
<p>There’s a wide variety of uses for food storage containers. Whether you cook for yourself or a family brood, you may have leftovers you wish to enjoy the next day. Other people cook in bulk and freeze food for a month or longer. In both cases, you need a storage container that is airtight and leak proof so it will keep food fresh and, if frozen, frost-free.</p>
<p>It’s also important for some people that the container can be removed from the refrigerator or freezer and go directly into the oven. In this case, the container must be borosilicate glass that can withstand high heat without shattering.</p>
<p>Pot-luck dinners are popular in many communities, so a large, sturdy container with a secure lid is ideal for transportation. Parents of school children pack their lunches in food storage containers to be carried in backpacks. In this case, it’s important that the container be leak-proof, since its contents can easily shift sideways or upside down.</p>
<p>Meal prep containers are food storage containers in specific amounts for people who are dieting or on a workout regimen. Oftentimes, meal prep containers are divided in half to apportion two types of food in a single container.</p>
<p>Food storage containers aren’t just for food; people who do their own home repair use them for storing various sizes of screws, bolts, nails and other hardware.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health concerns about using plastic</h2>
<p>You’re probably aware of two chemicals associated with plastic containers: BPA and phthalates. BPA (Bisphenol A) is a chemical used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastic, which is the type of plastic used in most food containers.</p>
<p>When heated in a microwave, BPA leeches into the food or liquid, and although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated the low levels of BPA are safe, research suggests there are possible health effects on the brain and behavior of infants and children.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/sya-bpa/index.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The National Institute of Environmental Sciences recommends</a> avoiding products that are not labeled BPA-free and not microwaving products made of polycarbonate plastic.</p>
<p>Phthalates are chemicals used to make plastic pliable. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Phthalates_FactSheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state</a> that although phthalates have affected the reproductive system of lab animals, research continues as to how phthalates affect humans.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use plastic food containers, buy those that are labeled “BPA-free” and “Phthalate-free.” However, additional research is being conducted about whether such products are actually harmful as well.</p>
<h2 id="features">Important features to consider</h2>
<p><b>Plastic vs. glass: </b>Both have pros and cons. Plastic containers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, large and small, and they’re lightweight, so you can carry them in a backpack or shoulder bag. If they’re leakproof and airtight, food and liquids won’t spill out if the container is dropped or accidentally turned upside down or sideways.</p>
<p>Plastic containers are also significantly cheaper than glass containers. For $20, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSKSG1M/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids</a> comes with 24 various sizes of containers and lids.</p>
<p>The downside to plastic containers is that they simply don’t last. Mostly everyone microwaves food in a plastic container and then tosses it into the dishwasher. After our testing, all of the plastic containers were stained to some extent, and most were pitted and scratched.</p>
<p>Glass food storage containers are heavier and more expensive. However, they’re also far more durable than plastic and much easier to clean. If you’re concerned about BPAs and phthalates, you can rest assured that a glass container is healthier. All of the glass containers we tested had plastic lids, so these should not be microwaved or run through the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re ecologically mindful, glass is one of the best options.</p>
<p><b>Silicone gasket:</b> Many of the food storage containers we tested had a silicone gasket inserted into the inner lip of the lid where it connects to the top of the container. When the lid is locked into place, the silicone gasket forms a tight seal.</p>
<p>Our two winners — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; Smart Seal</a> — had gaskets that were twice as thick as the other finalists, so their lids floated on top of the containers. When the latches are locked, a vacuum seal is created, thus ensuring both were leakproof and airtight.</p>
<p>Food particles can get trapped between the gasket and the lid’s lip, and silicone tends to retain food odors and must be periodically soaked in a vinegar-water solution. You’ll want a silicone gasket that can be removed for cleaning and easily reinserted.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO &#8211; Smart Seal</a> was, by far, the easiest silicone gasket to remove. The lid has side tabs that allow you to pull out the gasket and then snap it back on. (In fact, its design reminded us of the Instant Pot, which we loved in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-pressure-cooker/">review of the best pressure cookers</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Stacking/Nesting: </b>Whether you have a big or small kitchen, ample cabinet or drawer space is a premium. Glass food storage containers aren’t great for stacking or nesting, because sometimes a smaller container gets stuck in a larger one. Many plastic containers are designed for nesting, but you run into trouble with all of the bothersome lids.</p>
<p>Of the containers we tested, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSKSG1M/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids</a> were the easiest to nest, and their interlocking lids prevent your rummaging around the bottom of drawer trying to find the right size.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<h3>Leaks</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/testing-leakproof.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>We filled each container two-thirds full with water and secured the lid. Then we vigorously shook each container for one minute over paper towels and noted any leaks. Almost all of the manufacturers advertised their container as leakproof, and for the most part, they were. The Pyrex and Sistema don’t claim to be leakproof, and they weren’t; water leaked from their corners. But Prep Naturals was supposed to be leakproof, and water also poured out.</p>
<h3>Airtight seals</h3>
<p>Airtight containers hold in moisture and keep out odors from other foods in the refrigerator.  For this test we made sure that each container was completely dry. Then we placed one sheet of toilet tissue into the bottom of the container and sealed it. Next, we filled a three-gallon bucket with water colored with food dye and plunged each container one at a time into the bucket, holding it under for one minute. After that, we flipped the container upside down and submerged it for another minute. We then withdrew the container from the bucket, unsealed the lid and noted whether the toilet tissue was wet or dry.</p>
<p>All of the manufacturers claimed their containers were airtight. Not surprisingly, the same three that were not leakproof — Pyrex, Sistema and Prep Naturals — were also not airtight.</p>
<h3>Lid sealing</h3>
<p>The majority of food storage containers that we tested were sealed by aligning a silicone gasket inside the lid with the edge of the container, then locking it with hinged latches on all four sides. Four exceptions were the Pyrex and the Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids, which simply had snap-on lids, and the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance and Sistema, both of which had two latches on the longer sides of the container.</p>
<p>We tested the lids and latches by opening them and closing them repeatedly and noted whether or not they were easy to snap on and release.</p>
<h3>Staining</h3>
<p>Plastic food containers are notorious for being stained by tomato-based foods, such as spaghetti sauce, and curries with turmeric. We began this test by filling each container three-quarters full with marinara and then froze them overnight in the freezer. The next day, we defrosted the containers with lids askew in the microwave until the marinara was boiling. When the sauce had been completely defrosted, we allowed each container to fully cool before dumping the marinara out.</p>
<p>As expected, all of the plastic containers and their lids were stained. The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance, however, was only slightly stained.

<p>After we microwaved the frozen marinara in the plastic containers, we checked each one over for signs of warping. None were affected by the long microwaving. Two glass containers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N90AWNF/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1790</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LN7X92K/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glasslock</a>, warned to not microwave their plastic lids. Since their lids were exactly the same as the other glass containers, we ignored the dire warning. Other than staining, neither were affected by the microwave.</p>

<p>If you read consumer reviews online, you’ll see some terrifying photos of glass food storage containers that have exploded in the oven. Borosilicate glass is resistant to sudden high changes of temperature, because it doesn’t expand like regular glass.</p>
<p>Still, all manufacturers advise putting borosilicate glass containers — especially from the refrigerator or freezer — into a preheated oven. This seems to defy logic, but when a glass container is put into a cold oven and then the heat is turned on, the heating element initially radiates heat unevenly, which doesn&#8217;t allow the glass to expand properly and will cause it to crack or shatter.</p>
<p>For our test, we removed the plastic lids from each glass container filled with frozen marinara and put the containers into a preheated 350℉ oven. All of the glass containers reheated the marinara in the same amount of time, and none shattered.</p>

<p>The dishwasher undoubtedly does the most damage to plastic food containers and lids. We followed manufacturer instructions and loaded the glass containers into the lower part of the dishwasher and the plastic containers and all the lids into the upper rack. We then set the dishwasher on a heavy-duty wash cycle.</p>
<p>All of the glass containers cleaned beautifully. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> was the only plastic food container and lid that showed no signs of damage. The other plastic containers were deeply stained and pitted, the worst being the Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids.</p>
<h3>Odor retention</h3>
<p>Plastic food containers and silicone tend to retain food odors, so after dishwashing, we did a sniff test. Only the Vremi, the silicone container, smelled strongly of marinara sauce. The silicone gasket in the Glasslock lid didn’t retain food odor but instead had an acrid chemical odor.</p>
<h3>Retesting latches and leakproof capability</h3>
<p>Amazon reviewers frequently complain that after dishwashing and microwaving, the latches are too difficult to close, and we found this to be true only with the Glasslock and OXO. However, we opened and closed the OXO’s latches several times, and they worked normally again. Although the Vremi’s silicone container held up in the dishwasher, one of its plastic lid’s latches had cracked after a single wash.</p>
<p>Finally, we repeated our leakproof test to see if freezing, microwaving and dishwashing had any structural effect on the containers. The same three that failed the first time — Pyrex, Sistema and Prep Naturals — leaked again. But this time the 1790 also leaked.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance</a> 14-piece set is made of Tritan, a BPA-free plastic that resembles glass, but it’s shatter resistant and more durable than other plastics. The seven lids for the seven containers are also made of Tritan, which allow you to see their contents from all sides in the refrigerator. The set includes a large 9.6-cup container, two medium 3.2-cup containers and four small 1.3-cup containers.</p>
<p>Each container in this attractive set is rectangular with flat lids that are slightly recessed, so you can stack them in the refrigerator without fearing they’ll topple.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, a thick silicone gasket inside the inner lip of the lid floats on top of the container. When you press down on the lid, air is expelled out of the container through the lid’s vent holes with a whoosh. The two small latches on the long sides snap shut and create an airtight seal, which proved to be 100-percent leakproof.</p>

<p>The containers also have one-quarter-inch extensions at opposite ends, which stay cool when you lift the hot container out of the microwave.</p>
<p>Online instructions advise that turmeric will stain the Tritan plastic but tomato-based sauces will not. Our marinara sauce did stain the container and lid very slightly, but it was much less than on other containers we tested.</p>
<p>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance made it through the heavy-duty dishwashing cycle and showed no signs of pitting or scratching. Except for the rosy tint left by the spaghetti sauce in the container’s beveled edges, the container and lid looked brand new.</p>
<p>The only thing we didn’t like about the Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance is that the silicone gaskets cannot be removed from the lids. The gasket bends so you can scrub underneath its ridges, but to completely avoid odor retention, the entire lid would need to be submerged in cleaning solution.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance is reasonably priced for such a high-quality product. It’s available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNEJSO/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">6-piece</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNEIC6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10-piece</a> sets, and you can also buy various sizes individually if you need more of one size than another. The 1.3-cup size, which is perfect for packing school lunches or snacks, are available in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077M4T91S/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">very affordable two-pack</a>.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance proved resistant to microwaving and dishwashing, and we believe it will outlast all of the other plastic food containers we tested.</p>

<p>Glass containers are much easier to clean than plastic, and you don’t have to worry about BPAs and phthalates. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Smart Seal</a> was our favorite of the glass containers. It’s made of borosilicate glass, so it can withstand changes in temperature and go from the freezer to the microwave or a preheated oven.</p>
<p>What made OXO stand out from the other finalists is the thick silicone gasket that’s set into a channel in the lid. The gasket is made of soft silicone and floats on top of the container, so when you press down, not only does it make an airtight seal, the latches are easy to lock into place. The silicone gasket slips right off for cleaning and slides back into the lid’s channel with no effort.</p>

<p>The OXO performed perfectly in all our tests. It was leakproof, airtight, and the marinara sauce heated evenly in the microwave and oven. Although the glass container emerged sparkling clean from the dishwasher, the plastic lid was moderately stained. A big plus, however, is that the silicone gasket could be removed for washing.</p>
<p>OXO’s glass containers are a little more expensive than the others we tested, but the OXO’s sturdy lid and latches made the strongest seal and were the easiest to clean.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C6LRW61/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fullstar &#8211; 12-Pack</a> has five different sizes in rectangular, square and round shapes. They’re made of regular polypropylene plastic like the other containers we tested, so after microwaving and dishwashing they got stained and pitted. Its silicone gasket is embedded in the lid’s channel, and it needed to be precisely lined up or the latches wouldn’t close properly.</p>
<p>The Fullstar was leakproof and airtight and remained so after our testing. The container survived the microwave and dishwasher, but its lid warped and became convex.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSKSG1M/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 2063704 Easy Find Vented Lids</a> was one of our early favorites. Like traditional Rubbermaid or Tupperware, the lid snaps on top of the container and is then removed with a corner tab. We found the lids very easy to open and close. A square vent, which snaps up and down, is intended for releasing steam in the microwave. The Rubbermaid was the only plastic container that had a lid designed for the microwave.</p>
<p>The Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids design was leakproof, even with the vent. Surprisingly, it was even airtight. But the marinara sauce proved its downfall. After microwaving and dishwashing, the container was deeply stained and massively pitted. Although the lid still closed easily, and the container was still leakproof, it was clear that the Rubbermaid &#8211; Easy Find Lids wouldn’t last.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NSJ88V8/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sistema &#8211; Klip-It</a> are rectangular, divided containers for storing two different food items. The small size, which comes in a pack of three, are quite tiny, and can only really fit baby carrots and small grapes inside. The 4-cup container is a good size for school or work lunch, and the 8-cup container is for storing leftovers. Two problems plague the Sistema containers: They’re not leakproof or airtight, so if you’re toting something with liquid, expect to find it pooled in the bottom of your bag. Also, the dividers aren’t high enough to reach the lid, so liquid or sauce on one side easily leaks into the opposite side.</p>
<p>We really wanted to love the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071JVT2HC/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vremi &#8211; VRM020376N silicone</a> containers. Their four rectangular sizes are in bright primary colors, and because the containers are made of silicone, they collapse to one-third of their fully expanded height. We researched several silicone containers, and most buckle when you secure the lid, resulting in an explosion of anything liquid inside. The Vremi containers, however, have a rigid lip, so after some practice, we were able to snap on the lid without the sides buckling in.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Vremi was neither leakproof nor airtight, and after its round through the dishwasher, one of the lid’s latches had cracked, and the container reeked of marinara. Great idea but poorly executed.</p>

<p>None of the glass containers showed any signs of damage from the freezer, microwave or dishwasher. The plastic lids, however, differentiated one from the other.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LN7X92K/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glasslock &#8211; 11339</a> was leakproof and airtight, but its hinges were stiff to close. The smaller ends snapped on and off without too much struggle, but there was more resistance from the hinges on the long side of the container. We had to press down very hard to get the hinges to secure. Although the glass container itself is fine, someone with weak hand strength would be frustrated by these lids.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N90AWNF/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1790 &#8211; Glass Meal Prep Containers</a> did well in our tests. The latches were easy to lock and unlock, and when sealed, they were leakproof and airtight. 1790’s label warnings about the glass containers are a bit scary; it’s a long list of don’ts, some in capital letters. The containers are made of durable borosilicate glass, yet the manufacturer states that hot glass could shatter if the container is placed on a countertop, metal surface or sink.</p>
<p>We were justifiably nervous about what to do with the hot 1790 when we removed it from the oven. We opted for the marble counter, and thankfully, no explosion occurred.</p>
<p>After dishwashing, the 1790’s lid was stained and slightly pitted. The latches still closed easily, but now the seal was no longer leakproof.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075BLP5XV/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prep Naturals</a> is a popular brand with people who use the containers for meal prep. The containers are divided in two, so you can store two different portions of food in them. Since the dividing glass wall doesn’t reach the lid, anything that’s liquid on one side will leach into the other side. When sealed, the Prep Naturals were neither leakproof nor airtight; so much water had been absorbed by the tissue, we had to squeeze it out. After dishwashing, the lid was stained and pitted, and the latches were difficult to snap shut. As for cleaning, food particles were trapped between the gasket and the lid and could not be removed.</p>
<p>We tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0157G34AY/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pyrex &#8211; 1123268 Simply Store</a> set, because it was frequently mentioned by Amazon reviewers as their long-time favorite. It passed the freezer, microwave and oven tests, and its lid was not harmed by the dishwasher. From the beginning, however, the lid was difficult to snap on, and we had to pry it off before it would release from the container. Naturally, we thought this would indicate that the Pyrex would be airtight and leakproof. But the Pyrex performed just as poorly as the Prep Naturals.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>Plastic food containers are great for storing food in the refrigerator or freezer and for carrying lunch or leftovers to work or school. They’re less expensive than glass, but as our tests showed, microwaving and machine-dishwashing damages both the containers and their lids. You’ll probably want to replace them after a few months of use.</p>
<p>An exception was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JCNETC0/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rubbermaid &#8211; 1977447 Brilliance</a>, our top pick for plastic food container. The Rubbermaid &#8211; Brilliance was 100-percent leakproof and airtight, and although it stained very slightly — much less than the other plastic containers we tested — its durable Tritan plastic retained clarity and structure over the course of our rigorous tests. It’s a quality product for a reasonable price.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to worry about potential health hazards from plastic, our favorite glass food storage container was the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075GRTNN6/?tag=ybdfdstor-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OXO Good Grips &#8211; Smart Seal</a>. The OXO is more expensive than other glass containers (not to mention plastic containers), but its unique removable silicone gasket ensures a perfect seal. The OXO is leakproof, airtight, freezer-, microwave- and dishwasher-safe and will hold up for years.<br />

<p>The age-old question is what <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts/cleaning/">cleaning products</a> are safe for hardwood floors, but there isn’t a one-size-fits all cleaning solution.</p>
<p>You’ll want to consult with your hardwood floor manufacturer to learn what products are best fit for cleaning your floors specifically. If you’re unable to consult with your manufacturer or a professional, select a cleaning product that is only used for cleaning hardwood floors.</p>
<p>Some homeowners recommend cleaning hardwood floors naturally with vinegar and water, but if you opt to make your own natural solution, try it out on an inconspicuous spot in the corner of a less frequented room or under a piece of furniture that you don’t plan on moving (such as a refrigerator). Vinegar is known to dull some hardwood flooring finishes, so don’t make the mistake of using a product that your floors are new to before testing it first.</p>
<p>If you have waxed wood floors, it’s recommended to avoid any water or solution completely. Instead, regularly sweep or vacuum, and run a microfiber cloth across the floors to remove any fine dust particles.</p>
<h2>Step-by-step for cleaning hardwood floors</h2>
<p>Be confident that you’re cleaning your hardwood floors the right way to keep them looking as good as new for years.</p>

<p>Use a soft-bristled broom to sweep your floors against the grain to remove any loose dirt or dust from your floor. If you have <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-pet-hair-vacuum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pet hair</a> or hard-to-reach spots, you can also use a <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vacuum</a> for this step, but make sure only to use a soft floor nozzle as carpet beaters can damage hardwood finish.</p>

<p>Use a cleaning solution that best suited for your type of hardwood floors and dampen (not soak) a rag and run it along your floor. Cover the entire floor, but don’t allow too much time to pass so it doesn’t dry.</p>

<p>Don’t allow your floors to build up with dirt and grime. It’s recommended to mop floors in high-traffic areas, such as the kitchen, living room and family room, on a biweekly basis. You can mop less-frequented rooms on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>The last thing you want to do if you have a stain on your hardwood floor is scratch the surface and damage the sealant. Be gentle and take your time with stain removal as your flooring can be delicate.</p>
<p><strong>Watermarks</strong>. If you have a watermark on your floor, allow it a couple of days to dry to see if it will clear up on its own. If not, determine how your hardwood floor is finished: with wax, which penetrates the wood or with surface finish, which seals the top layer of the wood.</p>
<p>For waxed floors, lightly rub the stain with #000 steel wool and wax. If this doesn’t work and the stain is deeper, lightly sand the area, then stain, wax and buff the area by hand. If you’re not confident with sanding down your floors yourself or do not have the tools, you may need to consult with a professional who specializes in sealing hardwood floors. If your floor is treated with surface finish, use a cleaner that is specifically used for cleaning that type of finish.</p>
<p>If your hardwood floor is unfinished, consult with your manufacturer as water or hardwood cleaners could damage the wood.</p>
<p><strong>Non-greasy spills</strong>. You can typically remove non-greasy food or drinks from surfaces by simply combining dish detergent and warm water and applying it with a cloth in a circular motion. Similar to mopping, make sure to remove the solution with a rag dampened with water and then a dry cloth.</p>
<p><strong>Greasy spills</strong>. We get it. It’s easy to spill oil, butter or other greasy properties on your hardwood floors without noticing. If this has happened to you, soak a cotton rag in hydrogen peroxide and allow it to sit on top of the stain for 5-10 minutes. Repeat until the stain has been removed. If you’re unsure how hydrogen peroxide and your hardwood floors will interact, test it on an inconspicuous section of your floor beforehand.</p>

<p><strong>Remove shoes</strong>. Create a policy to remove shoes at the door so no one brings in any outside dirt or gravel.</p>
<p><strong>Use tough-bristled doormats</strong>. Entering the house with dirty shoes is the main way to track in dirt. If you allow shoes in your home, place tough bristle door mats at every entrance to avoid tracking in too much dirt.</p>
<p><strong>Use floor protectors</strong>. It’s recommended to use floor protectors under heavy furniture to avoid from damaging your hardwood floors. If dirt or dust gets under your furniture without protectors, it could aggravate and scratch your floors.</p>
<p><strong>Routinely clean</strong>. Clean kitchen floors weekly and other areas of the house every 3-4 weeks to avoid any build up.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain and refinish</strong>. If your floors are damaged far beyond what cleaning can improve, you might be due for a refinishing. It’s common to refinish hardwood floors every 3-4 years to keep them in great shape.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t ignore a mess</strong>. If you spill something, even if only a drip of water or ice cube, you’ll want to clean it up immediately as added moisture can quickly damage your floor.</p>
<p><strong>Lift heavy items</strong>. If you have heavy equipment in your home for a remodel or furniture that you’re moving around, make sure not to drag it across the floor as it can damage your hardwood floors.</p>
<p>Whether you’re redoing a section of your home and have heavy equipment in and out of the house, or have purchased a new piece of furniture for your home, make sure not to drag anything across your hardwood floor as it could cause irreversible damage.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to clean, remove stains and protect your hardwood floors, your floors are bound to remain in great shape for years to come.</p>

<h2 id="why-buy">Why buy a KitchenAid stand mixer?</h2>
<p>Simply put, it’s the best. We rigorously <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stand-mixer/">tested five highly rated stand mixers</a>, and the KitchenAid Artisan was the clear champion over the others. If you’re a daily baker or a holiday baker, any KitchenAid stand mixer is an essential appliance for your kitchen.</p>
<p>All KitchenAid stand mixers combine heavy-duty steel construction with a powerful motor. Depending on its size and wattage, a KitchenAid makes short work of any tedious baking task, such as blending thick cookie dough stuffed with mix-ins or kneading pizza dough.</p>
<p>Any KitchenAid stand mixer has been built to last a lifetime. We’ve worked with the KitchenAid Pro 600 for nearly 15 years, and it’s still churning out and humming along as well as the first day we flipped the on switch.</p>
<p>These are workhorses; and like the proverbial workhorse, they’re solid and heavy. The Artisan and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SGFW/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Classic </a> — both are the compact, tilt-head style —  weigh in at 23 pounds. The Professional is a hefty 29 pounds. So you really need to have some kitchen-counter real estate where the KitchenAid can live, since it’s too heavy to hoist it up to a cabinet.</p>

<p>All KitchenAid stand mixers have a unique built-in that no other stand mixer has: a power hub. This portal on the mixer’s head allows you to plug in 15 attachments, ranging from a pasta roller to a spiralizer, <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/the-best-spiralizer/">like the spiralizers we reviewed</a>, to an ice cream maker, one that&#8217;s smaller and just as functional as those we reviewed in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-ice-cream-maker/">best ice cream maker</a> article.</p>
<p>Finally, you’re probably aware that a KitchenAid stand mixer is more expensive than other stand mixers. You’ll spend between $200 to $325 on a KitchenAid stand mixer, but with all of the available attachments that can do practically any cooking-prep job, you’ll push your culinary skills to new levels.</p>

<p>KitchenAid has been manufacturing stand mixers for 100 years, and during that century, they’ve given several facelifts to their models. There are three core models that KitchenAid occasionally updates: the Classic, the Pro 600 and the Artisan. (KitchenAid also makes a very large Commercial mixer, but these are really intended for bakeries or home-baking businesses.)</p>
[table id=265 /]
<h3>Classic</h3>
<p>The Classic Series has a tilt-head design, meaning the head of the mixer swivels back, which allows easy access to the mixing bowl. The Classic’s mixing bowl is 4.5 quarts and has no handle. The bowl is slightly tapered and locks into the bottom of the mixer’s stand. The Classic has 10 variable speeds controlled by a side lever.</p>
<p>The Classic has 275 watts and is a planetary-motion mixer, which means the attachments revolve while the bowl remains stationary. Although the Classic’s wattage is somewhat less than the Artisan and Pro 600, all KitchenAid stand mixers have been engineered to use wattage for creating exceptional torque — the force needed to rotate an object — which is particularly needed for kneading bread or pizza dough and mixing dense cookie dough.</p>
<p>The Classic has 59 touch points per rotation; every time the wire whisk, dough hook or flat beater (included with all KitchenAid mixers) revolves around the bowl, it will touch the bowl 59 times. The more touch points per rotation, the less you will need to scrape the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>True to its name, the Classic is only available in two colors, white and silver.</p>
<h3>Artisan</h3>
<p>The Artisan has all of the same features of the Classic, but its power is boosted to 325 watts. The Artisan has a 5-quart tapered bowl with a handle that also locks into the stand. The same accessories are included, but the Artisan’s flat beater has a raised silicone edge, which virtually eliminates scraping the bowl. Like the Classic, the Artisan also has a 10-speed motor and 59 touch points per rotation.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to match your appliances with your kitchen, the Artisan comes in a veritable rainbow of 44 colors.</p>
<h3>Pro 600</h3>
<p>KitchenAid&#8217;s Pro 600 Series shares some core features with the Classic and Artisan models. It differs, however, in that it has a bowl-lift design. The 6-quart bowl latches onto two side arms and the back of the stand. A lever raises the bowl to the attachment; when mixing is complete, the bowl lowers back to the base.</p>
<p>The Pro 600 is also larger, heavier, and its wattage is amped up to 575. With 67 touch points per rotation, the wide whisk and flat beater (one-third larger than the Classic and Artisan) and the elongated dough hook miss nothing in the bowl.</p>
<h2 id="tested">How we tested</h2>
<p>Since we already tested the Artisan in our stand mixer review, we repeated the same tests with the Classic and Pro 600.</p>

<p><b>Egg whites:</b> For each mixer, we put two room-temperature egg whites into the bowl and started the mixer at its lowest setting. When the egg whites began to foam, we increased the speed to the highest level and timed how long it took for the egg whites to reach a meringue consistency.</p>

<p><b>Cream: </b>The Artisan easily whipped one cup of chilled heavy cream to fluffy peaks. We repeated the test with the Classic and Pro 600 by whipping the cream at its lowest setting and gradually increasing to the highest and timed how long it took for the mixer to whip the cream.</p>
<h3>Cake batter</h3>
<p>We used “The Great British Baking Show” judge <a href="https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/mary_berrys_perfect_34317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Berry’s recipe for genoise</a>, or sponge cake, which serves as the base for an assortment of iced and jelly-filled cakes. We made this recipe many times during our initial testing, and it’s especially good for showing how well (or poorly) the stand mixer whips the ingredients together to create a light and airy cake with a soft crumb.</p>
<h3>Cookie dough</h3>
<p>As we discovered from our prior tests, cookie dough can cause havoc with almost all stand mixers. Depending on the shape of the bowl and length of attachments, oftentimes mixins just aren’t mixed in enough. This failing was more than apparent with the <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stand-mixer/">Cheftronic &#8211; SM986 and Cuisinart SM-50 </a>, both of which left mixins in the bottom of their deeply tapered bowls and short attachments.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/super-chunky-cookies-3362198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recipe </a> we used is a dense dough jammed full with chocolate chips, peanuts and M&amp;Ms. This test really showcases the motor’s ability to create the torque needed to thoroughly blend these heavy ingredients into a cohesive dough.</p>
<h3>Pizza dough</h3>
<video class="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source data-src="https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kneading-dough.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>This is the most challenging test of all. It’s a <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/pizza-dough-recipe-1914764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standard recipe for pizza dough</a> that we’ve made dozens of times. Earlier models of stand mixers had an extenuated dough hook that was curled like a pig’s tail. The latest models have dough hooks that are about one-third shorter and have a more traditional hook shape.</p>
<p>In our previous tests, only the Artisan blended and kneaded the dough effortlessly. The other mixers struggled to make a cohesive dough with the new dough hook, and the strain on their  motors caused the mixers to shake and rattle like the Northridge Earthquake.</p>

<p>The 5-quart, tilt-head <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PS Artisan</a> stand mixer won <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stand-mixer/#best">best overall in our review of stand mixers,</a> and it’s our top pick again. The Artisan is the most popular of KitchenAid’s stand mixers, and it’s easy to understand why. The Artisan is about 20 percent smaller than the Pro 600, and the tilt-head design makes the mixer more compact so it can fit underneath most kitchen cabinets.</p>
<p>At 375 watts, the Artisan has plenty of power to tackle bread, pizza and chunky cookie dough. The usual attachments are included: A wire whisk, flat paddle and dough hook. The flat paddle and dough hook are nylon-coated for easy cleaning.</p>
<p>We found the Artisan’s pouring shield especially useful when we added flour to the pizza dough. It fits over the mixing bowl and allows you to add dry or wet ingredients while the mixer is mixing. The pouring shield eliminated spills and concentrated the flour into a spout, which the dough hook efficiently turned into the vortex of the mixture.</p>

It’s fast, versatile and very user-friendly.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The Artisan has a slightly tapered stainless steel bowl, and its attachments have been designed specifically to reduce the need for scraping ingredients down the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>The Artisan performed perfectly in all of our tests. It whipped the egg whites and cream to firm peaks in one minute and smoothly blended the cake batter, which baked light, airy and delicate. The Artisan had no problems mixing together the cookie dough, although there were a few M&amp;M bits in the bottom of the bowl. The hook attachment is less curlicue than the Pro 600’s, but the Artisan nevertheless mixed and kneaded an elastic ball of pizza dough in five minutes.</p>
<p>The Artisan is so easy to use you’ll find yourself baking like a professional in no time. Like all three KitchenAid stand mixers, the Artisan is expensive. But if you’re new to baking or you’re someone who wants to bake more than cupcakes and Christmas cookies, the Artisan is an investment you should make.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The KitchenAid Artisan is a tilt-head-style stand mixer and compact enough to fit under most kitchen cabinets.</li>
<li>The Artisan has plenty of power to handle dense bread and cookie dough.</li>

<p>If you’re an ardent baker and an all-day baking binge is a regular past time, then the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Y5X9W/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; Pro 600 </a> is your best choice. It’s only about $50 more than the Artisan, but we feel the substantially increased power, rock-solid construction and excellent ease of use is worth that small difference in price.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the Pro 600 is a big piece of machinery. It’s made entirely of metal, so it’s quite heavy — 29 pounds — and once you’ve unpacked the Pro 600, it’s not going anywhere. Look elsewhere if your kitchen counter space is limited.</p>
<p>Like all KitchenAid stand mixers, the Pro 600’s 575-watt motor has direct drive transmission, which means that its system of (all-steel) gears directly transfers power to whatever you’re mixing in the bowl. There’s less power consumption, and it mixes everything faster.</p>
<p>The proof, of course, is in the pudding &#8212; or the cake batter. The Pro 600 beat the other two KitchenAid stand mixers by 15 to 20 seconds in every challenge, due, in part, to its wire whisk and flat paddle being one-third larger. When the bowl is lifted into place, the attachments touch the bottom of the bowl and the sides. With its 67 touch points, every last ounce of ingredient is whisked or beaten.</p>

This hefty beauty substantially reduces time and effort in all baking tasks.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Y5X9W/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank"><button>See Price at Amazon.com</button></a></div></div>
<p>The results? Egg whites were beaten to meringue consistency in 55 seconds, the cream was fluffed to peaks in a minute. The cake baked light and airy with a delicate and moist crumb, and the cookies had a cake-like texture, which made us want to eat the entire batch in one sitting. (We restrained from doing so, barely.)</p>

<p>The Pro 600’s dough hook recalls what Captain Hook wore at his wrist. Its elongated, curlicue shape reaches the bottom of the bowl, so when we started the mixer at its lowest setting, the hook gently mixed the ingredients with no splatter. We increased the speed to 2 (there are 10 levels) and watched in amazement how the hook gathered everything together into a dough ball. Not once did we need to scrape the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>We increased the speed to 3 and allowed the mixer to do its work, kneading the pizza dough until it was smooth and elastic. It really doesn’t get easier. As we did in our prior tests — and you shouldn’t do this at home — we increased the speed to its highest level while the mixer was kneading the dough. The bowl vibrated, but the heavy-metal stand held its ground and stayed in place.</p>
<p>KitchenAid intuited that most people will not store the Pro 600 in a cabinet, and so they’ve designed them in 22 different shades to fit any kitchen’s color scheme. If you prefer a vintage look, a tempered-glass mixing bowl is available.</p>
<p>The Pro 600 is the most expensive of the three KitchenAid stand mixers. The Pro 600 won’t fit everyone’s budget, and if you don’t have spacious countertops, you should consider the Artisan instead.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The KitchenAid &#8211; Pro 600 is a sturdily constructed, high-power kitchen workhorse and makes short work of any baking mixing task.</li>
<li>Its 6-quart bowl allows you to make several loaves of bread or up to 13 dozen cookies in a single batch.</li>
<li>The Pro 600&#8217;s bowl and attachments are designed to virtually eliminate any hand-mixing or scraping of the bowl.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s the most expensive of the KitchenAid mixers we tested, but if you bake everyday, it&#8217;s a worthwhile investment. The Pro 600 is built to last for years.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004SGFW/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; K45SS Classic</a> is the least expensive stand mixer in the KitchenAid line. It’s well-made and performed almost as well as the Artisan. However, in our <a href=https://elated-haibt-08eb7d.netlify.com/reviews/best-stand-mixer/">review of stand mixers</a>, we recommended the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000308BUI/?tag=ybdmix-20">Hamilton Beach &#8211; 63232</a> as an alternative to the Artisan. Since it’s about $25 less than the Classic and on a par with the Artisan, if you’re looking for a budget-priced stand mixer, consider the Hamilton Beach.</p>
<p>The Classic has 275 watts and at 4.5-quarts, its bowl is slightly smaller than the Artisan. It has the same attachments, but it lacks a splatter shield. (We checked KitchenAid’s website, and a separately purchased splatter shield for the Classic is not available.) In many respects, the Classic is identical to the Artisan; however, we did notice some minor differences in its performance.</p>
<p>The Classic whipped the egg whites and cream about 15 seconds slower, which is hardly a deal breaker. However, at its highest speed, the motor fluctuated and seemed to slow down for a second. We tested this several times, and the slight fluctuation was consistent. Since we only tested one model of the Classic, this issue might pertain only to the model we tested.</p>
<p>The Classic’s flat beater doesn’t have the silicone edge that the Artisan has, so it couldn’t reach all of the ingredients. This was the only KitchenAid mixer that made us scrape the bowl. We mixed ingredients thoroughly, but the cake rose unevenly with divets on the surface. Minor discrepancies can always happen in baking, but the cake’s texture was noticeably less airy and light.</p>
<p>The cookies mixed together quickly (42 seconds), but we couldn’t increase the speed past level 3 without the ingredients splattering. When we removed the dough, about one-quarter cup of M&amp;Ms were left behind in the bottom of the bowl. The pizza hook was just as effective as it was in the other models, and the Classic produced an elastic dough in a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="bottom">The bottom line</h2>
<p>You really can’t go wrong buying a KitchenAid stand mixer. They’re solid, built to last and can perform heavy-duty mixing, blending, whipping and kneading in a few effortless minutes. For someone who enjoys baking on a weekly or even daily basis, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Y5X9W/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KP26M1X Pro 600</a> is your best bet for handling high-volume baking.</p>
<p>If you’re a first-time baker or a seasoned professional, the smaller, less-expensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006WNOZ/?tag=ybdkaid-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KitchenAid &#8211; KSM150PS Artisan</a> has plenty of power for both daily and occasional baking. The Artisan matches the Pro 600’s performance, but its tilt-head design makes it more compact so it can fit many kitchen-counter spaces.</p>
